He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day. Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event.‘They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.’However, Dolphin also contradicted the assertion by Kavanaugh’s lawyers that the two shared a brief kiss in high school.‘I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,’ she told The New York Times through her lawyer.Kavanaugh was one of 13 graduating seniors who reportedly mentioned Dolphin in some way in the yearbook. One former student, Michael Walsh, wrote a poem in his yearbook that said: ‘You need a date  and it\u0027s getting late  so don\u0027t hesitate  to call Renate.’According to a person close to Dolphin, she was aware of the poem being recited by her former classmates and requested that they stop saying it.Kavanaugh has come under intense scrutiny lately for allegedly sexually assaulting former classmates Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.

View days: Multiple sources tell DailyMail.com that Rosie O\u0027Donnell is the top choice, while other names being floated around include Ann Curry and Lisa Ling (O\u0027Donnell and Barbara Walters on The View)          Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime. We are grateful for her many other contributions, respect her decision and wish Julie all the best in everything she does.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/21/4E919DF000000578-0-image-a-5_1532550973907.jpg","title":"Who Kamala Harris Senator revealed amid talk 2020 President run","story":"    Kamala Harris began her questioning of Christine Blasey Ford by praising her and reminding her she was not on trial      Ryder Cup 2018: Teams, matches and schedule revealedWho is Kamala Harris?

The lifting of student number controls in England in 2015 gave universities free rein to recruit as many undergraduates as they saw fit.The Government’s Higher Education Initial Participation Rate is an estimate of the likelihood of a young person studying for a sub-degree, first degree or a postgraduate course by the age of 30, based on current participation rates. By this measure, participation rose by 0.7 percentage points from 49.1 per cent in 201516 to 49.8 per cent in 201617.The Department for Education dataset – which rounds up the proportion to 50 per cent – says this equates to 333,490 students, up from 332,000.Those entering higher education immediately after school also reached a record high last year, with 28 per cent of 18-year-olds in study. This is the fourth year in a row this measure has increased.          Students in England are predicted to graduate with average debts of £50,800Last week, Education Secretary Damian Hinds toured Germany and Holland to learn more about their vocational education systems. He attacked ‘snobbery’ and ‘outdated attitudes’ towards vocational qualifications, insisting children at every type of school must be aware of the ‘range of possibilities’, including degree apprenticeships.He stressed that for many young people ‘the right choice will be to go to university – but for some it might not be’.Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ‘These figures highlight that young people up and down the country clearly recognise the value of studying at one of our world-class universities, and we want that to continue.‘We recognise there is more to do to level the playing field and ensure more people with the talent and potential get a fair crack of the whip wherever they live.’The Government is carrying out a review of post-18 education and funding ‘to ensure that the system provides genuine choice and opportunity for everyone’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/11/4D21013100000578-0-image-a-13_1528972598534.jpg","title":"Move pound shops rise 5 store only5Pounds","story":"    Only5Pounds has opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Northampton (pictured above)          Only5Pounds mostly sells home and DIY products as well as some electricals and toysThe first Only5Pounds shop is up-and-running in Northampton, selling most of the same products it does online as well as some store-exclusive food and drink items - around 2,400 items in total. The business hopes to target other areas in the south such as Harrow, Luton and Watford in the near future, before venturing into the Midlands next year.It told This is Money that it is making a beeline for the shops that were left vacant by Poundworld when it sunk into administration earlier this year.Does the demise of Poundworld portend gloom for all \u0027value\u0027...How did John Lewis ¿ the UK¿s High Street darling ¿ have...Estate agent closures to add to High Street malaise as...Share this articleThe collapse triggered around 5,000 job losses and left 350 UK stores up for grabs.Managing director Vinod Chopra said: \u0027The aim is for people to feel that they are getting good value for money. \u0027We want to bring online prices to the high street so everyone can benefit from the savings.\u0027 While the move into physical stores may seem counter-intuitive, Only5Pounds is not the first online business to make the shift from \u0027clicks to bricks\u0027.Online furniture firm Swoon has set up shop inside Debenhams stores, Made.com continues to open showrooms across Europe and even Amazon has touched down on the High Street with its own book shops and the acquisition of Whole Foods.  The retailer said its stock will \u0027always remain at £5\u0027, but the fixed-price model has proven a bind to some retailers in the past.Poundworld, for example, was stung by the falling value of sterling in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. As well as being guilty of over-expanding, Poundworld was wed to its £1 price point for too long, which meant it had very little wiggle room and its margins suffered.    Fixed price retailers like Poundworld have struggled to manage the falling value of the poundHowever, Chopra insisted that the model keeps it \u0027simple and consistent for the customer\u0027. He added that by buying products directly from the factory, the business will be able to offer low prices – even when it has additional costs associated with stores – business rates and rents, for example.The Only5Pounds shops will double as click-and-collect points so shoppers can order online and pick up in store. Another website also sells products entirely at a £5 price point - everything5pounds.com - which specialises in fashion.Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":null,"title":"David Hockney unveils stained glass countryside tribute Queen","story":"    David Hockney has unveiled a stained glass window tribute to the Queen at Westminster Abbey, saying: \u0027I hope she\u0027ll like it\u0027The brightly-coloured abstract window of yellow, red, blue, pink, orange and greens, features hawthorn blossom and stands out in its historic setting.Hockney said the iPad was \u0027a natural thing to use\u0027 because it is \u0027back-lit like a window\u0027.The much-loved artist, who recently broke his own auction record with a £21.1 million painting, said that designing his first stained glass window \u0027was a challenge\u0027 adding: \u0027I\u0027ve learnt something about glass.\u0027Stunning wall hanging painted by soldiers returning from the...Never-before-seen letter from Wallis Simpson that hints at...Hamleys reveal their top 12 Christmas toys including Crate...Share this articleHe said of wanting to depict the countryside: \u0027Landscape is nature.

Here’s all you need to know about her, including her relationship with Kavanaugh and the allegations she’s made against him.Who is Julie Swetnick?Julie Swetnick is the third woman to publicly allege that U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct.Swetnick, 55, currently lives in Washington, D.C. and attended the University of Maryland and Montgomery College.She’s reportedly spent years working for the Federal government in Washington, D.C., including currently at the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Mint and has previously held security clearances for the Department of Justice, the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security.Additionally, she’s also believed to have previously worked with the Vietnam War Commission and is reportedly one of the first 100 women in the entire world to have earned a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineering Certification.While attending high school in Gaithersburg, Maryland between in the early 1980s, she claims to have met Kavanaugh at a house party in the Washington, D.C. area and says she was present when Kavanaugh and his friends, including Mark Judge, allegedly drugged girls’ drinks and participated in gang rapes.According to a sworn declaration released by Avenatti on Twitter, Swetnick alleges: ‘I first met Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh in approximately 1980-1981. I was introduced to them at a house party that I attended in the Washington D.C. area.‘Following that first introduction, I attended well over ten house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present…‘On numerous occasions at these parties, I witnessed Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking no for an answer. This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. Ryder Cup 2018: Teams, matches and schedule revealedWho is Kamala Harris?

Meghan closing her own car door before walking into the opening of \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts Royal experts are thrilled that their cast of characters is being expanded as Kate Middleton is returning to ‘work’ soon after her maternity leave - apparently those appearances at posh weddings were ‘private’ events, in case you wondered.This week the royal watchers went into overdrive, signalling that September 2018 will go down in the history books as the moment when a smiley mixed race woman finally dragged the British monarchy into the 21st century.It was accomplished with a simple- some might say humble- gesture, one that summed up (according to sycophants) her totally ‘modern’ approach to her new toff status. Yes, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, CLOSED HER OWN CAR DOOR!JANET STREET-PORTER: It may be a Rotten public image, but let’s salute King of Punk John Lydon for letting it all hang out – and sneering at the Instagram generationJANET STREET-PORTER: Rees-Mogg\u0027s nanny-botherer is a nasty piece of work but I\u0027ve still got more time for him than Serena pretending her tantrums are a political protest JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an unfortunate few minutes of television turned into a terrifying witch-hunt of one of the nicest women I knowJANET STREET-PORTER: If Harry, Meghan and Eugenie want to live it large like reality TV stars they\u0027d better have a Plan B... when the paying public has had enough JANET STREET-PORTER: Boris Johnson is a buffoon but if there\u0027s one thing we all need to agree on it\u0027s that our society is built on the absolute freedom to disagreeJANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become anti-social yobs, their parents must pay tooThe nanny-state panic over Britain’s heatwave makes my blood boil, says JANET STREET-PORTER. They know how to cope with the sun Down Under… so it’s time to send for the Aussies! JANET STREET-PORTER: If there was any evidence against Cliff he should have been tried in court, not on the BBC news by a hysterical reporter and a bunch of publicity hungry copsJANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises, two-faced Theresa and duplicitous Boris have tossed their green principles in the trashArriving at London’s Royal Academy on her first solo engagement, to open Oceania, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of the Pacific, Meghan stepped out of her limo - the door held open by a flunkey - then, turned around and closed it.Job done, she could get on with meeting a lineup of important people, delivering a short speech, and rubbing noses with a group of maori dancers and performers.Immediately, the Sun’s Royal Correspondent was congratulating the Duchess for showing she could still ‘take the time’ for these simple little tasks. Etiquette expert William Hanson offered up his take on door-gate, in case we hadn’t understood it’s importance - ‘it is usually done by others for security reasons’.I find that closing the car door is also a good idea if the weather is windy, in case it blows back on your leg, wrecking your £25 Wolford designer tights, or (worse) mows down a passing cyclist, who will start shouting obscenities.Meghan had clearly practised for this earth-shattering moment. Arriving at the launch of a charity cookbook in aid of the Grenfell survivors with her mother a few days earlier, she leapt out of the back seat and quickly shut the door.I’m sure security staff are already mulling over the implications of her impetuous actions - more of this kind of behaviour could result in staff redundancies.          The gesture generated praise for Meghan\u0027s humble attitude, but Janet Street-Porter is not convincedSadly, Meghan is not the trail-blazer we hoped - it has emerged that the Duchess of Cambridge has been shutting her own car door for some time, even whilst carrying Princess Charlotte in her arms back in 2016.Meghan might be trying to send a message that she’s the same simple girl, but as etiquette expert Mr Hanson reminds us ‘life is very different for Meghan now she’s joined The Firm -‘ no more selfies or autographs.No vote and no public social media’.Meghan says she’s a feminist who fights for women’s rights, but she signed away her chance to vote for our democracy. Maybe the chance to wear a procession of couture outfits costing thousands of pounds and live with a multi-millionaire made that bitter pill easier to swallow.          Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft, according to Janet Street-PorterAnd those four inch heels? They are not footwear women can fight in, they are unsteady and uncomfortable. A woman can wear what she chooses, but in Meghan’s position - cue the car door moment - everything she doessays and wears will be picked over.Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft. Meghan wants other women to feel comfortable and be themselves, not conform to hackneyed stereotypes, but she needs to lead by real example, not car door handle moments.She projects a very narrow, version of glamorous femininity, in complete contract to her mother, who seems much happier in her own skin and who has her own relaxed style.Fans gushed that the ‘door closing’ moment showed that Meghan was ‘humble’ and ‘down to earth’…’just like the rest of us’. According to the etiquette expert ‘she’s going to be doing things her way and helping to adapt and progress the British Monarchy’.As Private Eye would say, pass the sickbag. I find it’s easier to be modern when wearing a £2500 Givenchy dress and channelling Audrey Hepburn, although it’s not a look I plan to emulate on the London Underground any time soon.When it comes to Royal transport, Meghan is a fast learner, having made a mistake on her first public engagement with the Queen, by faffing about next to their car, and then asking Ma’am which side she fancied sitting on.Apparently the Queen ‘always sits behind the driver, although etiquette stipulates that the most senior person in a car should sit diagonally behind the chauffeur’.Just keep that pearl of wisdom in your mind, when you’re arguing about who gets the most leg room in the Uber home after a night out. And make sure you shut the door."},{"url":null,"title":"Britain enjoy final day sun 75F heat today","story":"    People paddle in the sea as they enjoy the fine autumnal weather at Lyme Regis  in Dorset this afternoon          People relax in the sun at Castle Park in Bristol today as parts of the UK enjoy temperatures above average for the time of year          Families make the most of the warm weather in Lyme Regis today as temperatures soar above the 70F mark in England          A man reads a newspaper as people enjoy the warm autumnal weather on the beach in Lyme Regis this afternoon            Scottish firefighter Scott MacLucas-Paton, 48, from the Isle of Skye in Scotland, spotted the end of this rainbow on Tuesday while climbing up Am Bhasteir mountain.

GP surgeries are already in crisis due to a shortage of GPs, combined with the growing pressures of the ageing population. An average of one in seven GP posts is unfilled.Professor Stokes-Lampard said many were leaving to work for Babylon and other firms where they could earn up to £120,000 a year. Others had cut down on their surgery hours to do a few sessions for these private firms a week, working from home, she said.\u0027It\u0027s the higher salaries, the ability to work from home and that they look after people, in terms of the training and perks and benefits. They\u0027re paying above what the NHS pays.\u0027Babylon Health offers patients ten-minute consultations – via smartphones or computers – for £25 a time. It provides these appointments free to patients who live or work in London if they de-register from their existing GP surgery and sign up with its practice in west London.A total of 32,000 patients have joined since its launch in November, including Mr Hancock, who described the service as \u0027revolutionary\u0027.The firm is planning to expand to Birmingham and Manchester over the next few months.A current job listing offers GPs a salary of £100,000 a year to work from home or £120,000 a year if they are based in the west London practice or one of four other London hubs.It promises doctors \u0027no home visits ever\u0027, \u0027no paperwork\u0027 and \u0027no never-ending duty days\u0027. This is where GPs have to remain on surgery premises to see emergency patients.Professor Stokes-Lampard is also concerned that the safety of online consultations has not been properly tested in a clinical trial – like a new drug.She will challenge Mr Hancock\u0027s endorsement of Babylon at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham next Monday.A Babylon spokesman said: \u0027The Royal College is absolutely right to highlight that practices all too often do not have enough GPs.

It only mattered that she was gayIt did not matter that Yvonne Sillett was the first female corporal in the Australian defence force responsible for training new recruits at the Kapooka army centre in Victoria. Nor did it matter that her work with the Signal Corps managing telecommunications and information systems was respected and valued by her superiors.What did matter to the Australian defence force at the time was that Sillett is gay. In 1988, when she was 28 years old and had been serving for almost a decade, she was called into an interview and questioned by two commanders.“It wasn’t an interview, it was an interrogation,” Sillett said. “They said, ‘We know that you’re a homosexual, we’ve been following you.’ I was denying everything but they’d been following me for several months.“After several hours of this questioning they said they would be taking the matter further and that, based on my sexuality, I could no longer be in Signal Corps as I’d be open to blackmail, and that they were downgrading my security clearance which was needed to do that job. They told me I’d never instruct women again.”She was ordered to provide the commanders with a list of names of other homosexual personnel, but she refused. Forced from the role she loved and afraid she would be outed, under constant surveillance and treated with contempt, Sillett felt compelled to request her own discharge and left the organisation which she once believed would provide a long-term career.“I was absolutely shattered,” she said. “I loved what I did, and had been a bit of a trailblazer for women in the army. It was all I had known, and the rug was yanked from under my feet. The trauma I experienced was up there with losing my mother, and there were suicidal thoughts.”Sillett’s mother knew she was gay and accepted her, but Sillett never told her why she left the army.“I didn’t want to break her heart,” she said. “I lost my mum later to melanoma and she died without knowing why I left.”Sillett is one of 130 former and present defence force personnel identifying as LGBT interviewed as part of research conducted by military academics associate professor Noah Riseman and associate professor Shirleene Robinson. Their work uncovering official historical policy documents and speaking with those affected by the former ban on homosexuals serving prompted them to call for a national apology to LGBT former military personnel.The researchers also believe a redress scheme should be implemented for those whose careers were cut short and affected by intrusive interrogations and surveillance. This redress could take the form of psychological support, an apology, and in some cases financial compensation. Riseman sent a policy brief to numerous politicians this week urging them to support an apology.The Greens senators Janet Rice and Peter Whish-Wilson wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the defence minister, Christopher Pyne, on Friday supporting the call.“We write regarding the horrific past discrimination of LGBT service members and their families carried out by the Australian Defence Force,” the letter states.“A recent report by ACU Associate professor Noah Riseman indicates that LGBT personnel were subject to invasive bodily exams, harrowing interviews that probed intimate personal details and surveillance of movements during and outside of service hours. These practices saw LGBT service members humiliated and intimidated, forcing them to resign their posts or be dishonourably discharged.“An apology and redress scheme will send a clear message that the ADF and the commonwealth government condemn these past discriminations and abuses, and to ensure ersity and inclusion continues within the ADF.”The prime minister’s office did not respond to questions from  Australia, saying it was a matter for defence. A defence spokeswoman said the department was aware of the push for a national apology.“Defence will review Prof Riseman’s proposal,” she said. “Defence is focused on increasing the ersity and inclusion of its workforce as a critical element of building capability.”The opposition defence spokesman, Richard Marles, said LGBT people in defence had “obviously been treated pretty poorly in the past”. But he said apologies only worked “when everyone’s on board”.“We’d obviously be open to hearing more about what’s being proposed, but it’s important that any effort of this kind is explored in an inclusive, bipartisan way,” he said.Records show between 1953 and 1992 at least 489 men and 165 women were investigated for being LGBT. Data provided to parliament in 1992 on discharges in the five years between 1987 to 1992 revealed 73 honourable discharges of lesbian, gay and bisexual people and 21 dishonourable discharges of LGB people across army, navy and RAAF. November marked 25 years since the ban was lifted on gays, lesbians and bisexuals serving in the Australian Defence Force.Neil James is the executive director of the Australia Defence Association, which describes itself as an independent, non-partisan, public interest watchdog for defence issues. James said his organisation would not be against a national apology and that it would “probably” achieve something. But he said the Australian defence force should not be blamed for implementing what was policy at the time.He said considering past events through a modern lens was “a crazy way of looking at things”. He added “there was no point listening to” Riseman, who he described as an “activist” who was “a little emotive about this” issue. He added that he did not believe the historical treatment of LGBT people was “a serious problem in the army and navy” but said it was more of an issue in the airforce, where security matters were investigated by RAAF police who took a more militant approach.“You also have to look at the era,” he said. “Women weren’t allowed to get married in defence, this wasn’t an unusual situation for the period the alleged persecution was occurring.”He added that he did not necessarily agree that LGBT people compelled to leave defence because of their sexuality had their careers significantly affected, because he said people at the time didn’t serve for long anyway.He added it was not homosexuality that defence targeted but the fact homosexuality was a criminal offence. “Because it was a criminal offence people could be blackmailed because they had a secret life and so could be manipulated by a foreign intelligence service,” he said.But Sillett responded “Are the Russians really going to care that I’m a gay lady?“Defence had a duty of care to look after us.”She recently filed a complaint with the defence ombudsman seeking an apology and compensation, but this claim was rejected.“The response I received said that what happened to me wasn’t considered serious bullying,” she said. “I was interrogated during my time serving this country. I was followed. These aren’t stories that are made-up. These are people’s lives that have been affected.“Except now, I’m older and wiser. I know I have nothing to hide or be embarrassed by.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d16a3180f360887884c32bbede68ebaf2def62e6/327_653_2802_1681/master/2802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a0644207628d9513223ed0f5ff843b3","title":"mcdonnells employee plan could drive tories to take ownership of it","story":"Workers want to know if they would be quids in when acquisitions happenHere’s another question about John McDonnell’s whizzy “inclusive ownership funds”, or IOFs. What happens when companies get taken over?Would employees see the money in practice? If McDonnell has developed rules to deal with takeover situations, he’s yet to share them. As with the £500-per-worker cap on annual idends, one can only speculate that his Treasury would demand the lion’s share when the pots of money become huge. Or perhaps, since only income from idends has been mentioned to date, employees would be denied takeover windfalls altogether. In that case, they would never really have owned the shares in the first place, either inidually or collectively.Definitive details of McDonnell’s proposal are promised in time. Let’s hope so, because the workers themselves would surely want to know if they would be quids in when acquisitions happen. Put another way, the IOF idea has not been thought through in detail. Best to get a more credible version on the table sharpish, which means a plan that does not dilute pension funds’ investments and is not seen as a tax grab.Employee share ownership is fertile ground for a popular policy, as McDonnell has correctly identified, and the Tories will surely be working on a rival scheme. Even amid their Brexit shambles, they will not find it hard to find a proposal that is more financially coherent.“Our aim is to give you all the tools, information and support you need to venture into the world of investing,” says the blurb on Hargreaves Lansdown’s website. Customers who hold shares in Unilever via the investment platform may beg to differ.Hargreaves’ email to Unilever shareholders, before the big “go Dutch” vote next month, omitted a crucial piece of information – the fact that, for their vote to count in the possibly crucial “majority in number” tally, private shareholders need to get their shares registered in certified form, in the jargon.The “majority in number” test, remember, is the poll in which each shareholder gets one vote, whether they own 100 shares or 100,000. It is different from the conventional vote that counts the pure numbers of shares.The certification problem is this: the 20,000 people who hold Unilever shares via Hargreaves fall under nominee arrangements. For the “majority in number” poll, they will be pooled within Hargreaves Nominees Ltd, which gets only one vote. But it’s easy to remove oneself from the pool by asking for a certified shareholding, albeit Hargreaves will charge a fee.So you would think Hargreaves would shout loudly about this important technical detail. After all, it’s supposed to be a champion of private investors and the Unilever vote is rare chance for small shareholders to make a difference. But the platform did not mention the voting wrinkle in its email. It just advertised its normal pooled voting service, which is ideal most of the time – just not on this occasion.Hargreaves agrees it failed to be explicit. For customers who feel aggrieved, it suggests buying a single certified share to get full bang for voting buck. That is good advice that should have been given earlier and explicitly.You can see some shocking pictures on the Daily Star website. For example, there’s evidence that at least some House of Fraser stores are now selling Sports Direct products – Lee Cooper belts, Adidas tracksuits and so on – complete with ugly Sports Direct Day-Glo stickers.Mike Ashley, after Sports Direct’s purchase of HoF out of administration, can run the business as he wishes, of course. One suspects shifting a lot of stock quickly was always part of his strategic plan as Christmas approaches. And those loyal HoF customers who pine for the pre-takeover “luxurious” image may recall that the old regime was not averse to holding a vulgar sale or two.But Ashley’s tactics suggest his vision for HoF to become “the Harrods of the high street” is not going to be realised quickly. Nobody, surely, expected it to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e594a92cff859245c9b5651bd7395c8a6e4a3897/0_184_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc4a3e084963c5b9f98e3a940ced5e61","title":"brett kavanaugh credibility devastating hearing","story":"The US supreme court nominee has badly stumbled just as he believed he was striding towards the highest court in the landThey say there are no heroes and no leaders left in Washington. Well one showed up in front of the Senate judiciary committee, and her name is Dr Christine Blasey Ford.Victims are supposed to be many things: suffering creatures who struggle to withstand the klieg lights of a court, or a hearing. Ford was something else entirely.Her pain was clear each time her voice cracked and her eyes welled with tears. But her courage, decency and honesty were even clearer as she walked carefully over ground she plainly never wanted to revisit from her teenage years.When Democratic senators were trying to score political points, she stuck to the facts as she remembered them, and the science behind why those memories are so vivid. When the Republican prosecutor was trying to poke holes in her credibility and memory, she offered her honest help in patiently answering an endless line of small-bore questions.The contrast with the US supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, could not have been greater. He was hot and bothered from the outset, fiddling with his shirt cuffs, sniffing incessantly, anxiously unscrewing small bottles of water, spraying accusations across the political landscape.He lapsed into his old role as a political hack, accusing a wide range of actors for his suffering: the media, the Democrats on the judiciary committee, a vast leftwing conspiracy, the Clintons. He predicted political Armageddon as sex was weaponized to destroy reputations, notably his own, as he was just on the verge of success.“For decades to come I fear the country will reap the whirlwind,” he declared. “When I did at least OK enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.”As a federal appeals court judge, Kavanaugh’s performance was jarringly unbalanced and at times unhinged.As a former staffer to Ken Starr, the man who investigated Bill Clinton’s sexual scandals in excruciating and public detail, Kavanaugh seemed oblivious to his part in the very whirlwind that swept him up.Republicans had two ways to defend Kavanaugh. One boiled down to mistaken identity: Ford was assaulted, but she couldn’t be sure by who. The other revolved around arcane process questions about committee letters and staffers, senators and protocol. The extended debate about process made the Republican chairman Chuck Grassley sound like the grumpy, batty octogenarian he really is.But the questions about mistaken identity prompted two answers that were as explosive as they were definitive.Ford was asked about her strongest memory of the assault. The response was deeply moving to anyone with a living, beating heart. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter, and their having fun at my expense,” Ford said, as she turned her eyes down to her lap. “I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another.”Another senator asked Ford what was her degree of certainty about being assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh.In the silence that followed, you could hear Republicans gasping for air as they calculated the political cost of this nomination. What was larger? The number of votes they were losing among women versus the number of votes they would lose among Trump fanatics by putting this flatlining nomination out of its misery.Senate hearings are political theater: a strange spectacle with legal trappings designed to showcase the leading actors, the senators themselves. So it was doubly strange to see one half of the actors step off stage and surrender their time to a career prosecutor.They wanted to avoid the scene of a group of men badgering a woman about sexual assault. Sure enough, they managed to avoid looking like they were staging a witch trial. But by choosing silence they looked worse: like cowards.While Democratic senators could express sympathy for Ford and the searing memories of her sexual assault, their Republican counterparts gave their time to a technical deposition. The questions by Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, were cold and calculating.At best the questions were tone deaf. At worst they were uncaring and self-defeating. Far from undermining the credibility of Ford, the prosecutor made the professor look more credible, more human, and more sympathetic.The same could not be said for the prosecutor’s questions of Kavanaugh. The more he was grilled about sex and alcohol, the worse he sounded. Did he drink to the point where he blacked out, or woke up in a different place, or found his clothes somewhere else? The questions themselves were tarnishing Kavanaugh even as they were intended to clear him.“We drank beer. And sometimes we probably had too many beers,” Kavanaugh said, clinging to the only talking point that made him seem comfortable. “We drank beer. We liked beer.”Did he drink too many beers?“What are too many beers? I don’t know,” he said, seeming totally unprepared to talk about his favorite subject. “Whatever the chart says. The blood alcohol chart.”The Republican senators soon abandoned the prosecutor and her pesky questions about penis-waving and gang rape, resorting instead to angry finger-wagging and complaints about the Democrats.Aside from his impassioned denials, Kavanaugh’s defense hinged on one claim: that Ford’s friend, Leland Ingham Keyser, didn’t recall the party or Kavanaugh. The judge claimed that meant Ford’s accusations were not just uncorroborated but refuted. But they weren’t refuted, and Keyser also said she believed her friend.In any case, the judge himself undermined Keyser’s blanket amnesia when he said that actually he knew her, probably at high school.It was a pattern repeated throughout Kavanaugh’s many angry outbursts and interruptions. He claimed he had no calendar record of the party in question, so it didn’t take place. He even claimed he never attended any gathering of that kind.But he also said he liked hanging out with his friends, drinking beers and talking about girls. Which sounded remarkably like the night Ford described.For a guy who claimed to have busted his butt on his academics, it wasn’t clear that Kavanaugh busted his butt preparing for a hearing that will define his career and reputation. He had no coherent response for why he couldn’t support an FBI investigation into Ford’s account.When asked what he personally thought about an investigation, Kavanaugh sat in silence before blurting out something about the FBI not coming to conclusions.Instead, Kavanaugh interrupted Democratic senators to press them on whether they liked to drink, and what they liked to drink. He teared up at strange moments, about his yearbook, his calendars and his workouts with his football buddies.The longer the questioning went on, the more he interrupted, the more evasive he sounded. He claimed his yearbook references to throwing up was just because of his weak stomach. It could have been spicy food, or could have been beer. Either way, he really loved beer and still does.Kavanaugh’s nomination may, or may not, survive the Senate hearing on Thursday. But his credibility, testifying under oath for a lifetime job on the highest court in the land, did not.Brett Kavanaugh’s former boss might have put it best. “You cannot defile the temple of justice,” Ken Starr intoned to reporters as he was carrying out the trash from his home.That was back in the late 1990s, when Kavanaugh was, um, defiling the temple of justice by leaking confidential tidbits to those same reporters on behalf of Starr.Two decades later, he and his Republican senator friends were shocked (shocked!) that confidential tidbits were getting leaked to reporters. The media was outrageously misreading his yearbook to concoct references to sex and beer. It was a sham, a con, that couldn’t possibly be subject to an FBI investigation because the Democrats were so political.Nobody should suffer the public whirlwind that has swept up two families, the Fords and the Kavanaughs. No senators should bluster and rage when considering a supreme court nominee.But more than anyone else in Washington, Brett Kavanaugh should know that he stumbled badly just as he believed he was striding towards his rightful place on the supreme court. You cannot defile the temple of justice when you want your own seat in the inner sanctum of the high temple itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c70b45e5074ac25337c8a06d3907b8649cf61072/39_166_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4c553c3bcc225b6eff4ffd3f21069d","title":"students british booze drinking young people","story":"The kids were plastered, cheerfully and unashamedly the kind of giggly, rolling drunk where you’re holding each other up in the street, alternating between bursting into horribly off-key song and exaggeratedly shushing each other. There was no malice to them, so watching them from across the street in Liverpool as I trudged home from Labour party conference one evening just made me feel nostalgic. Freshers’ week obviously hasn’t changed, then.And yet in some respects it has. Booze will always be part of it – the British still can’t easily talk to strangers, especially strangers of the opposite sex, without being a few sheets to the wind – but universities are now casting around for freshers’ week events that don’t just involve bar crawls and they’re doing it by popular demand, not from a nannying desire to ruin all the fun (although doubtless it goes some way to reducing town versus gown tensions). At Durham last year, there was a day trip to a petting zoo for those who’d rather not meet fellow freshers while throwing up in the gutter. Others are laying on yoga classes. Listening this week to someone from Newcastle University explaining to a faintly incredulous radio interviewer that not all students want to drink, I remembered the girl on the edge of that cheerfully hammered group in Liverpool the one who didn’t seem as drunk as the others, who looked as if she was resignedly going along with it.Compulsory sobriety when you’re longing for a quick sharpener is – let’s be honest – no fun, especially if everyone else is going at it hammer and tongs. The most miserable party conference season of my life was the one spent in the secretive first few months of pregnancy everything that happens after sundown in politics tends to involve bad white wine, and since it was too early to explain why I wasn’t drinking, that meant weeks of surreptitiously emptying glasses into plant pots or mumbling about antibiotics. But compulsory boozing when you’d frankly rather have an early night, or simply feel more in control around people you don’t know all that well, is no better.Once upon a time, booze was the petrol on which many industries ran. When I started out on Fleet Street, the older reporters would talk wistfully about how the golden years were over they missed the epic lost afternoons, the warm beery camaraderie of meeting contacts in the pub and the genial blurring of business with pleasure. (One paper famously had a bar in the building, reasoning that at least it would know where to find reporters in an emergency.)That culture lingered on in Westminster. The “two-bottle lunch” was a favoured ritual for certain Labour spin doctors when I first joined the lobby, and while at first it seemed thrillingly decadent compared with being stuck at a desk, I came to slightly dread them. Don’t get me wrong – after work, with friends, I was as happy as any other twentysomething to get paralytic. But doing it in the middle of the working day with people I barely knew felt frankly weird. It’s one thing when both lunchers are middle-aged men with livers hardened by years of doing exactly this, who can seemingly roll back to the office none the worse for wear. I couldn’t match them glass for glass without wanting to spend much of the afternoon lying down groaning, and my deadlines didn’t allow for that. But it felt prissy and uptight to refuse, because that was just how it was, and not only in newspapers. When Lloyd’s of London banned lunchtime drinking last year, in a rather killjoy memo arguing that a zero alcohol limit was more “in line with the modern, global and high performance culture that we want to embrace”, there was an outcry from middle-aged professionals at this assault on the freedom to get hammered.If the culture of drinking at work is changing, it’s doing so because the nature of those in work is changing. What saved me from one thumping mid-afternoon headache too many was the influx of women MPs, so many of whom just wanted to drink fizzy water and give you a brisk rundown of the gossip before getting back to their desks. Now it’s the influx of Generation Sensible, millennials who tend to deal with their stress in the gym not at the bar, that’s changing corporate culture. Only one in 10 see it as cool to brag about getting drunk, according to one survey (doing so was seen as “belonging to the older generation”). That doesn’t mean they’re not sometimes getting drunk, as anyone who has been inside a bar – or indeed a party conference – lately will have noticed. Half of under-24s had drunk alcohol in the previous week, according to the Office for National Statistics.But two decades ago the figure would have been four out of five, which suggests young people are now more relaxed about taking or leaving it. To the relief of anyone who for medical or cultural reasons isn’t getting sloshed and doesn’t feel like constantly explaining why, the stigma of not drinking may be wearing off. Personally, I’ve got no intention of going on the wagon. But a world where people are neither slut-shamed out of drinking, nor bullied into it? I’ll raise a glass to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b988da59658074134c07e00c0567d50fd8b25e6/6_406_5426_3257/master/5426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d9acad019cdb1df7e9b3deebd2079c","title":"the guardian view on big data and insurance knowing too much","story":"Is it reasonable for life insurance companies to demand that their customers try to get fit? Reasonable or not, it is already happening. John Hancock, one of the oldest life insurance companies in the US, announced last week that it would in future only write policies that offer rewards for customers who use various forms of fitness trackers or join gyms. Similar offers are available in Britain, where 1.1 million people have signed up to such schemes. It is entirely sensible that people who take out health insurance should also try to become healthier. But if the process is carried to extremes, it could undermine one of the fundamental principles of any insurance market.Insurance works because we are ignorant of our inidual fates. It is the fact that any of us might turn out to be a bad risk that makes it sensible for everyone to insure against that remote chance. The pooling of inidual risks that can only be known in aggregate underlies the whole system. But there is a subtle mismatch of aims between insurers and their customers. The customers want to avoid the consequences of misfortune the insurers want customers who avoid misfortune. The two aims are reconciled because both sides are operating behind a veil of ignorance.Insurers have an interest in knowing as much as possible about their customers. Customers have an interest in insurers underestimating their real risk. But there is a further complication. Each inidual customer also has an interest in the insurers pricing all the others accurately, with the help of as much information as possible. And both sides will benefit if ways are found to reduce the risk of the misfortune insured against. Fireproofing houses is good for both sides of the home insurance business. Giving up smoking is good for both sides of the life insurance business. The balance between knowledge and ignorance of risk has traditionally been struck at the level of statistical knowledge about large groups. Take motor insurance: women used to get cheaper car insurance because they crash less and drive better than men. Young drivers pay far more than old ones, for the same kind of reasons.But statistically significant groups are getting smaller in the age of big data. In the US, one data company uses 442 non-medical attributes to predict medical costs and so which clients are profitable to insure. In the light of the health disparities between the rich and poor areas of Britain, private insurers could do the same here with no more information than a postcode. This is why the NHS has to cover everyone, if it is to work as it should. The risks must be shared between healthy and unhealthy, rich and poor. No one must be left out of the pool. Offering rewards for healthy behaviour benefits all of society. But penalising unhealthy behaviour with worse or less insurance injures those who really need protection. Given the correlation between unhealthy lifestyles and lower incomes, the risks are only too clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e0729f43e420af39344493ce1aaba99e07171f3/0_39_3018_1810/master/3018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce0fd446586eeadd62a02e752ffda0f9","title":"tories petrified jeremy corbyn rightwing press labour party conference","story":"If Jeremy Corbyn ever allows himself a glance at the detested MSM, the mainstream media, then he should be pleased today. Of course the overwhelmingly Tory press, owned by a handful of zillionaires, hates everything he stands for. Of course they slam him all over the place – especially for promising to implement David Cameron’s Leveson 2 to give citizens legal protection from the media’s worst intrusions.But see how almost every rightwing editorial and commentator warns the Tories that Labour has the high ground in ideas, dynamism and popular appeal. Corbynism is shifting the ground beneath the Tories’ feet and they sound knee-knocking scared.First, here’s the ritual punch-bagging. The ’s leader writhes furiously: “Entrepreneurs would leave the country or close down their businesses and put thousands out of work … Yes, everyone will be equal, equally poor. We know this because wherever Mr Corbyn’s brand of socialism has been tried, calamity has been the result. Look at Venezuela …” Corbyn would threaten the fundamentals of liberal democracy itself, says Theresa May’s former adviser Nick Timothy in the same paper, ending ominously: “We cannot say we have not been warned.”“Labour would ruin us all” is the Express’s editorial headline. The Mail’s leader says, “As any realist can see, his programme of Marxist economics, class warfare and unfettered union power is a recipe for mass unemployment and national ruin.” The Times leader agrees: “Judged by any reasonable outsider it was not a prospectus for government but for economic disaster.”There’s plenty more of this, with gleeful reporting of red-meat outre conference moments – MP Laura Smith’s call for a general strike against democracy, cheered on by the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler’s batty praise for the days of Liverpool’s Militant regime, and so on. So much, so routine.But read beyond the headlines and every one of these rightwing leader-writers says the same thing: Tories, beware! This Corbyn stuff is political magic that may fool the unwary voter. Here’s the Mail: “It is simply not enough for Tories to point out the truth that Mr Corbyn’s policies are disastrous or that he’s surrounded by antisemites and sympathisers with anti-western terrorists … No, at their conference next week the Tories need to set out their own solutions to the grievances Mr Corbyn has identified. They must find positive language to convince the country that under them the future for all will be bright. After this week’s display of far-left lunacy in Liverpool, the stakes couldn’t be higher.”The FT’s Sebastian Payne writes: “Only a new economic agenda can save the Conservatives.” The Times leader ends, “In the battle for ideas between the two main parties, the quality is low but Mr Corbyn is right that he is winning … It should not be hard to make a case for grown-up government, Mrs May is just making it look much harder.” Their stablemate The Sun warns the same: “If the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.” The  leader warns that Corbyn’s speech ended on “a triumphalist note that the Tories urgently need to silence with a plan of their own.”The message, loud and clear, is that May’s government is running on empty, Brexit has sucked the air out everything, and it is as short of inspiration as John Major’s comical conference speech where his response to crashing out of the ERM was a motorway cones hotline. These Tory commentators can all feel the seismic quake of the centre ground lurching away from Margaret Thatcher’s certainty that lower taxes and a smaller state is where elections are won. They are blindsided by finding her policies rejected because they have failed.The ideological icons of her era have tumbled down, of their own accord. Renationalising the utilities she snatched from public ownership has the backing of a public scandalised by their privatised boards’ behaviour. Her “Tell Sid” share-owning democracy never happened, but Corbyn’s might. Her right-to-buy sold off huge numbers of council homes, many of which are now owned by rack-renting landlords charging inflated rents – and the bill is picked up by the taxpayer through housing benefit, amid a housing crisis. Home ownership has fallen not risen. What on earth can they find – fast – to replace their lost faith?But something else is also at work today, not a noble search for new directions but a familiar dig at their own hated leader. They use Corbyn’s cornucopia of new thinking as a stick to beat May in their continuing fratricidal internal warfare over Brexit. Quentin Letts’ long leader-page piece says it all. Once he has ritually knocked Labour about a bit, he warns they might win – and May is to blame. But the lesson he wants his party to learn is to double down on all the policies the public is moving away from. “Imagine if the Tories started speaking of liberty, of tax-cutting, of proper defence spending, of cutting the foreign aid budget by two-thirds and getting us cleanly out of the EU, no strings, no caveats. And imagine if they did it with a sense of joy. Impossible under Theresa May? If so, find someone more charismatic.”Well, bring it on. If the only lesson they can learn is that the country is in need of more of the same, Labour will have a clear run whenever the next election comes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bfbf78015475f8dfb32a692f49cfdfed8c90055/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8addef59ee32f30d58ceb0f1a4cd5c51","title":"what christine blasey ford reveals about womanhood","story":"Extraordinarily competent but also modest, polite and visibly nervous in the face of male authority: Dr Ford was a palatable vision of being a womanDr Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before the Senate judiciary committee was emotional. Her voice cracked, and more than once she seemed to be holding back tears. Wearing a blue suit, as Anita Hill did when she testified before that same committee in 1991 – before three of the same male Republican senators – her eyes were magnified by a pair of large glasses. She looked terrified even before she said she was.In a tellingly feminine posture, she seemed eager to accommodate and to please, even before the Republican senators whose objective at the hearing was to discredit her. She repeatedly stated that she wanted to be helpful, offered to do whatever would be helpful, expressed wishes that she could be more helpful. She repeatedly apologized for not being able to provide pieces of information to the committee – information that often could have been provided by Mark Judge, or any of the other witnesses that Republicans refuse to allow to testify. At the beginning of the hearing, in an apparent attempt to ease the mood, she made a small joke about needing a cup of coffee. She laughed nervously when Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the committee, replied that no one made his coffee right.Ford’s vulnerability was contrasted with her competence. She calmly responded to repetitive factual queries, even when the lines of questioning by Rachel Mitchell, the female prosecutor hired by Republicans to put a gentle, feminine sheen on their skepticism toward Ford, veered into the insulting and preposterous.Ford answered questions about whether she had been sufficiently traumatized by her assault, about who paid for the polygraph test that she passed and about whether she was really afraid of flying. Ford, who holds a psychology PhD, effectively served as an expert witness on the psychological impact of her own assault, and provided a remedial education to the senators on the committee in brain chemistry, memory formation and trauma response.Crucially, Ford is white. As the preliminary comparisons to Hill’s testimony emerged, many commented on how Ford’s nervous vulnerability contrasted with Hill’s self-possession, poise and palpable irritation at the condescending and contemptuous treatment that she received from members of the judiciary committee. Ford does not face the double bind that Hill did of navigating the racist and sexist attitudes of her interrogators and the public at the same time.As a white woman, Ford has access to wells of public sympathy that Hill did not. Ours is still a world, as it was in 1991, in which black women’s vulnerability is read as a sign not of credibility but of a lack of intelligence where their competence is read not as a mark of professional achievement but as coldness or pretension and where they are met, from the time they are very young girls, with a culture that assumes them to be hypersexual and undeserving of protection. It is yet to be seen whether Ford’s testimony will be more politically impactful than Hill’s was. If it is, the specific forms of racist misogyny that punish black women will be part of why.Before Ford’s testimony was even over, reports emerged that conservatives were distressed by how credible and sympathetic she appeared. The Fox News host Chris Wallace declared her testimony a “disaster” for the Republicans. Part of why Ford seemed so credible and so empathetic was that she seemed to embody a very popular performance of femininity. Extraordinarily competent but also modest, deferential, solicitous, polite and visibly nervous in the face of male authority, Ford was a vision of womanhood that our culture finds more palatable than the angry, strident or frustrated affect that the #MeToo movement has sometimes been characterized as having.It is crucial that Ford never seemed angry. Even when the questions that Mitchell parlayed to her from the Republican senators were convoluted, condescending or ridiculous, she expressed at most a kind of accommodating confusion – never irritation, exhaustion or impatience. This was strategically smart: women’s anger is still frequently punished, ridiculed or taken as a sign of their lack of credibility.But political wisdom of this stance undercuts the fact that rage, for Ford, would be an entirely justified emotion. The man she says assaulted her is poised to become one of the most powerful people in the nation, poised to gain the power that Republicans hope he will use to take a different kind of bodily autonomy from millions of women. In hopes that it won’t be he who does this, she has had to make a spectacle of her pain for national consumption, with the full understanding that many of the senators witnessing her pain would vote to confirm Kavanaugh anyway. It would be reasonable for her to yell – and it speaks volumes that she didn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42dfff2a8c9abc23a25be8e271c02968be3b36d9/0_3_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3045d1e0010063a7039379e4dcf0df9d 465w","title":"eye on the tiger the worlds largest ever exhibition of tiger photography in pictures","story":"London show brings together powerful and moving images from the world’s top wildlife photographers to raise awareness of the plight of these critically endangered cats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd43b2502c0e965f1d4aef1089ce060688a87f6a/1_2_2556_1534/master/2556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2a81f559929a40c4bd2f4abc0c2e551","title":"memories of summer linger in chloes paris catwalk show","story":"Natacha Ramsay-Levi combines Ibiza beach market fashions with city sensibilityMuch like the temperatures in Paris this week, Chloé’s creative director, Natacha Ramsay-Levi, was determined to keep attendees in a midsummer mood at the French fashion house’s show on Thursday.Entitled Hippy Modernism, the collection was about incorporating memories of summer with a back-to-work wardrobe. “I was thinking about the woman who cares about nature and takes souvenirs from summertime back to the city,” the designer said, adding that she wanted to be literal while also capturing a new-age energy.This presented itself in a collection of prints, patterns and pieces you might find in a beach market in Ibiza but which were given a city sensibility by being worked into softly structured silhouettes and styled with city-approved accessories. Clashing scarf prints were realised in tailored jumpsuits, palazzo trousers, A-line skirts and handkerchief tops, while bright embroidered jacquard and tasselled carpet fabrics were cut into blazers, dresses and miniskirts.Where looks threatened to wander into backpacker waters, they were pulled back to the boulevards of the French capital with decadent diamanté drop earrings and shiny gold bangles, which formed Ramsay-Levi’s largest jewellery offering to date. Polish also came care of smart Marcie bags, the house’s bestseller which was updated in croc-embossed leather this season to mark its 10th anniversary.Several outfits came decorated with beachcombed details – a prevailing trend at the New York and London shows also – such as a boxy trouser suit with adornments resembling sandy-hued shells and pebbles attached to the collar and placket, as well as rope belts – another detail proving popular with designers for next summer.Ramsay-Levi, who joined the house from a senior design role at Louis Vuitton last year, spoke of going back to things that are simple and grounded, explaining that these details were about “taking something which is prosaic and making it something that is sophisticated” – a micro-analogy for the wider concept of idealism she sought to explore and redefine.There were beautiful pieces in this collection, such as the crinkled long-sleeve jackets made from plissé mousseline, a fabric also used for the series of flowing evening dresses that closed the show and which Ramsay-Levi said were inspired by Greek goddesses. There were also items that will define this season, specifically the multicoloured T-shirts featuring a motif of two hands forming the heart shape around a Balearic sunset – the chosen design for the show invitation and messaging around the venue.At Chloé, Ramsay-Levi follows in the footsteps of Phoebe Philo, Stella McCartney and most recently Clare Waight Keller – three successful British female designers who, despite their different approaches, all kept the house’s signature elevated bohemia a constant throughout their tenures, to critical acclaim. With only three ready-to-wear collections for the house now under Paris native Ramsay-Levi’s belt, and the first of her collections becoming available this spring, it is too early for Chloé owners Richemont to know the impression that her take on the aesthetic has had on finances. The fashion, however, is looking solid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/403e9f63685e5af6da0f717130f3f9fb87264cea/0_112_6625_3975/master/6625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efafd59e37ea27bbef0dab159da87131","title":"all aboard why the houseboat is making waves on the big screen","story":"As living on the water increases in popularity, movies have seized on this unconventional way of life to make a point about freedom and choicesThe houseboat seems like an artefact that’s as British as tea and crumpets – a colourful, quaint behemoth ploughing through the sludgy waters of the country’s canals and waterways. In a turbulent housing market, more people are now turning to “continuous cruising” as a viable way of living – especially in the capital. According to the Canal \u0026amp River Trust, there are more than 34,000 licensed boats in the UK today, with more than a third of owners saying their boat’s primary purpose was as a full-time residence or second home.British cinema has embraced the houseboat and its symbolic value, in conjunction with its surge in real-world popularity. This year, a handful of movies have used this unconventional way of life as part of a character’s story – and to make a point about contemporary society.The drama Anchor and Hope, from Spanish director Carlos Marques-Marcet, sees Game of Thrones alumni Natalia Tena and Oona Chaplin as lesbian couple Kat and Eva, grappling with the notion of whether to have a child, while living on a boat that travels along the canals of London. Eva is determined to become a parent, and suggests Kat’s friend as a potential sperm donor, while Kat sees the prospect of bringing a child into their cramped environment as a “selfish” indulgence. It becomes clear through the course of the narrative that Eva adopted the houseboat way of living as a result of her relationship with Kat – a boat enthusiast who repairs them as a part-time job. For Kat, the boat is a symbol of a freewheeling, shackle-free lifestyle whereas, for Eva, it’s the titular anchor holding her and their relationship down, preventing any progress from taking place. These characters are in the same boat, as it were, but it means very different things to each of them.The houseboat movie trend continues in November with the release of the intriguing drama Tides, which follows four friends who meet for a reunion on a narrowboat. Written and improvised in a collaborative effort by the cast over the course of a few days, it uses the confined, isolated environment as a crucible to amplify the emotions of the characters.This duality of the houseboat as a symbol also plays into some of its other appearances this year. Comedy Swimming With Men portrays the houseboat occupied by Rupert Graves’s middle-aged professional as a sad symbol of his isolated, bachelor lifestyle. When he invites Rob Brydon’s character to stay, he looks mournfully at a photo of his kids and admits that he left their mother for a doomed relationship with a younger woman, suggesting that the boat is a miserable compromise for him as a result of bad life choices.On the opposite – and more pleasant – side of the equation, grey pound romcom Finding Your Feet concludes with a standard last-minute dash, as Imelda Staunton’s protagonist leaves her life of home counties comfort to live with Timothy Spall on his houseboat. For her, the boat and its untethered existence provide the perfect opportunity for her to escape her love-rat husband and her bland, middle-class life. Escape is also represented by a houseboat in the British romcom Patrick. The course of this particular story sees Beattie Edmondson’s permanently exhausted protagonist handed the opportunity to ditch her demanding landlord and pokey flat in order to embrace the freedom of life aboard her own houseboat. In a story that delights in piling as much suffering on Edmondson as possible, the prospect of a life on the water offers a rare oasis of escapism for her. It’s a scenario familiar to many of the new millennial cruisers.The prominence of the houseboat in so many British movies also underlines its changing role in society. Once, it was a symbol of quaint holidaying for the elderly. In a 2007 episode of the sitcom Peep Show, a canal boat provided a venue for the squarest stag do in history and proved to be an emblem for the affluent, middle-class lifestyle craved by David Mitchell’s character.A decade later, however, the narrowboat has become a viable housing choice for cash-strapped millennials spooked by gargantuan house prices. For couples like Kat and Eva in Anchor and Hope, the houseboat might be the only way they can secure a home in the capital, and a symbol of an attractive, bohemian lifestyle. For film-makers, the boat has become a malleable symbol capable of saying all manner of different things about the troubled waters of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6b2400b2e43d93311ad541c0969956fa23d99c2/0_210_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754fd793550fc5ec03b3b1c3946d6da7","title":"how to avoid food waste top chefs on their grandparents favourite dishes and what they taught them","story":"Angela Hartnett, Fergus Henderson, Raymond Blanc and many others describe the frugal simplicity - and delicious flavours - that inspire their cooking todayYet among many chefs and campaigning food writers, the sense persists that on a number of issues – particularly food waste, but also obesity, nutrition, cost, pleasure even – there is much to admire in how our grandparents ate. In an era of limited choice and tight budgets, they made a virtue of the necessity to cook with whatever fresh ingredients were available. “My grandparents didn’t cook ‘sustainably’, but they did cook every day, one of life’s best skills, and they didn’t throw leftovers away. To that extent, they were thrifty,” says Tom Hunt, the self-styled eco-chef and  columnist.To examine that idea, we asked a number of top chefs to choose a meal that encapsulates how their grandparents cooked and to explain how, in its frugal simplicity, it still influences them. Call it going back to the future.“Originally from Bardi in Italy, my grandmother never wasted a thing in the kitchen. It was incredible. Any leftovers went into bowls covered with a saucer she didn’t believe in clingfilm. For her minestrone, she’d use bones from a roast to make stock and any old veg, dried beans and parmesan rinds would go in. These days, people look at sell-by dates and bin stuff when there’s no need. I freeze anything I can re-use and then I’ll invite the neighbours over for a freezer-party.”Liver and onions“I’m 48. As a kid in Bury, offal was commonplace. I loved watching my gran make flash-fried liver with onion gravy and mashed potato. It’s a 20-minute meal. Faggots, made of minced heart, liver and lung, were a school dinner favourite. I’d eat whatever was put on the table. If you didn’t, there was nothing else. Today, I know friends who’ll cook three different meals for three different kids. It’s crazy.”“I was six when I started helping my gran in the kitchen. It was just expected that us girls would cook. At weekends, we’d help out in the Sikh temple kitchens feeding the community and – using this big burner at my dad’s in Chapeltown – we’d cook huge batch curries and daals. Daal is such a heart-warming dish: simple, cheap, beautiful. We’d give this food to friends or use it for family weddings. This was before people used caterers. We’d chop hundreds of onions, but there was no waste. Any spare vegetables or lemon and lime skins we’d pickle or make into chutney, and that’s how I run my kitchen.”“I grew up in the Franche-Comté, in a village between Burgundy and the Jura mountains. Money was tight, but my grandmother was an extraordinary cook who passed that knowledge on to my mum, who taught me to do a lot with very little. She always used seasonal vegetables from our garden or the forest, where we foraged for berries, mushrooms and wild asparagus. My mother had five children and used a lot of pulses and cheese – meat was a special treat. A simple, cheesy comté soufflé was a staple on our table. It encapsulates my region.”“My dad’s mum had a roadside cafe in Ingleton called the Three Peaks and what struck me about Nana was that she never used recipes. It was all instinct. Both her and my mum used whatever they had in, cooking sustainably without being aware of it. My mum makes an amazing cottage pie using, as she says, ‘everything from the top shelf’. It’s the same base, but she adds whatever she has in the fridge. With one-pots and cottage pies you can play around, substituting ingredients so nothing is wasted.”“I fondly remember picking fruit with my gran, Minnie, in her garden in Sheffield: wild strawberries, jewel-like currants, raspberries, hedgerow blackberries. She’d make jam or use the leftovers for cordial – my gran was naturally thrifty – but the most fragrant fruit would be reserved for summer pudding. Put the fruit in a pan with some sugar and the odd tart gooseberry and it yields this beautiful glossy purple juice. Soak up the juice with some slightly stale bread and layer that up with fruit in a pudding basin. Serve with double cream.”Chicken and rice“My gran, Mamita Naty, lived in a small Andean village, 18 hours by bus from Lima. She was a farmer and a cook whose house doubled as a restaurant. In the Andes, the food tradition is farm-to-table, nose-to-tail, organic, zero waste. It’s not a fad. It’s been that way for hundreds of years and, in my restaurants, we’re very resourceful. Take the Peruvian classic arroz con pollo, which is like coriander chicken paella. We get the whole chicken and use the offal in a separate devilled, stir-fried dish, we use the meat for the main and then we cook the carcass with leftover pea pods, herb stems, pepper and onion ends to make an exquisite broth. In a way, that chicken and rice turns into three dishes.”“In the 90s, we’d visit my elderly uncle and auntie Nishimura in Kyoto each summer. There were no snacks or packaged drinks in the house and we always took packed lunches on day trips. It’s just what people of their generation did. An evening meal would be broth, rice, a small piece of fish or cold octopus, home-fermented tsukemono pickles and maybe cooked vegetables. Giant frozen grapes were a big treat for dessert. Any leftovers would go into uncle’s lunch next day, made into onigiri rice balls or a bento. I take a similar approach at the Black Bull. We buy in whole animals and use everything.”“The second world war and rationing killed food culture for my grandparents’ generation. But they could cook. There was less processed, convenience food and you had to produce meals from real ingredients. My grandmother wasn’t a great cook, but she used to make a thickened white chicken stew – I don’t know if she knew the fancy French name for it, but like a blanquette de poulet – and I still totally love simple, comforting one-pot stews.”Bacon ribs and cabbageTripe and onions“I don’t really have culinary memories of my granny, who died when I was young, but my mum, who was born in Bolton, used to cook us tripe and onions in milk with mashed potato. It’s a wonderfully calming dish that uplifts the spirits. Bleached tripe was widely available in London in the 60s and 70s, but we use brown, unbleached tripe in the restaurant. We pickle it or slow-braise it. A few boys still come in and ask: ‘What’s the scariest thing on the menu?’, which is all wrong. Offal is not scary. It’s delicious.”“I don’t want to use the word ‘foraging’, but in the early 90s, in my grandparents’ village outside York, it was normal to walk the dogs whilst gathering mushrooms for Sunday lunch or brambles for a pie. We ate a lot of game, too – whatever was at hand in that rural area. As many people in Yorkshire do, we’d eat our Yorkshire pudding and gravy first, as a starter. Historically, it was a ‘filler’ and, by eating that way, people could reduce the cost of a three-course meal. That upbringing made me appreciate you can create restaurant dishes and extract deliciousness from humble ingredients. It doesn’t have to be all fillet of beef and caviar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04296dc45c88b80a9dc7f34366b40cf8d0c3e3ac/0_409_6839_4104/master/6839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e8b44211927188e06afb03f1e12e270","title":"jamie olivers business empire to post 20m loss this year","story":"Troubled times for high-street dining to blame says company after the celebrity chef forced to bail out his brandJamie Oliver’s business empire slumped to a loss of nearly £20m last year, dragged down by a grim year at his restaurant chain which was forced to close a dozen outlets in February.The company said it had suffered from the “ongoing challenges of the casual dining sector”, which has resulted in a series of well-known restaurant chains, including Carluccio’s and Byron, closing outlets after over-enthusiastic expansion followed by significant increases in costs, particularly rent and labour.The fall into the red highlights a difficult year for the celebrity chef, who also had to close one of his two flagship Barbecoa restaurants in London.Yet Oliver, who got his big break when a visiting TV crew spotted him working at the River Cafe in Hammersmith, which led to his own show The Naked Chef, still paid himself idends of more than £6m during the year, according to accounts set to be filed at Companies House this week.The celebrity chef and entrepreneur has said he does not fully understand why his restaurant business ran into financial trouble, but Jon Knight, who now heads the restaurant element of Oliver’s business, has said the chain became complacent and lost touch with the principles of its founder.Oliver, a high-profile campaigner on childhood obesity and animal welfare, recently shocked fans by becoming the face of Tesco.The strong media performance was driven by the success of Oliver’s 5 Ingredients, Quick \u0026amp Easy book, which sold a million copies in the UK alone last year. The accompanying TV series, Jamie’s Quick and Easy Food, was sold in to 121 territories.Paul Hunt, chief executive of Jamie Oliver Group, said: “The success of our media business, driven by the stellar performance of 5 Ingredients, Quick \u0026amp Easy Food, was fundamental to our ability to support the restaurant business and ensure its continuity.“With a reshaped restaurant estate, a new management team, and a focused investment plan backed by HSBC, we are making steady headway in a challenging market.”In 2015, Oliver shut the last branch of Recipease – his chain of cookery shops – and the last of his four British-themed Union Jacks restaurants went the same way two years later. His food magazine, Jamie, ceased publication after almost 10 years last October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9495f963b095c6b0462b2f4e4a90b24727608a8b/302_275_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71476b9f918e6780a9420d749f8ce78","title":"paul pogba agent manchester united talks jose mourinho mino raiola","story":"• Mino Raiola wants to see club’s view on sale and on Mourinho• Relationship between Pogba and Mourinho at an all-time lowPaul Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, is set to meet Manchester United officials in November to discuss the midfielder’s future. The player’s relationship with José Mourinho reached an all-time low this week when he was stripped of the vice-captaincy and the pair were involved in a frosty exchange at the training ground on Wednesday.Pogba has been at United since rejoining from Juventus for a then world-record fee of £89m in 2016 and Raiola wants to meet the club to establish whether they would be willing to let his client go in January or next summer. The agent also wants to wait until November to see whether Mourinho is still the manager.United did not contemplate selling Pogba last summer when Barcelona made an offer of £45m plus the players Yerry Mina and André Gomes, while Juventus did not bid because United told them there was no point.However, matters have escalated in recent weeks, with Pogba criticising the team’s style of play, saying they should “attack, attack, attack”, especially at home, and Mourinho taking umbrage at the player posting an Instagram video of himself in a jovial mood on the night of the Carabao Cup defeat against Derby County.Pogba, who has a contract until 2021, claims to be happy in England, happy that he is at United at this point of his career and happy with his teammates. The fact that his relationship with the manager is so poor, however, means he is open to a move.Raiola, in his meeting with United, wants to establish whether the club will keep backing Mourinho even if results and the general atmosphere around the club do not improve – and if that is the case he will start to look for ways out for the France midfielder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d3c2b3bdb832b33042f3823aa546a3078828558/0_145_6640_3984/master/6640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b9f6c957f118849118878e4fb0a6545","title":"seema jaswal presenter interview world cup premier league","story":"The idea that there might be barriers in her way did not occur to Seema Jaswal until, soon after deciding that a role in front of the cameras was the ideal way forward, a chance conversation arose with her family’s neighbour. “She’s an older lady, a lovely person who had seen me grow up,” she says. “When I told her I wanted to be on television she said: ‘Seema, things like that don’t happen to people like us.’ And I remember thinking: ‘But why?’”Jaswal has spent the subsequent decade proving that statement wrong. She is a familiar face to millions, hosting Premier League Productions’ worldwide coverage of the English top flight and covering a range of sports across most of the major domestic channels. She was a roving reporter for ITV’s World Cup team in Russia, vox-popping around host cities at one stroke and mediating pundits’ pitchside discussions the next football is her focus and she is acutely aware that, as a woman of Asian heritage in her early 30s, she is beating a path that has not always been open to those before her.Nowadays Jaswal hears female voices in her earpiece as she prepares to broadcast, and sees women’s faces among the sound assistants and camera operators behind the scenes. It has not always been like that, she says, during a career whose profile has risen sharply in the last two years. She was “a shy little girl” during her early years growing up in west London and, even while studying for a degree in sociology and politics at Royal Holloway University, took time in committing to a particular path. With the confidence of increased maturity came the idea that television, preferably drawing upon her lifelong love for sport, might not be unrealistic after a stint at Sky Sports she got her big break with CBBC’s Sportsround show.“I think sport played a big role in making me more confident,” she says. Jaswal’s maternal grandfather was a successful tennis player in Uganda she grew up with “tennis in my blood”, becoming a PTR-certified coach at the age of 16. It meant working on court rather than in a high-street store during her A-levels it also, according to her doctors, played a part in saving her life when she contracted bacterial meningitis during her higher education.“At first the doctor thought I had a cold and then the paramedics thought I was on drugs,” she says. “Then I fell into a coma for a couple of days. A lot of people who go through meningitis come out with a visual impairment or other life-changing problems I came out completely unscathed and they said that, if it wasn’t for the fact that I was so sporty, I might not have survived because it was quite a severe case. I felt very lucky and it definitely made my love of sport stronger.”Darts and snooker were among her future on-screen assignments – along with a stint working on The Wright Stuff – but football became her specialism after she accepted an offer to front Star Sports’ coverage of the Indian Super League in 2015. It meant relocating for just over a year the plan after that was “to get to the World Cup, whatever happened” and, with her trajectory seemingly set for now, she wants younger people to know that a sense of drift does not mean the end of hope.“When I think of the person who was so confused about where she was going to go and didn’t know if she was making the right decisions, I know there are so many kids and young adults going through the same thing,” she says. “I think it’s even more pressurised now, and it’s important to be a role model for them. I’ve given a few talks on confidence, stuff I’ve learned as a presenter: the art of presenting is something I think everybody needs in some shape or form. We’re often in a position where we have to present or project ourselves but nobody ever really teaches you that.”That applies in general and, particularly, among those under-represented communities. Jaswal was, by her own admission, blown away by the primacy of football during her time in India – “I was told: ‘You’ve got a job on your hands’ because everyone loves cricket but the younger generation are totally obsessed” – but that is yet to be reflected globally on pitches or in her own role.“Again, it’s where you need role models,” she says. “The reason you don’t see many Asian footballers is that there haven’t been many for others to look up to. It would be nice to see more in media too but it’s the same as with gender: it just takes more people to go through and encourage others, and there are a lot of people working hard to do that.”She points out the example of her Premier League Productions colleague Manish Bhasin and namechecks a list of women who are, slowly but surely, helping to swing the sports broadcasting pendulum – Jacqui Oatley, Eni Aluko, Alex Scott, Gabby Logan, Natalie Sawyer, Kelly Cates and Caroline Barker, among others. All are outstanding professionals and Jaswal says that, above all else, is what matters.“I’d like to think the youngsters watching now will think it’s totally normal to see a range of people from different backgrounds on telly – to think: ‘I can be myself and still do it.’ But also that, no matter who you are or where you’re from, if you don’t know what you’re talking about and you’re not credible you’re not going to get there anyway. That’s the message I’d send to the generation looking up to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1a08ef3d9ff775c6adc2e8e9b75368073e73e3/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38dc40d64be442b1a3c505448bfbc511","title":"wembley sale shahid khan fa board backing council","story":"The Football Association board has approved in principle the sale of Wembley stadium for £600m to the Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars owner, Shahid Khan. The proposal, with protection for England, FA Cup and other prestige football matches to be played there, preservation of its name without a sponsor and reassurances that the proceeds will be spent on grassroots facilities, will next be presented to the FA council on 11 October.An FA spokesperson said: “The sale of Wembley stadium, the negotiated protections and an outlined plan to invest £600m into football community facilities, were presented and discussed at the FA board meeting today. Following on from this discussion, the FA board has agreed to take the presentation to the FA council to get its input now that the full facts are known.”The three representatives of the professional game on the FA’s 10-person board are understood to have been fully in favour of the plan, as have the chairman, Greg Clarke, and the chief executive, Martin Glenn. Since news of negotiations with Khan broke in April, Glenn in particular has publicly explained the FA’s view that it could transform grassroots facilities, describing it in a speech to the council in May as “an opportunity to unleash an unprecedented amount of investment into community football”.The former Manchester United and England player Gary Neville argued before a parliamentary committee in July that selling Wembley was “ridiculous” and more money for grassroots facilities should come from rich Premier League clubs or a levy on agents’ fees. However, no active efforts have been made since then to make such alternative funding a reality, and Glenn said in response then that the FA “has waited for years … hoping that something around the corner might turn up” and did not want to decline the Wembley sale on the promise of “jam tomorrow”.Ultimately the FA board has to sign off any sale, then approval is required from the government and Sport England, which contributed £120m of national lottery funds towards the £757m cost of rebuilding Wembley. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, and the chairman of Sport England, Nick Bitel, indicated in July they supported the sale in principle if the proceeds, including the public grants, will be reinvested in grassroots facilities via the Football Foundation.A statement from Fulham’s owner read: “The news from today’s FA Board meeting is welcomed and encouraging.\u0026nbsp I understand the discussion was open and thorough.\u0026nbsp One cannot ask for more as we continue to work through the process with the FA Board, FA Council, Sport England, the Mayor of London’s office and DCMS toward reaching an agreement that will serve English football for generations to come.\u0026nbsp Today’s development has no effect on my plans to renovate Craven Cottage and, as such, has no impact on Craven Cottage continuing to be the permanent home of Fulham Football Club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f587d5046ad9e2b23d4089a391f8c5a6b027c6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8904993fa339a8617ad510e7108401","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"The world’s most expensive keepers meet at Stamford Bridge, Emeryball is taking hold and time is not up for Marco SilvaWith Old Trafford currently resembling a passable imitation of the snake-filled Well of Souls into which Indiana Jones was temporarily sealed in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Manchester United will probably welcome an away trip, even if it is to the Premier League’s most ludicrous ground. With the exception of their lamentable surrender to Brighton at the Amex Stadium, Manchester United have performed better on the road than at home this season and now face a West Ham side that has rediscovered what passes for its mojo after starting the season with four consecutive league defeats. Declan Rice has been instrumental in their revival, acting as a defensive shield to a back four that has become compact and tight. Having neutralised Chelsea and scored eight past hapless Macclesfield in the past week, West Ham’s confidence is likely to be considerably higher than that of a Manchester United side who were outplayed by both Wolves and Derby County in the same period. Another poor result will prompt more tedious but unavoidable questions about José Mourinho’s future at the club and – far more seriously – may even have an adverse effect on the Apple Store rating of United’s mobile app. BG• West Ham v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm BST• Pogba’s agent to hold Man Utd talks in November over future• Cristiano Ronaldo’s one-game ban clears him to face Man Utd• Daniel Taylor: Mourinho’s scowl sums up Manchester United moodThere has been relatively little scrutiny so far on the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, largely because Kepa has not had a great deal to do since Chelsea bought him for around £5m more than Liverpool paid for Alisson three weeks previously. He looked a trifle shaky early on in his debut against Huddersfield and was at fault for Arsenal’s first goal in the following match but neither of those sides, nor any other, were able to put him through a really searching examination. That will probably change on Saturday, when Liverpool can be expected to give him his more serious test of the season so far. Something similar could be said of Allison at the other end, although he is more experienced and, what is more, has a stronger defence in front of him. PD• Chelsea v Liverpool, Saturday 5.30pm BST• Paul Wilson: Kepa and Alisson show youth beats experience for keepers• Hazard offers hope of signing new contract at Chelsea• Chelsea are match for Liverpool but Kanté poses midfield puzzleHere is a fact: Arsenal are not playing as well as their recent results suggest. Here is another: it does not particularly matter. Last Sunday they were largely bailed out by wasteful Everton finishing and an egregious misjudgment by the officials it was hardly fun and games in the wins over West Ham, Cardiff and Newcastle either but the results are, at least against the lesser sides, trickling in. It is a huge help to Umai Emery, who you suspect will need an entire season to really cement the cultural and stylistic changes he requires. There are signs Emeryball is changing Arsenal for the better – they have made more challenges and interceptions, and entered into more duels, per-minute of opposition possession than anyone else in the ision – but things are not quite clicking with the ball and for now they may have to be grateful for flourishes like Alexandre Lacazette’s super goal against Everton or Granit Xhaka’s free-kick at Newcastle. Watford will hope their run of good fortune does not last Arsenal would take three points in whatever form if it means their transition behind the scenes can continue without too much scrutiny. NA• Arsenal v Watford, Saturday 3pm BST• Ramsey poised to leave Arsenal after club withdraw contract offerCrystal Palace need someone other than Wilfried Zaha to start scoring regularly for them. Andros Townsend netted twice in this week’s Carabao Cup win against West Brom but that is all he managed in the whole of last season and he has never scored more than four in a Premier League campaign. Maybe he is about to embark on a hot streak but the suspicion is that Bournemouth’s David Brooks, who has never scored a Premier League goal, will finish this season with a bigger haul than Townsend. The 21-year-old’s exciting play has been a highlight of Bournemouth campaign so far – shining even during last week’s lamentable trouncing at Burnley – and it seems only a matter of time before he starts finishing as well as creating chances from out wide, possibly as soon as Monday’s visit by Palace. PD• Bournemouth v Crystal Palace, Monday 8pm BST• Football Weekly Extra: Carabao bangers and lucky cucumbersImproving with every performance, Wolves are proving a breath of fresh air in a Premier League in which no team more than Southampton increasingly resemble an acrid, eggy fart by comparison. Showing little or no indication so far that they’re either good or bad enough to do anything even remotely interesting this season, they look content to just hang around in the Premier League, as is their inalienable right if they can accumulate the requisite number of points. However, away at Molineux against a team of entertainers fast turning into media darlings, they have a chance to make a statement and turn some heads by putting the Premier League newcomers back in their box with an unexpected slap-down. Instead, expect them to troop off the pitch reasonably satisfied with a 2-0 or 3-1 defeat, after which Mark Hughes will use his post-match interview to grumble about some perceived refereeing injustice that only happened in his head. Surprise us, Southampton. The gauntlet is down. BG• Wolves v Southampton, Saturday 3pm BST• Wolves’ Neves and Jota: ‘Porto has wine, food but here it’s fine’There is a lot to be said for wielding the axe quickly and decisively but calls for Everton to give Marco Silva the chop already are premature. He inherited a hotchpotch squad and, owing mainly to injuries and suspensions, has not been able to field his strongest team in his six league matches so far, yet Everton could still have won all of those if they had finished better. That, of course, is the team’s biggest problem – they have yet to find an adequate replacement for Romelu Lukaku despite all the money spent – and Silva needs to address that problem as best he can. On Saturday it could pay to deploy either Richarlison or Theo Walcott as a central striker, especially if Bernard is given a start out wide after his impressive introduction at Arsenal. If Silva persists with Cenk Tosun or Dominic Calvert-Lewin, he might find himself wishing that Everton, rather than Fulham, had signed Aleksandar Mitrovic last summer. PD• Everton v Fulham, Saturday 3pm BST• Everton move helped me to become England’s keeper, says Pickford• Wembley stadium sale to Khan on course after FA board gives backingThe statistics do not look especially good for Huddersfield. Twentieth in the Premier League table tells its own story but few of the trends underpinning it give hope of an imminent upturn. Their “expected goals” tally of 3.57 sits rock bottom of the pile, too, a good 1.3 shy of its closest rival their number of touches in the opposition box lags well behind everybody except Brighton while only Newcastle have managed fewer shots. They are leaking goals at the other end too and, while a fiendish opening couple of games against Chelsea and Manchester City are partly to blame, David Wagner’s side have not exactly served up much encouragement since. Quite simply they do not get enough players into enemy territory and they may find it difficult to commit too many men forward against a Tottenham team that, having cleared their heads with a 2-1 win at Brighton on Saturday, do not appear as vulnerable as they might have a week ago. These two teams have used more players (Tottenham, 23, Huddersfield 22) since the season began than any others in the ision bar Manchester United Mauricio Pochettino can point to strength in depth but Wagner really needs to find a combination that works. NA• Huddersfield v Tottenham, Saturday 3pm BST• Pochettino praises calmer, more mature captain Alli• Pochettino hopes to be in Spurs’ new stadium before ChristmasMartín Montoya was once tipped as the obvious heir to Dani Alves at Barcelona but things did not quite pan out like that. The 27-year-old has had a decent career so far, nonetheless, and has made a good impact at Brighton since joining the club in the summer. On Saturday he may have to produce his best performance yet for Chris Hughton’s side as he comes up against the team run by the manager who nurtured him when he was young at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola. Manchester City are likely to omit a couple of key players to preserve them for Tuesday’s Champions League mission to Hoffenheim, which they can ill-afford to botch after losing at home to Lyon, but this will be a fearsome challenge for Brighton whose only win this season has come against the lesser of the Manchester teams. PD• Manchester City v Brighton, Saturday 3pm BST• Foden laughs at Iniesta comparisons after first City goal• Atlético Madrid dump Man City out of Women’s Champions League• Ashworth quits FA to take up post at BrightonHaving accumulated just their second point from six games in a dire scoreless draw against Crystal Palace last week, Newcastle entertain Leicester at the end of a week in which a tedious row has rumbled over whether or not they are a “big club” and Kevin Keegan has confirmed what many suspected about the cavalier, borderline cowboy manner in which Mike Ashley runs his St James’ Park operation. Only Rafael Benítez knows why he’s still bothering to man the tiller of this permanently listing ship, but having been handed a nightmare start to the season by the fixture generator, Newcastle can at least look forward to a comparatively kind set of fixtures – including Manchester United at Old Trafford next week – between now and their visit to Anfield on Boxing Day. By then, we should have a fair idea whether or not this side is well-equipped enough to continue treading water in the manner that so pleases its depressingly unambitious owner. BG• Newcastle United v Leicester City, Saturday 3pm• Kevin Keegan: ‘No, I’m not going to take a compliment from Ashley’Neil Warnock repeated this week that he prefers the Championship to the Premier League and it is not hard to understand why: a better balance of abilities thought the second tier makes intrigue run deeper. All the same, the Cardiff City manager will do his utmost to keep his team in the top flight this season. But the longer they go without a win, the harder it will be to fend off fatalism. Beating Burnley this weekend – after three defeats in a row – would do a power of good to the Welsh team and pull Sean Dyche’s side right back into bother after they got their first league victory last weekend. Warnock has several difficult selection posers to resolve, including whether to restore Sol Bamba to the centre of his defence and whether to entrust main attacking duties to Josh Murphy or persist with Bobby Reid. Whoever he plumps for, this is sure to be a full-blooded contest.

I can see why and no more so, in my opinion, than in regards to the women’s prize. Marta is one of my favourite players, and one of the best players I’ve had the privilege of coming up against, so I say this with the greatest respect: there are other players who were in a much stronger position to be named the best female player of 2018.Marta taking home the award for a sixth time has caused bafflement within the women’s game given the other more obvious candidates for the honour, such as Pernille Harder, who has had two very strong seasons, notably leading Denmark to the European Championship finals and scoring in the 2018 Champions League final for Wolfsburg. Harder was named Uefa’s women’s player of the year but didn’t even make the top three for Fifa’s award. Also Australia’s Sam Kerr, who finished as top scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League in the US for a second year running, a league widely regarded as one of the strongest in women’s football.Then there is my old Chelsea teammate Fran Kirby, who is coming off the back of an outstanding season, winning multiple inidual accolades, including the Football Writers’ player of the year, as well as helping Chelsea secure the double and scoring a crucial Champions League away goal at Bayern Munich. Yet, like Harder, Fran didn’t even make Fifa’s top 10.What adds to the sense of confusion is the fact that voting for the award took place between August 2017 and May 2018 in other words, during the European season. So how could a European player not win it?Why did Marta, a Brazilian, win? Probably because she has become a safe vote after many years of outstanding performances, but it’s a safe vote that does nothing to help raise the profile of women’s football. Greater accuracy of voting can be achieved by making sure the award is given to players who are in form and have made a big contribution to their respective teams, not only because doing so will give prominence to a greater number of female players but also because it will motivate them to strive for even more excellence.If, say, a striker knows that scoring 30 goals in a season will lead to them winning a prestigious award then they will try that little bit harder because, regardless of what players may say, inidual recognition on the world stage is important. On the flip side, if players are trying their hardest and posting great numbers but then see an inidual prize given to someone who doesn’t deserve it, then it devalues all of that hard work.Fifa must do more in this regard, specifically by ensuring that during the voting period as much content as possible, in terms of goals and footage of players from around the world, is seen by as wide an audience as possible. That way when people come to vote for the best female player they appreciate fully who the leading candidates are.Doing so is not difficult, either. For instance, there is no reason why a montage of goals and assists of the top-10 candidates for the women’s award cannot be put together and rolled out across social media at a specific time in the year. In a world overloaded with information and content, there is simply no excuse for fans to be ill-informed about women’s football.In regards to the men’s award, Luka Modric was a worthy recipient of the main prize. There is an obvious debate surrounding whether or not Cristiano Ronaldo should have won but Modric also claimed the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and was a key reason why Croatia finished second at the World Cup. For me, Modric leading Croatia to the silver medal in Russia is as great an achievement as Kylian Mbappé turning out exceptional performances for the champions, France, because of the relative size of Croatia as a nation. Let’s not forget that Modric was also named the best player at the World Cup, which on its own makes him a very strong contender for the Best award.Like most people, I do have an issue with the winner of the Puskas Award. I said in last week’s column that I’m a huge fan of Mohamed Salah but that goal he scored against Everton was nowhere near the best one scored in the world this year. For me, the award should have gone to Ronaldo for the unbelievable bicycle kick he scored for Real Madrid against Juventus. It was a stunning display of on-pitch gymnastics and one of those strikes that gets better each time you watch it.I remember watching it live, taking a video of the replay and being stunned at the sheer brilliance of Ronaldo. Given how Juventus fans who were inside the stadium that night reacted to the goal – with a standing ovation – it can also be argued that was the moment Cristiano’s love affair with Juve began, which in turn led to the most high-profile transfer of the summer.Speaking of Juventus, all of us in the women’s squad are bitterly disappointed to be out of the Champions League following our 1-0 loss to Brondby on Wednesday. We started very well, created clear chances in the first 30 minutes and should have won the game early. But we didn’t and at that level you get punished for not being clinical. Brondby then scored against the run of play and it became a bigger mountain to climb given we had to score at least twice after the first leg in Turin had ended 2-2. We tried our hardest but ultimately it was not enough.Without going over old ground too much, this is why the women’s Champions League needs to have a group stage. Yes, it’s up to us as players to get the job done but a straight knockout format means that the high levels of investment required to build European squads for clubs such as Juventus and Manchester City (who were also knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday, by Atlético Madrid) is put at risk too early by a tough draw. If you guarantee six group games in the Champions League, that investment becomes more worthwhile and players build a much deeper European experience.For us it’s now a case of using the disappointment and hurt of going out of the Champions League as motivation to win the Super Cup against Fiorentina, which is coming up soon, as well as retaining the league title. That’s certainly my ambition as well as the collective ambition of everyone at Juventus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c11d01103e8e3953edbba965b0f326f52089716/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bee2d297a51f3202304dbb2e6bb0229","title":"christine blasey ford testimony brett kavanaugh metoo","story":"Ford describes ‘civic duty’ to share her story, highlighting slow progress decades after Anita Hill’s hearingEleven days after stepping forward to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, after receiving death threats and being forced to relocate from her home, having her email hacked and her life laid bare for the public to interrogate and scrutinize, Dr Christine Blasey Ford walked in to Dirksen Senate Office Building 226 prepared to relive a moment that she said “drastically altered” her life.The cramped room, limited to a handful of invited guests, including the actor and activist Alyssa Milano and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, fell into an anxious silence as Ford raised her right hand and swore to tell the “truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”.She didn’t want to be there, she told the members of the Senate judiciary committee in her first public comments. She was terrified, she said. She came, she said, because it was her “civic duty” to share her story about the “boy who sexually assaulted me” – a man she repeatedly and unequivocally identified as Donald Trump’s second supreme court nominee. Kavanaugh, who testified after her, has forcefully denied the allegation.“I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t remember as much as I would like to,” Ford said, her voice wavering with emotion as she delivered her remarks. “But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget.”As Ford read from a prepared statement, she occasionally peered at the dais over large-framed glasses that had slipped down her nose.The senators – 17 men and only four women – sat facing her in rapt attention. Their fixed gazes were an indication of just how extraordinary this moment was for the Senate, and the nation.The scene evoked images from the 1991 hearing during the confirmation process for the supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas, when his former colleague, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment with millions of Americans watching around the country. The specter of an all-male panel questioning a black woman prompted a social movement that culminated in 1992 election being declared the “Year of the Woman” – when the number of women in the US Senate doubled.“Our institutions have not progressed in how they treat women who come forward,” lamented Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was among those women elected to the Senate that year and is now the ranking Democrat on the panel.“Too often, women’s memories and credibility come under assault,” Feinstein, who initially received Ford’s letter detailing her sexual assault claim, continued. “In essence, they are put on trial and forced to defend themselves and often re-victimized in the process.”Around the Capitol, women wearing pins that said “I believe Christine Blasey Ford” and “#MeToo” wept openly as they huddled over phones to watch a livestream of the hearing. They crossed with supporters of the judge, who wore shirts that said “Women for Kavanaugh” and carried signs that said “Confirm Kavanaugh” and “presumed innocent in America”. Donald Trump watched part of the hearing from aboard Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington from New York.The side-by-side protests brought into sharp relief how Kavanaugh’s nomination has inflamed a deep cultural ide in today’s #MeToo era of reckoning on sexual assault and harassment.Democrats have embraced the #MeToo movement and see it as a galvanizing force at the midterm elections this November, which are seen as a referendum on Trump. Already, a record number of Democratic women are running for office and a growing number of female candidates are being considered for a presidential run in 2020.Republicans, however, have treaded carefully. They’ve stood by Kavanaugh and defended his integrity while stressing that Ford deserved to be heard. On Thursday, they hired a female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, to question Kavanaugh and Ford on their behalf.During the hearing, Mitchell methodically asked Ford what she remembered about the alleged incident. But she was interrupted every five minutes for the Democrats to have their turn to ask questions. Their starkly different approaches was jarring and at times awkward.“You are not on trial,” Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California, sought to assure Ford. “You are sitting here before members of the United States senate judiciary committee because you have the courage to come forward.”And in a sign of what has changed in the 27 years since Hill came forward, Harris told Ford: “I believe you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a295125e6f1afe6e4e547fbe5d945a68d56f6ca/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd2d8d98bfad386143e6392637729e5","title":"from the human eye to hubble a brief history of our quest for better vision","story":"Technology today enables us to ‘look’ millions of light years across the universe, but up until 400 years ago we didn’t even have telescopes.

So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f459d145c3362f55e92770924276c598f92b42bf/0_156_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5f9a43bb7cab56d6cc0c31b69b2fbc53 1760w","title":"government hid details of northern powerhouse minister james wharton visits to the north","story":"Government spent two years trying to conceal how infrequently James Wharton travelled to north of EnglandThe government has spent two years and £40,000 of taxpayers’ money trying to hide how little the northern powerhouse minister visited the north of England in his role, in what one prominent northern figure called “a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability”.In February 2016 the  submitted a freedom of information (FoI) request to the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) asking how regularly James Wharton, who had then been northern powerhouse minister for just over six months, travelled outside London.The department flouted a requirement to respond to the request within 20 working days and did not provide a response for more than four months – at which point it denied the application.The Information Commissioner’s Office then undertook an investigation, during the course of which it found that the department adopted “what appears to have been a strategy of wilful procrastination in order to obstruct a request for information”.The DCLG appealed against the decision to the first-tier tribunal of information rights, where in early 2018 Judge Hazel Oliver ruled that the department must hand over Wharton’s diary.From start to finish, the process took 26 months.The department fought for so long to prevent the release of the information that two other men, Andrew Percy and Jake Berry, have since taken up the role of northern powerhouse minister, and the entire department has been renamed as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.However, internal communications revealed by subsequent  FoI requests show that despite spending £40,000 trying to stymie the release of information, the government knew as early as March 2016 it had little chance of preventing the information being made public.Hidden in 111 pages of internal DCLG emails relating to the FoI request is a document headlined “Official – Sensitive” dating from March 2016 which includes official advice stating “there is a strong likelihood of a decision to withhold the requested information … being overturned”.Legal experts are unimpressed. “It sounds like a classic: they knew they were likely to lose and still wasted time and money on it, and come out looking even worse,” said Paul Bernal, senior lecturer in law at the University of East Anglia.Manchester-based data protection consultant Tim Turner said: “Departments have shown time and again that they’re very secretive about who ministers meet and what they do, and spending £40,000 to hide it doesn’t seem close to the spirit of open government.”The information that the government tried to suppress for two years shows that Wharton rarely left London as part of his role as the north’s representative in government.Of the 693 lines of entries in Wharton’s ministerial diary, just under half contain identifiable addresses or office rooms in the “Location” column. Ninety percent of them are based in London.Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a Manchester-based thinktank, said: “It is of course disappointing that the minister charged with the northern powerhouse spent so little time in the area getting to understand what’s important to the people, communities and businesses of the north.“But the attempts to thwart access to information about the work of the northern powerhouse minister show a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability.“The government need to use this as an opportunity to build a much more robust system of transparency and accountability, so that voters in the north can have confidence that the government are really serious and committed to supporting northern leaders to build a better future for the north.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: “We respect the outcome of the tribunal and have now released the information as requested.” They did not acknowledge queries about the low number of visits to the north of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1742487a708c008992b46eeb3a6cd3001eac1d4/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=475caa264858a1d94de4d6780b0c3a26","title":"theresa may un iran brexit analysis","story":"PM’s foreign policies have been submerged by Brexit, giving the impression the UK has checked out of world debatesA mixture of personal praise of Donald Trump, sympathy for the UK after the chemical attack in Salisbury and safety in sheer numbers protected Theresa May from being on the front rank of international leaders who lined up at the UN general assembly to criticize Donald Trump’s Iran policy.Other European leaders – including Margot Wallstrom the Swedish foreign minister and Emmanuel Macron, the global torch bearer of multilateralism – openly rebuked Trump at the Security Council meeting on Wednesday.“We have tried sanctions over the years. We tried isolation, and it only gave the most conservative forces in Iran more power,” said Wallstrom. Macron suggested that Trump had no long-term strategy.Off stage, the Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen was even more direct, saying that “a war with Iran will sooner or later be envisaged.”May, by contrast, was matter-of-fact in her disagreement with the US, preferring to focus her fire on Russia for its “desperate fabrications” over Salisbury – remarks that provoked a stinging rebuke from the somewhat cornered Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.The prime minister tried to minimise her differences with Trump by praising him personally for his leadership role in seeking to reach an agreement with North Korea, which she described as the world’s most potent nuclear threat. She made no comment on the wider damage caused by Trump’s decision to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran.But there was no disguising the fact that the UK finds itself in the awkward position of being at odds with Trump over a central issue of his administration: how to make Iran change course.May and her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, have joined with France, Germany, Russia and China in concluding that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, and – whatever its malign behaviour elsewhere there is no evidence that a sanctions squeeze will produce a more flexible mindset in Tehran – let alone regime change.That view is held strongly throughout the foreign office, and national security network, despite the frustration of some of the UK’s closest allies in the Gulf such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.The UAE – ferocious networkers in British government circles – have for more than a year tried to persuade the UK to confront Iran over its behaviour in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.The language between the US and the EU over sanctions is also becoming fruity.It is not a conversation that UK officials enjoy, as they seek to show Britain can have leverage over Iran. But in truth, the British voice on everything else at the UN counts for less than it did under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown – or even David Cameron. May’s forays onto the international stage have been perfunctory by contrast Brown was at the UN on Monday drawing the crowds as he banged the drum to find ways to raise extra cash for education in Africa.But if May has any foreign policy theme, it is submerged by Brexit.Broadcasters accompanying her to New York were each allocated four questions – and each confined themselves to Brexit – as if Iran, the UK’s aid budget, Myanmar, Yemen or even the UK military bombing of Syria were non-issues.Such monomania leaves the impression that the UK is a country apart, involved in its own conversation, and checked out from the world debates.That is not a true picture of British diplomatic effectiveness at the UN – but sometimes impressions become the reality.Even if all goes to plan with Brexit, next year’s general assembly will be just as hard.For the first time in decades, Britain will find itself as a non European Union member, forced to justify its claim to be one of the five permanent members of the UN security council – and British leaders (whoever they may be) will have to work even harder just to be heard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a9550995006ef651c9b2b01b28e150e1993263/392_159_3860_2317/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=210a136b5f80628048c98cfa3af9d5b5","title":"derek hatton rejoins labour 33 years after neil kinnock kicked him out","story":"Hard-left ex-politician inspired by Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘passionate and powerful socialist leadership’Derek Hatton, the hard-left former deputy leader of Liverpool council, has rejoined the Labour party – 33 years after he was booted out by the then leader Neil Kinnock.Hatton was expelled for belonging to a left-wing militant faction. He caused national outcry in the 1980s by setting an illegal budget and was denounced at the 1985 Labour conference for sending redundancy notices by taxi to thousands of council workers.He and other members of a Trotskyite group known as the Militant Tendency were widely blamed for making the party unelectable during Kinnock’s tenure.Hatton has now revealed he was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership to reapply for membership.The 70-year-old, writing in the Liverpool Echo, said he spent much of the last 33 years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular at Tony Blair’s decision to invade Iraq.However, he said he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and that the recent Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin.He wrote: “In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics.“Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.He added: “Now I’m a ‘Labour party member’ I believe nothing should take our eye off the ball of securing a Labour government under Corbyn.”The Liverpool Echo reported that despite returning to the party, Hatton had no plans to run for public office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e4737fc6aff30680d49acca0f4acab87dd9d9e/21_75_3461_2077/master/3461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efdacce06891ebcd5d39809349b42fda","title":"hedge funds purchase of brexit vote polling data under scrutiny","story":"Treasury committee chair questions use of private polling to profit on pound’s fallPolling companies are facing parliamentary scrutiny over the sale of private polls to hedge funds during the Brexit referendum, which were used to place huge bets on the pound.Nicky Morgan, a Conservative MP and chair of the powerful Treasury select committee, has written to British Polling Council president, Sir John Curtice, warning that the use of private polling data during election and referendum campaigns could risk the integrity of financial markets.It follows a Bloomberg report earlier this year into private polling data sold by companies such as YouGov, Survation and ICM in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote.They were bought by hedge funds eager to cash in on extreme volatility in currency markets and profit from the result of the EU referendum, with several commissioning private exit polls in order to bet on the price of sterling.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that leave was to emerge victorious, netting millions for those on the right side of the bet.Immediately after the Brexit referendum polls closed at 10pm on 23 June 2016, the then Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, gave an interview to Sky News in which he said “it looks like Remain will edge it”.The news of an apparent concession by the leave campaign’s most prominent figure immediately after polls closed briefly pushed the value of sterling up to its highest level in six months.However, when the pound subsequently crashed as the true result became clear, any iniduals or companies with short bets would have profited. Shorting is the practice of selling shares or other assets which you do not own, in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price in the future and making a profit.Farage has denied placing currency bets against sterling and told Bloomberg in June that the only external exit poll he received on the day of the referendum was conducted by Survation. Survation’s poll correctly predicted that leave would win the referendum.He repeatedly told Bloomberg that he learned the results of the exit poll “minutes after” Sky broadcast his comments.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury committee and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It’s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, while providing more accurate – and lucrative – analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8756420d64613d430e66dec80c2b2e84a214628d/0_0_3290_2480/master/3290.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4893d55acc5c86301c275b856b0e668b 1760w","title":"lewis hamilton refreshed stronger russian grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes he is stronger than ever as he prepares for the Russian Grand Prix this weekend. The British driver goes into the race with a 40-point advantage over his title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, and is confident he and Mercedes will prove competitive in Sochi.Six rounds of the world championship remain and Hamilton goes into them firmly on the front foot. He has won four of the last five races and comes to Russia on the back of a dominant win at the last round in Singapore, after which he took a break which proved beneficial.“I feel healthy, happier and stronger than ever,” he said. “It still feels like it has been a long year. But I have had plenty of time to myself, and some really good quality time with family, so I do feel really good for this last stint.”Hamilton is attempting to secure his fifth F1 title, and fourth with Mercedes, but he emphasised that he was still constantly pushing his team. “We are all stuck in our ways, it is hard for us to change,” he said.“When you work with engineers it is similar and breaking patterns and moulds and challenging people, that’s what I live to do. I am a pain in the arse to my engineers, because I am always challenging. I like to think it has a positive impact to spring an idea or a direction to push the car.”Last year the Russian Grand Prix took place early in the season and Hamilton struggled with performance, particularly in working his tyres, and finished fourth. Now he is more confident. “I believe this weekend we will be in a better position than we were last year,” he said. “Our understanding of the tyre is far greater than last year but it’s still a challenge.”Vettel could still take the title if he won and Hamilton was second in all the remaining races and in Russia he insisted he was focused on keeping the fight alive. “I think it’s very simple from where we are,” he said. “We are some points behind and we need to catch up to make sure we stay there.“That’s our target and the best way to do that is to finish ahead, and ideally ahead of everybody. So the plan doesn’t really change. Obviously at this point we try to give it everything we have and I still believe that we have the chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9e3c96212b692a179a67521801c6588e0e4cc16/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dab1fa9d9064b2568504961560a9c3b","title":"ryder cup 2018 opening ceremony wives girlfriends tadd fujikawa","story":"As the players’ wives and girlfriends stand behind their men in France, Tadd Fujikawa’s struggles reinforce the sense that the men’s game is stuck in the pastThe 42nd Ryder Cup started, like so many others before them, with the formal introduction of the wives and girlfriends. They were made to dress up like Stepford Wives and march in a parade on to the stage, where they made an immaculate backdrop for the opening ceremony. They spent the next hour sitting and standing, waving and clapping. They do not even get to stand by their men but have to line up behind them.It is not really clear why the Ryder Cup feels the need to have them do this. It must be the only sporting event that makes a point of staging a parade for the players’ partners and putting out lists of “attending spouses”. It is, as they say at Augusta, a tradition like no other, and one they should have dispensed with a while back.They do not do it at the Solheim Cup. The husbands and boyfriends are not made to troop on stage in matching shirts and blazers. But at the Ryder Cup, the wives and girlfriends – never yet a husband or boyfriend – are such an integral part of the show that the few players who show up alone say they feel pretty conspicuous about being single. Rickie Fowler was last time around but not this. The best thing about it, he said, was that this time he will “actually have someone to kiss” if his team win.Instead, Fowler said, they will all “make fun of Bryson DeChambeau”, who has come on his own. Europe’s singleton is Thorbjørn Olesen, who got to make a threesome with Ian and Katie Poulter when it was all over and everyone had to march off, arm-in-arm with their partners.Jim Furyk, ever-so-earnest, picked up on the theme when he filled a stretch of his speech with a long tribute to his wife Tabitha who, he said, as he stared misty-eyed into the middle distance like an army vet having a combat flashback, “loves the Ryder Cup as much as I do”. He thanked all the women “for putting up with us”.Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European Tour, keeps talking about how he wants the game to “embrace change and modernise to appeal to a wider market”, that it needs to evolve to appeal to “the millennial demographic”.Seth Waugh, who is just starting as the chief executive of the PGA of America, says that he wants to make golf look and feel more like “our kids’ game as opposed to our parents’ game”.They might make a small step in the right direction by cutting out this all ridiculous 1950s family values carry-on from their signature competition. Golf never looks so straight or so silly as it does at the opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup.The competition could do with a man like Tadd Fujikawa. Sadly, he is not on the USA’s team, or even all that close to it since he is ranked 2,035th in the world. Ten years ago, he was one of the most talented teenage players in the world. In 2006 he became the youngest player ever to qualify for the US Open, when he was just 16. The year after that, he became the youngest man in 50 years to make the cut in a PGA event, the Sony Open in Hawaii.Since then, he has struggled because of anxiety and depression. It got so bad that he thought about quitting the sport.Until a fortnight ago, when Fujikawa decided to do something about it. He came out. On 11 September, just after World Suicide Prevention Day, Fujikawa put up an Instagram post that started: “So … I’m gay.” Fujikawa explained he was not sure whether to do it but decided to because “I remember how much others’ stories have helped me in my darkest times to have hope. I spent way too long pretending, hiding and hating who I was. I was always afraid of what others would think or say.“I’ve struggled with my mental health for many years because of that and it put me in a really bad place. Now I’m standing up for myself and the rest of the LGBTQ community.”Fujikawa is the first, and so far only, openly gay male professional golfer in the history of the game. In a follow-up interview with GQ he explained that his depression was not just down to being closeted but it was a large part of it, “because I was so deathly afraid of stuff coming out and just not accepting myself at all”.The negative responses, he said, were the ones who asked him: “Who cares?” Because “as much as it shouldn’t matter, it does matter, because people are still struggling”. Only, so far as he knows, none of them are on the tour with him.Draw and tee-off times for the opening fourballs of the 42nd Ryder Cup, Europe v United States, at Le Golf National, Paris, France on Friday, 28 September (Europe names first, all times BST)\u0026nbsp0710 Justin Rose and Jon Rahm v Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau\u0026nbsp0725 Rory McIlroy and Thorbjørn Olesen v Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler\u0026nbsp0740 Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton v Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas\u0026nbsp0755 Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood v Patrick Reed and Tiger WoodsBack in 2014, Golf Monthly asked 200 top players whether they thought there were any gay men on tour.

It’s an opportunity to go out there and be the best that you can be on a grand stage.”Europe are well aware of the task in hand. By virtue of world rankings alone, the visiting team are one of the finest ever assembled in golf. Between them, they have accumulated 31 major championships. That five debutants appear in Bjørn’s band of 12 has also been a regular point of reference.It remains an oddity that so many team events are defined by iniduals. Woods’s resurgence on the golf course has coincided with a different outlook beyond it. Whereas the 14-times major champion was once such a closed character that fitting into the Ryder Cup dynamic was infamously problematic, Tiger version 2.0 is at the centre of an American setup anxious to win on European soil for the first time in 25 years.The biennial meeting of Europe and the USA does not need Woods’s involvement, but it is unquestionably all the better for it. Victory at last weekend’s Tour Championship cranked the excitement to a palpable extent. Woods also has his own, questionable Ryder Cup history to alter.Snapshots point towards his attitude. When closing a practice session on Thursday, Thomas placed a chunk of turf on the 42-year-old’s head in a very public jibe towards a receding hairline. Such a prank would have been unthinkable even a decade ago, where now it draws collective laughs. Herein lies what is widely cited as a US basis for success – team spirit. Nonetheless, when the gun goes, the group still have to hit shots and hole putts. Camaraderie does not automatically equal glory.You cannot really say the phoney war is over when the phoney war never existed. Disappointingly for those of us who prefer the scent of cordite around sporting battles, the Ryder Cup has evolved – or regressed – into the territory of mutual back-slapping.There is an obvious explanation for that many of the participants encounter each other on Floridian school runs. Very cosy, very chummy. And not much use really. This may change, of course. Bjørn in particular has capacity to blow a fuse if suitably prodded. Poulter, McIlroy, Spieth and Reed are not known for shying away from confrontation should it arise.Le Golf National is the one baring teeth. This could be the toughest Ryder Cup venue in history. Relatively tight, firm fairways combine with fierce rough, rendering accuracy paramount. The contrast with the vast, horrendously dull expanses of Hazeltine, where USA triumphed two years ago, could barely be more pronounced.In theory, this backdrop affords Europe a greater advantage than bookmakers have been willing to acknowledge. The unconvincing recent form of several American players is also an underplayed point.For venue comparison, the Stadium Course at Sawgrass – which hosts the Players Championship – has been thrown up with regularity. Intriguingly, since Fred Funk prevailed at that tournament in 2005 only five Americans have done likewise. Four of them will feature here: Phil Mickelson, Woods, Fowler and Webb Simpson. European winners of the Players in the same time, Sergio García and Stenson, are also present while Poulter is a two-times Sawgrass runner-up.The Ryder Cup has developed into an unseemly corporate beast which, as is depressingly common at marquee sporting events, hangers-on identify as a place to be seen. At 7.10am (BST)(8.10am local time on Friday, clubs in hand for what is a treacherous tee shot, the main protagonists will at last step forward. “This is an opportunity,” Bjørn added, “to stand up and follow in the footsteps of all the great players of this continent.”USA need 14 points to retain the cup, Europe 14.5 to snatch it back. A country noted for passion and flair provides an idyllic backdrop. The 42nd Ryder Cup will be one for the ages. Perseverance? A prerequisite. Napoleon would approve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec05fc77cca60330f576f3fce1e7157f3bf0cbbf/116_401_5289_3174/master/5289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fdd36f4c32cd5263159909243ff9563","title":"favourite harold pinter play antony sher hayley squires paapa essiedu","story":"Stars of the West End’s Pinter at the Pinter season pick plays by the dramatist that changed the way they thought about theatreIt’s not his first play, but The Caretaker was the one where Pinter invented himself as an extraordinary dramatist. The impact was felt around the world and even reached me, a teenager in Cape Town. It transformed my way of thinking about drama and obsessed me.His world was threatening yet funny in his dialogue, cliches suddenly become dangerous little bombs. When I came to London to audition for drama school, I did one of Mick’s speeches from The Caretaker. I’m not sure it was a good idea as I got turned down by the top schools.The Caretaker has a fascinating setup: the old homeless man, the spivvy East End boy Mick and his older brother. Pinter weaves threads between these three completely unalike characters and creates drama out of an undramatic situation – and comedy, too.In the West End season, I’m doing One for the Road which is about torture. Pinter wrote it out of extreme anger yet it has a strangely playful comic edge. I remember seeing him as Lenny in The Homecoming in Watford in 1969. You don’t really expect playwrights to be the best people to perform in their own plays, but it was an extraordinary display of great Pinter acting.Celebration was the first Pinter play I worked on at drama school 10 years ago. Two couples are at an upscale restaurant loosely based on the Ivy. There’s an underlying sense that they come from working-class backgrounds and have risen up. At the table next to them is a younger couple who sit much more easily within this world but they’re struggling within their relationship. They’re trying to cope with each other’s inadequacies in this repressed, quite violent way.People talk about Pinter’s plays having this dangerous element, that nothing is ever as it seems and that his characters never really talk about what they think. Celebration kind of twists that. They all talk about things that they mean but that shouldn’t be spoken about in these circumstances. They’re talking about people they’ve loved before or about having affairs. You’re sort of waiting for someone to batter someone, but it never happens. I write as well and Pinter planted in me this fascination about love and hate – how one feeds the other and one doesn’t exist without the other.Pinter’s pauses have turned into this huge thing that weighs heavily on actors and directors. Often what he meant was it’s just a breath for the actor before going into a new line of thought or questioning. In his plays, the characters throw missiles at each other. It’s a moment of breath before you throw your next missile.My first encounter with Pinter’s work was The Dumb Waiter. It was like nothing I’d ever read before: that mix of the danger and the goofy vaudeville comedy. It’s quite Beckettian: these two blokes sitting in a basement waiting for something to happen and talking about semantics and stuff like the best way to say, “Put the kettle on.” Eventually, it becomes clear that they’re hitmen waiting for a job.When I was 17, I did The Dumb Waiter in the most amateur of amateur productions at my school. Fortunately, it was before video so it’s never seen the light of day. I did then see it performed a few years later at the Trafalgar Studios in London with Lee Evans and Jason Isaacs. They brought out the slapstick potential in the play as well as the menace. Now Lee has come out of retirement for our Pinter season.Pinter had the ability to condense language. In his plays not a single syllable in a word, in a sentence, in a paragraph is superfluous. It’s all necessary and contributes to create this pressure-cooker tension but it never – or very rarely – explodes. That tension is mesmeric. You can’t take your eyes off it.• Pinter at the Pinter, a season of one-act plays, is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 23 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a50a294de12f66b1d4541c5292f9a1961146e04/1_0_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c213eb64cd06c6ca73a4d4a00a6210","title":"iphone xs max review apple supersized smartphone","story":"Its massive screen is beautiful, but has it lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X so good?Apple’s top of the line smartphone has been supersized in both screen size and price, but is the iPhone XS Max really worth the eye-watering £1,099-plus asking price?Apple’s biggest achievement is that the colossal screen has been squeezed into a body that isn’t that enormous. The iPhone XS Max is certainly a big phone, but at 7.7mm thick it’s thinner than all of the current top-end phones, including the 8.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy Note 9.At 157.5mm long the iPhone XS Max is also shorter than even phones with much smaller screens such as the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL (157.9mm long), the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ (158.1mm long) and is a full 4.4mm shorter than the Note 9.The thing is the iPhone XS Max is actually one of the more difficult super-sized phones to handle. That’s partly because it’s marginally wider than the competition at 77.4mm wide, which is 1mm wider than the Note 9 and a full 3.6mm wider than the S9+. But the biggest difference between the iPhone and the rest is Apple’s use of rounded sides.Yes, they look and feel luxurious in stainless steel, but they’re difficult to get a solid grip on with your fingers. Others taper to an edge of some sort along the sides, which gives your fingers purchase.Unless you have abnormally large hands, the iPhone XS Max is therefore almost exclusively a two-handed phone, even with Apple’s reachability, which brings the top of the screen down to the middle – try and use it with one hand at your peril, as this metal and glass sandwich will smash if you drop it.In day-to-day operation it’s not noticeably faster than the iPhone X, which already feels snappy and responsive with iOS 12. But as with other recent iPhone upgrades, the raw power will only likely come into its own with new software, speeding up AR experiences and other bits and pieces behind the scenes.The battery life of the iPhone XS Max was slightly disappointing. It will get through the daylight hours without issue, but it won’t rival the Huaweis of this world. It lasted just over 27 hours between charges, starting at 7am on day one and lasting right through till past 10am on day two.That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix and shooting around 10 or so photos a day. The Lightning connector in the bottom is still the fastest way to charge the phone, with a full charge taking around two hours using an optional fast charger and USB-C cable.For perspective the iPhone X lasted for 30 hours under the same conditions, while last year’s Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro lasted 50 hours. This year’s Samsung’s Galaxy S9+ only lasted 26 hours and the Note 9 only 25 hours, so it seems we’ve taken a step back in battery life in 2018. Apple’s strength is that it pushes software updates to phones for a long time. The iPhone 5S, released in 2013, runs the same version of iOS as the iPhone XS Max.The differences in how they behave come down to the gesture-based navigation that was introduced with the iPhone X last year, and not a lot has changed because iOS 12 concentrated on optimisation over new features.The big addition is a set of wellbeing tools, alongside much better group notifications, which can be dismissed in one go. Siri Shortcuts, an extra app you can download, also allows power-user automation should you want it, setting up custom routines and trigger words you can utter to Siri.One of the downsides with the iPhone XS Max is how little Apple has made of the large screen in software. There’s no split-screen multitasking or anything of that ilk. A few of Apple’s apps have a few more features compared to the smaller iPhone XS.When in landscape there’s a slide-out inbox selector in Mail, chat selector in Messages, Reminders and Contacts get a split-screen view, while Calendar gets an iPad-style Day, Week, Month, Year selector and new view. The Settings app also adopts an iPad-style view in landscape. But these changes aren’t as useful as the enormous wealth of productivity features put into phones with screens this large by Samsung.The dual camera system on the back of the iPhone XS Max has been improved since it first appeared on the iPhone X and 8 Plus last year. It features the same combo of 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle and one with an effective optical zoom of 2x, but both image sensors and algorithms have been updated.The result is markedly better low light performance, which still doesn’t quite beat rivals from Samsung or Huawei, but comes much closer. Detail preservation in images at full crop is also much improved, coming much closer to that of Google’s Pixel 2 XL.The improved HDR mode, which is now on by default, is also better at dealing with high-contrast scenes, meaning shots into the sun and other bright areas are not as much of a problem.Portraits are now noticeably better too, particularly the shallow depth of field effect around hair and other extremities. The bokeh is also now adjustable after the fact, which is fun.The selfie camera is good, but not quite as rich in detailas some rivals. Video is also good, with better stabilisation than previous iPhones.Overall the iPhone XS Max’s camera is rival for the very best in the business.The iPhone XS Max comes in black, silver or gold, costing £1,099 for 64GB of storage, £1,249 for 256GB or £1,449 for 512GB.The iPhone XS Max is big, beautiful and expensive. Its primary selling point is that enormous, gorgeous screen, which is really only useful for watching video or viewing photos.But in maximising the screen, Apple has lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X and its replacement the XS so good. It is much more difficult to handle, heavier and bigger in your pocket.The camera is great, battery life is OK, there’s wireless charging and a myriad of other features. It oozes opulence in a way other smartphones just don’t. But the same can be said of its smaller sibling. And there’s there’s the slightly smaller and cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR arriving later.If you want the biggest iPhone, and can stomach the eye-watering asking price, then this is it. Just try not to drop it.Cons: no fingerprint scanner, very expensive, no fast charger in the box, no headphone socket, massive body This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Over the next three hours, Musk made a series of additional materially false and misleading statements via Twitter.”Explaining the tweet, Musk said he understood Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth was prepared to provide funding to take the company private at a proposed price of close to $420 per share.“This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number’s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend ‘would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.’”Elon Musk said in a statement: “This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.”Tesla and its board told CNBC that they were “fully confident” in Musk after the lawsuit was filed. The SEC, the US’s top financial watchdog, can bring civil actions against a company or its directors and could fine the company. The regulator can also ban executives from being a corporate officer or director of a public company.The SEC suit comes after the entrepreneur has been mired in a series of scandals.

Other things being equal, should I go for an AMD processor with a 128GB SSD or an Intel PC with 8GB of memory, a 1TB HDD and Optane? A comparison of processor performance shows very little difference, and the two options have very similar prices.I typically run a browser with multiple tabs, Acrobat Reader with large pdf files, one or more of the Microsoft Office suite, plus the proprietary software for my business. I don’t do high-end graphics processing or gaming, but would your advice be different if I did? RuthThe difference between the two PCs boils down to how much storage you need and the performance of the Optane accelerator in the Intel-based machine.Most buyers have to choose between expensive but fast SSDs (solid-state drives) and cheaper, slower but much larger HDDs (hard disk drives). I answered this question in June (What is the best laptop drive for students?), providing some background on the different technologies used.Reading it now might help, but to summarise, the best answer for most laptop users is an SSD. Ideally, it should be an M.2 module with NVM Express (NVMe) drivers and controllers, rather than the traditional SSD that fits into a standard drive bay and uses a SATA connection. However, any SSD will do the job well.Desktop PC users have other options, with Optane accelerators being one of the most cost-effective. I use one myself.Basically, Optane provides a high-speed cache between the processor and the HDD. This increases the responsiveness of your PC, giving you close to SSD speeds at HDD prices.Desktop PC users typically want to have masses of data readily available, including decades-worth of documents, photos, music and video files. These won’t fit on an affordable SSD, so desktops often have 1TB or larger HDDs.If you have too much data for an SSD, one option is to fit a second internal hard drive, so make sure the PC you buy has at least one empty drive bay. You can also store data and backups on external hard drives or online, but both are much slower than using an internal drive.The other option is to add an Optane cache to accelerate a traditional hard drive. There are some limitations, but in general, this should outperform a SATA-style SSD in a drive bay. You can get the best of both worlds.Optane is a new type of memory chip developed in secret by Intel and Micron in a partnership that will end next year. They call the technology 3D XPoint (cross point). It might be an example of ReRAM (resistive random-access memory), but don’t quote me on that. It’s certainly different.3D XPoint chips fit into the gap between standard memory chips (RAM) and the Flash memory chips used in SSDs. 3D XPoint chips are slower and cheaper than RAM chips, but dramatically faster and costlier than SSD chips. Over the long term, more advanced 3D XPoint chips will replace RAM chips for some purposes (Intel has already announced 512GB memory modules) and Flash chips for other purposes.Intel sells 3D XPoint devices under the Optane brand label while Micron uses QuantX.Intel has taken the lead partly because it can manufacture processors, support chips and motherboards that work with Optane. Specifically, Optane requires a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core processor, a motherboard with recent Intel support chips (eg Z270 or Z250), Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) V15.5 or later drivers, and a GPT formatted hard drive, not MBR (PDF).The latest version of Optane works with secondary hard drives, not just \u0026nbsp64-bit Windows 10 boot drives. This is a useful step forward. Unfortunately, it requires an eighth-generation Core processor and a motherboard with Intel Series 300 or later support chips. You can buy Optane accelerators and SSDs in the usual places, but getting them to work properly can be another matter. Even if you have a compatible PC, you may need to update the BIOSUEFI firmware and download new drivers. It’s simpler to buy a new desktop PC with Optane pre-installed.Given the price of Optane SSDs, most users will settle for 16GB or 32GB M.2 modules installed as caches, using the Intel management software supplied. The first time you run a program or load data, you won’t see any difference. Loading programs again is extremely fast, because they are being loaded from the Optane cache. In my experience with a 1TB hard drive and a 16GB Optane cache, performance is comparable with a traditional SATA SSD and approaching that of an M.2 SSD, for most normal purposes.Optane chips are “non-volatile” so, unlike RAM chips, they remember whatever they are storing even if you turn the power off.You don’t have to worry about which programs and data are cached because the software manages that automatically.However, you may have problems if you run so many different programs that they won’t fit into the cache available. Someone who runs a lot of multi-level AAA games might well be in that position. Someone who regularly throws 16GB data files around may not see many benefits from Optane, and may suffer slowdowns due to cache swapping.Your use sounds much like mine. I typically run two browsers with around 50 to 250 tabs and one or two Microsoft Office programs, which are lightweights by today’s standards. I also do some photo and video editing. Given my predictable usage, Optane works very well. If I did run into problems, I think I could solve them by swapping the 16GB module for a 32GB version.However, someone who uses very large programs andor large data files might well be better off with a 256GB or larger SSD than a cached hard drive. Also, the more unpredictable you are, the worse it is for any cache.The most cost-effective compromise might be a SATA SSD for the boot disk with an Optane-accelerated secondary HDD. Please comment below if you’ve done that.I admit to being sceptical about Optane memory before I tried it. It wasn’t on my list as a required specification. It just happened to be included in a Dell XPS Core i5-84008GB PC that had the specs I wanted at an attractive price (£699), and I assumed it couldn’t do any harm. If it didn’t work well, I could always install a cheap SSD and use the built-in HDD as a secondary drive. (Yes, Optane will speed up an SSD!)Having used it for 10 months without running into any problems, I can recommend it. However, I haven’t done any serious speed tests. Others have.For example, TweakTown has tested a 32GB Optane cache in great depth, while AnandTech has tested this year’s 64GB module. Both make useful comments.TweakTown and Tom’s Hardware reinforce the point that we don’t spend much time copying sequential files, which is how people often test drive speeds. Most of the time, we’re doing random-access reads. That is where SSDs are at their weakest, and Optane is at its strongest.Have you got a question?

The trials are designed to give the corporation the chance to see how the presenters fare in a live setting similar to that of the flagship BBC1 show.One source said some junior politicians are due to be involved as panellists to ensure that the candidates are given the chance to show their chairing skills in as similar a situation as possible to the real show.Also said to be on the BBC’s shortlist are Maitlis and Husain’s colleagues, Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark and Today programme anchor Nick Robinson.The BBC is also believed to have been interested in ITV News presenter Julie Etchingham, who received plaudits for hosting the rival channel’s leaders’ debate during the general election.According to sources, the BBC will begin the pilots within the next few days, with one source saying next weekend has also been earmarked for further filming.The BBC asked for expressions of interest from candidates before deciding to trial them in order to whittle down the shortlist. It is said to be looking not only for someone with political experience, but someone who has general BBC1 appeal.There have been calls for the corporation to appoint a woman to the role, which would be a first for Question Time since its launch in 1979.Other names that have been mooted during the process include 5Live presenter Emma Barnett, who co-hosts ITV current affairs series After the News, and Victoria Derbyshire, whose BBC News morning show has received plaudits. Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young was also considered a leading candidate until she decided to take a break due to fibromyalgia.Prior to Dimbleby, Question Time was fronted by Robin Day and Peter Sissons.Dimbleby announced in June that he was stepping down as host after 25 years in the role, during which time it has flourished and attracted younger audiences. His final episode will air on 13 December.He has become something of a cult figure during his tenure, attracting parody Twitter accounts and inspiring the name ‘Dimblebot’ and Dimbledance competition online.One insider said: “The BBC has tried to keep the pilots confidential, but that’s difficult when they will have an audience. It’s all become very secretive. But there is pressure to get it right. Whoever steps into David Dimbleby’s shoes knows they are big shoes to fill.”The BBC said it would not comment while the recruitment process was still ongoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78a09b5f2ff9ae12595c9709ac82701d9ea0fe27/0_110_5609_3365/master/5609.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d257910624d30385ccd180525db6eb","title":"sick of it review karl pilkingtons new comedy is more melancholy meditation than shaggy dog stories","story":"In this six-parter, Pilkington plays a fictional version of himself as well as his manifested inner-self, and proves to be more savant than idiotI miss the purity, the simplicity of yesteryear. The days before praline Magnums and “crossushi” (if you don’t know, don’t Google it. It will break you). The days when you could be assured that a president visiting those affected by a devastating hurricane or flood would offer a few sombre, supportive words and not punch the air or lob paper towels into the crowd like a mad carnival barker. When national broadcasters didn’t give hours of airtime to Nazis in the name of balance, when we didn’t break away from international unions without a single, solitary clue what to do next. Those days, you know?Above all, I miss the simplest and purest of all God’s creatures – Karl Pilkington, in the form in which he originally blessed the nation as the idiot savant (with “a head like a fucking orange”) on Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s radio show and podcast The Ricky Gervais Show, which rapidly became Karl’s as well, his implacable gentleness, rambling stories (“The horse was in the lounge. I went in there once because I tried to earn myself some money by flogging little flowers in plastic cups”), gnomic wisdom andor holy foolishness (“I don’t think people should have pets bigger than themselves”) poured forth as naturally and as sweetly as the bird doth sing, won listeners’ hearts and addled our brains. “He’s my angel,” I remember a friend telling me, as she cried with laughter over the show. She was quite high on painkillers at the time, but she had hit on a truth nevertheless. In diclofenac veritas, as they say.Over the next decade or so, pure Pilkingtonism was diffused over a wider area, courtesy of (possibly slightly too) many books and series that sent him, amid small acting roles in various Gervais projects, as An Idiot Abroad to experience the wonders of the world (“I always thought it would be handy to have a volcano close to hand. Just to get rid of old mattresses”) and to reassess his life as a middle-aged man in The Moaning of Life. Mulling over the array of grooming procedures now on offer to the modern man and his nether regions, Pilkington gave what I think can safely be considered the last word on the subject: “I never understood why barbers used to show me the back of my head in a mirror after a quick trim, so I certainly wouldn’t worry about the colour of my anus. I’d say if you’re worrying about the colour of your anus, things must be good, as you can’t have proper worries in your life.”Last night, for the first time, he was trammelled by a script. The new six-part comedy, Sick of It (Sky1), was created and written by Pilkington – who plays a fictionalised version of himself as a west London cab driver, as well as his manifested inner-self, which works a lot more seamlessly than it sounds – and its director Richard Yee.Those who were hoping for a kind of Pilkington showreel – as surely at least part of each of us was, despite everything we know about him militating against him being a showreel-type creator – will have been disappointed. There were no shaggy dog stories bordering on surreal improvisations, or stray thoughts developing like jazz riffs as if testing how far out he can go and still get back. There were, though it pains me to say it, few laugh-out-loud moments, either from single lines or, as is equally common with Pilkington, an accumulation of delights – stupid, stupid delights that suddenly have you falling off your chair in hysterics.What each episode of the opening double bill did have was a minutely worked plot (the first about the sale and removal – and return – of a sofa that represented the 10 years of Karl’s recently ended relationship with his girlfriend, the second involving a crying baby next door) that managed to encompass numerous Larry Sandersesque frustrations at the impossibility of imposing order and logic on human interactions and society, albeit in the far more British register of weary resignation than escalating fury. Whatever the etiquette books say, Karl should try to pick up a woman at his uncle’s funeral, Inner Karl points out, so she would attribute “your naturally miserable face” to the situation. But he doesn’t. The day is spent shifting furniture and discovering the various shortcomings of a shirt-jumper all-in-one, turning the episode into a miniature meditation on the impossibility of ever getting away with anything in life.It may not have been pure Pilkington, but perhaps in these melancholy times we couldn’t cope with that simple, shining joy anyway. Sick of It proves him more savant than idiot and perhaps that is the Pilkington we need today. That angel, with his little orange-like head, always looking out for us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227587bcb84a619d3e1dfa5b0ba7a0b7f1177932/0_5_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=272025c742b17bba92231df55024811b","title":"what brett kavanaugh teaches us about teenage boys and male power","story":"More than 25 years ago, Anita Hill was dismissed as ‘nutty and slutty’ for alleging sexual harassment. Now another supreme court nominee stands accused. Has nothing changed?‘A bit nutty and a bit slutty.” This phrase, used by David Brock in his book The Real Anita Hill, is one I will always remember. Hill was a lawyer, who had acted as an adviser and assistant to the judge Clarence Thomas towards the start of her career she then moved into academe, and when Thomas became a US supreme court nominee in the early 1990s, nominated by the first President Bush, Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment.In October 1991, in publicly televised hearings, she said that Thomas had asked her out socially when she was working as his assistant. She added that he spoke graphically about his sexual prowess, talked about women having sex with animals and pornographic films that showed group sex or rape scenes apparently, he also once asked “Who has put pubic hair on my coke?” after examining a can on his desk.As the judiciary is a branch of the US government, nominees are, in many ways, forced to behave like political candidates, and it was understood that nominations could be “borked” – defeated by any means necessary – the word coming from the blocking of Robert Bork, another rightwinger, in 1987. When Thomas’s nomination was announced – and the Republicans desperately wanted a black conservative, which he was, in the post – Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, declared: “We’re going to bork him.”This was more than 25 years ago. The culture war is not new we go backwards and forwards, and now have another supreme court nominee and more allegations of a sexual nature. But something is shifting. I remember the Hill hearings being shot through with racial and sexual politics. Was this just another hi–tech lynching of a good black man? Hill was accused of being both too poised and also, devastatingly, of being a sexual being. It was his word against hers. I wrote at the time: “For whatever did or did not happen struck a chord with so many women in particular that they felt that what was being told was some emotional truth beyond the comprehension of men in suits.” Others, of course, wrote that only mad, witchy, rad fems believed her at all the columnist Barbara Amiel said, with typical understament: “It seems fair to say that America today, vis-à-vis feminist thought, is at the point Germany reached before the Nazis took over.” Whoa!I wonder what has happened over the years. I wonder, frankly, at my own reticence in not believing Hill to have not clearly connected the sexual harassment she described to my own. Yes, she is speaking an emotional truth I had said, thinking somehow that that might not be the same as an actual truth.Why? Because my own experience and that of my generation involved tolerating a certain level of harassment, quasi-assault and rape as the price we paid for working, travelling, wanting to have a life, to be independent. I always knew that seeking equality was risky. Stuff would happen to you, sexual stuff, slights and outright harassment, and it was a sign of strength that you didn’t complain. The humiliation was internalised. The shame was shoved down the back of your throat. There was little choice about swallowing or spitting. A lot of women swallowed our hurt, but then we found ourselves regurgitating it, often at inappropriate times. I never liked the word trauma: it seemed too dramatic to describe the things men did, or tried to do, to you. We were taught not to be dramatic.When I read Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against Donald Trump’s current supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, it stuck in my throat. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” she has said. Her allegation is that, back in 1982, at a party, when she was 15 and he was 17, Kavanaugh locked her in a room with his friend Mark Judge. Kavanaugh was on top of her and was trying to get her clothes off. Judge allegedly egged him on, and also told him to stop at various points. Kavanaugh was very drunk. Blasey Ford is now a professor. Since the allegation, Deborah Ramirez, who went to Yale with Kavanaugh, has alleged in the New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh thrust his penis against her face when they were both drinking at a college party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and Judge says he never saw Kavanaugh behave in that way.But now another woman, Julie Swetnick, has said she attended “well over 10” house parties in the 80s where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. She said she saw Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behaviour towards girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, ‘grinding’ against girls and attempting to remove or shift girls clothing to expose private body parts”. In addition, she says she saw “efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys …” She herself, she went on to say, was gang raped at a party where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. They have yet to respond to these new allegations.The US president, an unrepentant sexual predator, hasn’t been put off by the earlier allegations against his supreme court pick. Trump has not used the phrase “A bit nutty and a bit slutty“ about Blasey Ford because, apart from anything else, he does not read. But he has dismissed the women who have come forward as drunken, politically motivated Democrats.Let’s be clear: Kavanaugh is not accused of rape and is not in court he may simply not get the job he wants. He wants that job badly enough to have gone on Fox News this week, sitting alongside his concerned-looking wife, and telling us that he was in fact a virgin during his high school years – as if this means he has never disrespected women. His somewhat holier-than-thou persona is, of course, at odds with his yearbook entries these involve him and many of his former classmates slut-shaming a woman called Renate (a large number of them referring to themselves as “Renate alumni”) and alluding to his legendary drinking.It is possible that this man engaged in hardcore frat-boy antics, but never did anything bad to any women. Strangely though, all the things he is accused of are performances for other men, a botched show of sexual prowess and potency. The women concerned are vessels to be exchanged in this cementing of male friendship. This is common enough for it to be ordinary. Just a thing guys do. It will be a rare woman who doesn’t experience a shudder of recognition on reading these allegations, and an instant passport to incidents that occurred in their own teenage years.The rhetorical question that keeps being voiced is: “What boy hasn’t done this in high school?” The idea of pinning a girl down against her will and making her feel she may die is apparently thoroughly normal. The answer to this is surely that a lot of boys haven’t, and never would, that it is not OK now and was not OK in the 70s or 80s, an era now spoken of as unwoke compared with the present, where we know what is and is not acceptable.This is patently rubbish. We know that many teenage girls are wearing shorts under their skirts so as not to be groped at school shots from hardcore porn films are now used as screensavers and girls commonly fear being shamed on social media. We know about the incredibly small chance of a rapist being convicted in this country, and the character assassinations of female accusers. We know that some girls are deemed uncredible. In the UK, the police described certain girls in the Rotherham grooming cases as “unrapeable” children who had blood running down their legs.But it is in the US that we more usually see these high-profile rape trials play out, such as that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman. His father said afterwards that his sentence was: “A steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of 20 years of his life.” A brutal sexual assault was reduced to 20 minutes of action. What did that 20 minutes of action take from the woman who was raped? And what was the sentence that was deemed too harsh? A six-month sentence in county jail, of which he served three months.Even if Kavanaugh did the things he is accused of, does it matter all these years later? Is it possible to be out of control as a young man – and perfectly respectful of women as an older one? It probably is, but it woud require a degree of honesty, a glimmer of self-reflection at least. Instead, Kavanaugh is now involved in some peculiar audition before the US public, in which he is presenting himself as the most perfect young man who ever lived.That this pantomime is being performed while we watch another – a zombie-like Bill Cosby, cuffed and unrepentant, finally being taken to prison – is odd, to say the least. It took the testimony of more than 60 women and many years to bring Cosby down, and still we wonder if he is perhaps too old to be imprisoned. At what age is one beyond justice?Kavanaugh’s alleged “crimes” are small fry compared with Cosby’s. Who will judge the judge at the judiciary hearing on Thursday? Other men, it turns out 11 of them, but with “a female assistant” they have hired for the occasion. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Again, in this story as in so many others, women are wives and assistants. In this ideological battle, even the GOP are uneasy. It just may be that, as has been alleged, Kavanaugh insisted his clerks be pretty, that women look a certain way. Trump does the same. It is the way things always were. It is the way they are now emboldened to be again.Stephen King nailed the boys-will-be-boys mantra. He tweeted that Kavanaugh may have drunk hard and partied heavily: “Those behaviours change with age,” he wrote, “but the attitudes and assumptions which drove those behaviours rarely do.” It seems to me perfectly possible that a man who is now a “carpool dad” did what he has been accused of. If sexual assault was only carried out by monsters, it would not be part of most women’s experience of growing up. This is what #MeToo has revealed. Here, then, we get the push back.Interestingly, many conservative women are unhappy with Kavanaugh, too. They are unsure they understand why women don’t always come forward with accusations of rape and assault. The unease comes when experience and belief systems clash. For any women this is difficult it is easier to shut up and shut down about much of this. The #MeToo movement has opened up a conversation about pain ordinary pain, what so many of us accept as just stuff that happens. We don’t want this for our daughters. That much we do know.So, 27 years on from Anita Hill, we are not yet at the stage of believing women because it is still so uncomfortable even to listen to them. Men will decide if this man is fit to sit on the supreme court and make judgments over what women do with their bodies. If appointed, he will be on the supreme court for life.This man says he behaved honourably, while some of his fellow students remember a belligerent drunk. I don’t know if he put his hand over a woman’s mouth while he was on top of her. I do know too well what that feels like though.This is not only about Kavanaugh. It is about the silencing of women while decisions are made for us – and about us. It is about power God forbid the nutty and the slutty – as all women are ultimately perceived – should speak the truth in these televised hearings. Women voters will watch this though. And they will watch, carefully, the men in charge who get to decide who to believe – and who to silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584c8dc3ab8853c2550705a2d35ddb99a483d7d7/0_24_3372_2025/master/3372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d56234d6249d26ffb2001ca570034058","title":"un security council north korea sanctions china russia pompeo","story":"Countries break from US at session chaired by Mike Pompeo, marking the second setback for the US in as many daysChina and Russia have broken with the US over the maintenance of sanctions on North Korea, arguing they should be relaxed in view of the “positive development of the past few months”.The rift became apparent in a session of the UN security council called by the US and chaired by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. It suggested that the international consensus over North Korea, which had led to a steady escalation of sanctions since 2006, had stalled in the wake of a flurry of summit diplomacy by Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington.The security council foreign ministers meeting on Thursday marked the second diplomatic setback for the US in two days, the day after Donald Trump was roundly rebuffed by other world leaders when he sought to gain support for the reimposition of sanctions on Iran.Pompeo’s task at the security council in maintaining a solidarity over sanctions at a time when the US president has been claiming his summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June represents an historic turning point.In his own introductory remarks, the secretary of state called it “the first significant diplomatic breakthrough in decades”.Kim agreed to the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” at the Singapore summit, but the Pyongyang regime interprets the phrase to mean a drawn-out process of multilateral disarmament, not the unilateral dismantling of the North Korean arsenal.So far it has only begun dismantling a missile engine testing site, which may have become obsolete as North Korean technicians have moved from using liquid fuel to solid fuel for long-range missiles.In supporting Pompeo’s call for maintaining sanctions, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, gave a more modest assessment of the consequences of Singapore, saying: “We note the lack of concrete steps so far.”“Action counts for more than assurances,” Hunt said. “Deeds must follow words.”His Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, backed the call for loosening the sanctions, arguing: “Any negotiation is a two-way street. Steps by the DPRK toward gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"How graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyPersonal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interviewMy career path: Sybil Smyth is a trainee at Deloitte\u0026rsquos tax departmentMy career path: Stephen McGrath works for the property department at LidlGraduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectors"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3643846.1538073449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we had to take a stand mother of incorrect leaving cert points student","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Carter of Castlebridge in Wexford leaves the High Court, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe mother of Rebecca Carter, the student who won a High Court case against the State Examinations Commission after her points were incorrectly counted, has spoken of the big risk the family took to pursue the legal case.The student has been allowed to take up a place in veterinary medicine in UCD after the court directed the commission on Wednesday to correct her points tally by the end of the week.Annmarie Carter said the family had to think long and hard before making the decision to take the case, as it could have had serious financial implications for them“We’re just a normal family, it’s not that we had the means,” she told her local radio station South East Radio.“We sought legal advice and they said to us ‘you have a very strong case for Rebecca, this can go either way, you can win your case and the respondent will pay court fees, you can lose your case and there are serious implications of fees involved.’“We had to think long and hard about that, but we said, you know what if we really believe that we have a case when our legal team did, us as a family, together with Rebecca thought everybody says that’s just the system don’t change it, we decided, Becky has this opportunity now to stand up for her rights and battle it out come what may.“We’ll worry about the money when the time comes, but be under no illusion we do not have millions of euro.”She said her daughter was “phenomenal” and the whole family was so proud of her.“We cannot afford the challenge. We would be in a very different boat had the judge not ruled in Rebecca’s favour, thankfully justice was served.“I don’t know how we would have come up with the money. But that was the risk we had to take. For Rebecca and for future students so that they don’t have to go through what Rebecca went through.”Rebecca herself explained the background to the case to the Morning Mix radio show: “Last year I was 12 points short, which is the equivalent of two per cent because I had received 88 per cent in four of my exams, if any of those had been 90 that would have been those 12 points, this year I was 6 points short of first round offers and then for second round it went down by 5 points, so I was one point short.“I got 554 points in the Leaving Cert, had the mistake not been made I would have received 566 points which surpasses the amount for first round.”She added that in his ruling on Wednesday, High Court judge Mr Justice Richard Humphreys recommended that the SEC change their policy and that the appeal process will be completed before the academic year starts.“Hopefully they will take those recommendations on board so no other student will have to go through what I did, he warned them that he doesn’t want to see them there next year with the same case.”Her mother added that they could understand human error, but they could not understand the bureaucracy of the SEC and why they could not rectify the mistake.“Everybody that we spoke to at the SEC said ‘our hands are tied, we cannot just open the script and take the 10 marks deficit and add it to the front page and increase the grade from a H2 to a H1’.“For everybody else it’s the simplest thing in the world, to say ‘sorry, we made a mistake there’, but it couldn’t be done. They would not do it outside their normal appeal process.”She told of how the previous year her daughter had been 12 points short for veterinary science which was very disappointing after the amount of work she had done.The family said if that was what she was determined to do they would support her but that she would have to “knuckle down for one more year, hard as it is, put the head down and go for it again next year and we supported her throughout the whole year. She’s phenomenal.”Rebecca added that she was fortunate to have accommodation organised.“Hopefully on Monday morning I’ll be sitting in UCD in the lecture hall among the other veterinary first year students.”The past week had been overwhelming and stressful, she said. “It is quite daunting. A lot of the time you don’t understand what’s being said, I had to ask what was happening.“The Judge was quite hard to read, it was difficult to see how it was going, it was only in the last five minutes when he announced his decision that we knew we had won.“Even at that it wasn’t until my Junior Counsel Brendan Hennessy turned around with a big thumbs up to me. In that moment that was when the smile broke out on my face.”Annmarie added: “We’re so proud of Becky for standing up for her rights and her convictions. She truly worked so hard for this moment, she deserves every bit of it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3643988.1538081980!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"company linked to joan freeman funder paid 200m settlement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Joan Freeman: Des Walsh, an Irish businessman living in Los Angeles, and a friend of Ms Freeman, has provided her with a loan of €120,000 to finance her campaign.

The loan is in full compliance with Sipo guidelines, her spokeswoman said.Mr Walsh was president of Herbalife, which describes itself as a “global nutrition company”. He is currently executive vice-chairman, according to US company filings.The company paid $200 million to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a US government consumer protection body, and agreed to restructure its US business operations.According to the FTC complaint, the company’s “compensation structure was unfair because it rewards distributors for recruiting others to join and purchase products in order to advance in the marketing programme, rather than in response to actual retail demand for the product”.The FTC said that Herbalife claimed “that people who participate can expect to quit their jobs, earn thousands of dollars a month, make a career-level income, or even get rich.“But the truth . . . is that the overwhelming majority of distributors who pursue the business opportunity earn little or no money.”Ms Freeman’s campaign declined to comment last night, while Herbalife also did not return a message.Yesterday saw the opening shots fired between candidates in the presidential election, with four of the six contenders participating in a debate on RTÉ radio. President Michael D Higgins and Seán Gallagher did not attend.The four candidates to take part were Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada, Ms Freeman, and businessmen Gavin Duffy and Peter Casey.During the debate, Mr Duffy said he would take the full presidential salary of €325,000 if elected. He was worried about Mr Casey’s suggestion to give it to charity as then in future it would suggest only people like Mr Casey could afford to be president.Mr Casey said he believed there should be a salary, but not one as large as it is, or as large as Mr Duffy wanted it to be.Ms Freeman called for full disclosure surrounding the the unaudited presidential allowance of €317,000. She said she would take the salary, but then donate money to projects, adding that she had done so with her Seanad salary.Ms Ní Riada said she would take a €160,000 ministerial salary. The rest would return to the Exchequer.President Higgins’s spokesman said the president had been “constrained” from taking part in yesterday’s debate due to pre-existing diary commitments.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3644000.1538083088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord presidential candidates get set to be viciously good mannered","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential election candidates in RTÉ studio with presenter Áine Lawlor. Photograph: Julien  Behal The President wasn’t able to attend, citing the commitments of office.Seán Gallagher didn’t attend, citing the President’s absence. If Michael D Higgins wasn’t going, then he wouldn’t be going either. He got himself some commitments too and proceeded to Cavan, there to be among his people.By refusing to join an election debate because the outgoing president wasn’t there, Gallagher instantly relegated the four other candidates to lower-ision status. Let them throw all the shapes they want in their bottom of the table tussle, he only togs out for the big time.Seán operates in the premier, presidential ision. He is the only person of sufficient stature to take over from Michael D in the Arás. He is the First Understudy, and as such, must act as if he already has the part.The remaining candidates were not impressed. Some managed to conceal their irritation better than others. Businessman Peter Casey, who looks a very entertaining prospect, was wonderfully disgusted.But in turning up for the first debate (while acutely aware that the wily Higgins and his team know full well they can pull the presidential duties card to sidestep potentially damaging situations), their response was the right one. It struck the right note – pragmatic, not petulant.Listeners to RTÉ radio’s News at One tuned in to hear what the candidates had to say. Joan Freeman, Liadh Ní Riada, Peter Casey and Gavin Duffy obliged them. They fronted up, said their piece and then faced the questions from Áine Lawlor in the studio and the journalists waiting outside.All four have a vision.All their visions are lovely visions. It would be hard to fall out with any of them.But this is a contest. One which requires iron discipline and a heart of steel, wrapped up in a caring cocoon of empathy and understanding. Under three weeks of saccharine passive-aggressive provocation, some candidates will break. It takes stamina to take down opponents while smiling sweetly and cooing about having a national conversation.The News at One quartet got straight down to business.The current resident of Áras an Uachtaráin, now the (p)resident until the votes are counted, is doing a great job. None of them (except Peter) would say a bad word against him, but they still had plenty of scope to outline how they believe the job could be done differently by a younger, more energetic person who knows the (p)resident has no role in how his office is funded and who pays for his expensive hotel rooms, but you’d wonder all the same, wouldn’t you?Three thousand for a room in Geneva, was it? Not the (p)residents fault, but it’s a lot of money nonetheless.Liadh Ní Riada was the only candidate representing a political party. It is a brand new party called Invisible Sinn Féin.Invisible Sinn Féin is primarily concerned with the issue of Irish unity and a Border poll, and its standard bearer – MEP Ní Riada – has been pushing this line since her candidacy was announced last week. She arrived in RTÉ on her 55-seater battle bus, emblazoned with the pictures of Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill but no mention of the political party they lead.Sinn Féin doesn’t appear on any of the posters either.Gavin Duffy, one suspects, has been spending time standing in front of a full-length mirror perfecting his presidential stance. He has it down to a tee now, face side-profile to the camera, the fingers of his right hand twiddling an imaginary pinkie ring on his left little finger, a la Prince Charles.He did well on Thursday. Steering a bland middle line, avoiding controversy, fiercely conciliatory. He could do well in debates, if he curbs his Michael D tendency towards verbosity.Uber-confident Gavin wants an “evolving presidency” for an “evolving Ireland” and he thinks his wheeze of setting up an international youth corps is “a great idea” and lots of people have told him so. “Voluntourism” suggested Áine Lawlor.Joan Freeman wants to set up a Council of State in every county in Ireland to encourage local people to do local things to improve their locality. A sort of “County of State”. She is an ordinary reflection of ordinary Irish people. She didn’t arrive in a bus, she said, taking a little pot shot at Liadh Ní Riada. “I arrived here in a small white car. I have a mortgage.”Senator Freeman is a leading mental health campaigner who set up Pieta House. Mental Health is the cornerstone of her campaign. When it was pointed out to her that (P)resident Higgins had spoken at length on the issue at an earlier engagement and might he be trying to erode her main campaign pitch, she took no prisoners.“I think I am actually the true person who can talk about mental health in Ireland . . . Look, I’m the expert in this area. I’m sure Michael D is an expert in other areas but this is the most crucial issue facing this country, along with homelessness . . .”Liadh, meanwhile, put her foot in it when asked how she would handle a visit to Ireland by President Donald Trump. First off: “I would ask him about his ridiculous hair.”Afterwards, she had to assert her diplomatic abilities as an MEP and insist it was only a joke.When asked about reports that she wrote to her daughters’ school asking that she not be given the HPV vaccine, her reply was more problematic.“I didn’t write to their school at all. I don’t know where you’re getting your information from,” she told Lawlor.But she said this to Cork local radio at the time two years ago: “I then sent a note into school today with my daughter saying that I didn’t want her to get the vaccine: the HPV vaccine.”But back to Trump. Peter Casey let fly. “Of course, everyone knows he’s a serial womaniser.” He described the US president as a joke of a man, and a disgrace.And while he’s at it, President Higgins is also disgraceful for not turning up to the debate. He ditched the candidates to meet Prince Edward, who is 10th in line to the English throne. Peter said he was disgusted.He loaded up again and took aim at Seán Gallagher, also a “no show”. Gallagher unsuccessfully stood for election last time out. “I mean, he’s been missing in action for seven years,” harrumphed Casey, noting he didn’t materialise again when given the chance by RTÉ.“What has he done in the last seven years other than sue the taxpayer?”Peter thinks the campaign is going to be very clean.Things can only get deliciously worse as everyone becomes more viciously good-mannered.Perhaps one of the candidates should have informed Gallagher that President Higgins already has a Shadow.Síoda, (Irish for shadow) is the (p)resident’s dog. And even more popular than the incumbent.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639697.1537797656!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how ancient dna is transforming history","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA reconstruction of Ötzi the iceman, the 50,000-year-old European found in the Italian alps in 1991.

At Trinity College Dublin, Prof Dan Bradley is a world leader in this emerging field – he has been trying to understand the human past from DNA for the past 25 years. “For years, we had been looking at modern genetic data and trying to understand how population patterns may have come about,” he says. “But compared to ancient human DNA, the problem with modern data is that it can only bring us so far.”Bradley explains it was the case of Ötzi the ice man, one of the first ancient Europeans to have their genome sequenced, which made him realise the power of ancient DNA.“Ötzi’s genome did not resemble people from the Alps today, where he was found, rather it resembled people from Sardinia, ” he says. “It was then that the penny dropped: the genetic structure we see across populations we have today wasn’t always there. That was a big moment.”According to Bradley, a good way to think about human genetics and population patterns is that it’s like looking at the surface of an archaeological site. “What can you tell about the surface?” he asks. “Not so much. It’s not until you start digging down and looking at the layers that you realise what has happened over time. So the real way to understand human genetics and migration is to time travel, and that is what ancient DNA has enabled us to do.”Because of the ancient DNA revolution, we now know that major population changes and migrations happened over time. According to Dr Carleton Jones, a lecturer at the School of Geography and Archaeology at NUI Galway, the displacements of people due to new migrations also had an impact on culture.“Debates about transformative eras involve arguments as to the relative importance of the movement of people, the movement of things, and the flow of ideas,” he says. “Some archaeologists place the emphasis on the movement of people, some place the emphasis on the flow of things and ideas between groups, while other archaeologists fall somewhere between these two extremes. Ancient DNA research is now bringing new data to bear on these questions.”One outcome from the new science is that we now know the people who built the passage tombs at Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth were not the same people we are today. They were replaced by another group who arrived later.“What you find is that there have been huge genome turnovers in Europe, ” says Bradley, “and this extends all the way to our shores. The character of the genome changes over time.”“I think genetics has helped to answer whether cultural change is the spread of ideas or the people themselves, through migration. For example, it looks like the advent of farming in western Europe was accompanied by a very large movement of people.”Given the pace of advances in ancient DNA sequencing, collaboration between archaeologists and geneticists is picking up speed, and is likely to enter a new stage where a lot of the previously assumed truths about culture and anthropology may be overturned. According to Dr Jones, this transition will require caution on both parts. For example, he says anthropological and archaeological studies show us that people and groups construct identities not only based on their actual ancestry they also base identities on imagined ancestries, shared material culture, shared practices, and many other aspects in addition to – and sometimes in contradiction to – actual genetic ancestry.“There are challenges for practitioners in both fields in terms of fully understanding the nature of each other’s data, terminology, and interpretive frameworks,” he says. “These challenges are now starting to be debated in the literature.”Conor Purcell is a science journalist with a PhD in earth science. He also editor of www.wideorbits – some of his other articles at cppurcell.tumblrIn Prof David Reich’s book Who We Are and How We Got Here, published earlier this year, the author argues that ancient DNA has become the most important archaeological tool since radiocarbon dating – the method for determining the age of an object containing organic material. Ancient DNA is helping to build the narrative of ancient people’s lives, not only by looking at human DNA, but also that of their partner-species. According to Prof Bradley, “by understanding the genetics of both humans and the animals they kept, along with the archaeological evidence, we can start building a narrative around these people”.In July 2018, Bradley and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Science, where they established that, through the domestication of goats 8,000 years ago, human societies forced evolutionary selection for goat traits, including pigmentation and stature.“Cattle, sheep, goats and dogs are our partner species,” he says, “and they tell us a lot about the past, especially the process of domestication alongside the beginning of agriculture.”“In the future, I think ancient animal DNA will tell us a lot more about human society, including phenomena like trade and the ancient economy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

which are meant to be earmarked for supporting the most vulnerable pupils - to prop up the school\u0027s overall budget. All of this is compounded by difficulties in recruitment and retention of teaching staff, they add. We respectfully request that you do not take us for fools and reply by using partial information and half-truths in order to avoid taking the remedial actions that are so urgently needed, the letter says. Our concerns are so serious that headteachers have travelled in massive numbers from all over England to deliver our message in person.Britain\u0026#39s Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip HammondHeads have been told to dress well for the event with the march’s organisers reminding them: “We should maintain our relentlessly reasonable approach and even things like dressing formally on the day are important.”Jules White, headmaster of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, west Sussex, who organised the march said the scale of revolt is unprecedented, and is a last resort after years of their pleas for funding falling on deaf ears. Describing himself as an “average middle aged, middle class headteacher”, Mr White insisted that the heads protesting this Friday are “not some group of politically motivated radicals”, adding that no unions or organisations were involved in planning the protest. He said the idea initially gained traction with fellow home counties headteachers, and then with heads around the rest of England. He said that headteachers across England are fundamentally hamstrung, and told of his frustration when ministers claim that “we’ve never had it so good” yet schools across the country have faced years of real terms cuts. He said that after years of writing to Education Secretaries and holding meetings with local MPs and ministers, headteachers feel they have not got any closer to securing adequate funding. In December 2016, the then Education Secretary Justine Greening unveiled a New Funding Formula, which gave hope to rural schools after it promised to end an “unfair, opaque and outdated” funding system that favoured children in London over those in the countryside.Justine Greening, the former education secretaryBut since all funding was capped at three per cent, it later transpired that this formula did little to lift struggling schools out of financial problems, Mr White said. Dr Robin Bevan, headmaster of Southend High School for Boys, a grammar school, said he and his colleagues are deeply infuriated. These are not heads who are used to going on protest marches, or who are accustomed to striking, he said. These are heads from respected suburban schools, you have a form of activism coming out of middle class home counties.It is the headteacher equivalent of the Arab Spring, the same kind of awakening – we have used all the modern technologies that make getting in touch very easily.Earlier this month, the Department for Education (DfE) updated their staffing and employment advice for schools document to remind teachers that it is inappropriate to share “political views” with pupils. It came after headteachers were criticsed during last year’s general election, which saw thousands of leaders write to parents over the state of school funding.Dr Bevan said heads were not trying to be political, but felt compelled to act out of a sense of public duty.He said there are a series of classic symptoms of struggling schools: first, there is a reduction in support staff and next comes larger classes.We have increased class sizes in the GCSE years by about 15 per cent and at A level by 30 per cent, he said.The step after that – which is beginning to happen – is you see subjects disappearing, first at A level and then at GCSEs. Its subjects like music, art and languages which tend to have small classes.“We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the £10 billion spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds.” Prominent Tories rally to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit planBreast cancer deaths set to rise as unhealthy lifestyles roll back decades of progressGovernment crackdown could end £900-a-year household bills rip offComment: Brett Kavanaugh offers a win for Trump\u0026#39s culture war.

The future is not about closure, but openness.”Michaela Biancofiore, an MP for the centre-Right Forza Italia party, said the new law promoted “ a new kind of apartheid” and she planned to appeal to the European Parliament to change it.“This initiative will bring the real estate sector to its knees and homeowners will be forced to sell,” she said. “It will cause enormous damage to residents.”A council statement named the 25 towns and 26 villages would be affected by the new law which was passed by the council in July, and went into effect this week.  Dozens of regions have been declared off-limits to outsidersRegular checks will be carried out on second homes to ensure the law is being upheld.  In towns and villages where the number of second homes exceeds 10 percent, 100 percent of new or converted homes will be reserved for residents, the council said.  With its Gothic churches, German street signs and restaurants filled with apple strudel and wiener schnitzel, South Tyrol seems the least Italian part of Italy.  Bolzano is just 70 miles from the Austrian border and two thirds of the population in South Tyrol speak German. Many residents have never accepted the region’s annexation from the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1919 at the end of the Second World War.  Federico Guiglia, journalist for the Venetian daily Il Gazzettino, criticised the move as a ploy to gain votes ahead of regional elections in October and questioned why the council had not applied it to all 116 municipalities in the province.  “It applies to the high tourist density municipalities with the most beautiful places that are visited,” he said.   There were also concerns that the law may be in breach of the Italian Constitution but Mr Theiner said the national government had examined the new provincial law and decided not to challenge it before the constitutional court.  Please review our commenting policyProminent Tories rally to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit planBreast cancer deaths set to rise as unhealthy lifestyles roll back decades of progressGovernment crackdown could end £900-a-year household bills rip offComment: Brett Kavanaugh offers a win for Trump\u0026#39s culture war.

Hence the cheering from the sadly limited number of people in Theresa May’s Britain that have sufficient spare cash to salt some away.\u0026nbspAnother point in the account’s favour is that it is a truly mass market product, available to anyone aged 18 and above with a minimum deposit of just £1.\u0026nbspSing it loud, sing it proud: Let’s go Goldman’s! Or should that be: Let’s go Marcus! \u0026nbsp“There is a real disillusionment about savings,” said Marcus MD Des McDaid. “We want to reverse the trend - literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Get you to Saville Row to have a pair of underpants fitted that you can wear above your suit Des! You’re the new savings Superman!\u0026nbsp“More competition in the savings market is sorely needed,” said Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform in response.\u0026nbspJust how true that statement is can been seen if you consider one of the numbers put out by Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s biggest retail bank.\u0026nbspNet interest margin is, in simple, terms the difference between what borrowers pay and what savers are paid. At Lloyds it hit a low of 1.91 per cent in the second quarter of 2012. In the early part of 2018, however, it had improved to a balmy 2.93 per cent.\u0026nbspNow the number encompasses\u0026nbspall of the various ways Lloyds funds its various lending activities (so corporate deposits, current accounts, wholesale funding etc). It isn’t limited to retail savings accounts and loans.\u0026nbspBut you don’t get to juice your margins like that when you’re operating in a vibrantly competitive savings market.\u0026nbspSo yay Goldman. Up to a point. Because you won\u0027t be surprised to learn that, this being banking, there is\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcatch.For a start, as Suter points out, the account pays\u0026nbspjust 0.09 per cent more than current table-topper Yorkshire Building Society, good for an extra 90p a year for someone with £1,000 on deposit. Some people might think it’s worth giving that up to save with a building society they own a piece of in preference to Goldman. ​Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The cars’n’cycles chain today unveiled a swanky new long term strategy designed to transform it into a “service led super specialist”.\u0026nbspIf that statement doesn’t qualify for a “crikey!” or even a “corky o’reilly!” I’m not sure what does.\u0026nbspBut there’s more. The retailer says it is preparing to offer a “differentiated, super specialist, shopping experience” that will “inspire and support a lifetime of motoring and cycling”. Wow! I’m not sure quite what that means but Wow!Halfords half-year profit knocked back by Brexit-hit poundHalfords posts solid sales thanks to UK staycation boom Cycle slump puts the brakes on Halfords’ growthThe thing is, it isn’t just mere hyperbole married to corporate gibberish. CEO Graham Stapleton has promised to put the company\u0027s money where his mouth is.\u0026nbspAs part of its “capital markets day” he announced plans to invest £20m a year on top of the existing £40m a year of capital expenditure Halfords had told its investors to expect.That part went down like a lead balloon in the City because analysts had to cut their profit forecasts. Shareholders will have to accept flat profits for a couple of years with only “mid single digit growth” after that.\u0026nbspYou have to sympathise with Mr Stapleton a bit. The world’s most successful companies get there by investing heavily in their businesses.\u0026nbspPart of the reason that Britain has so few among their number is that its top companies have a dismal record when it comes to doing that, and it’s partly because of the short termism that dominates in the City.\u0026nbspThe UK would arguably be in\u0026nbspbetter economic shape if a few more CEOs were willing to stand up to it by telling their investors that it takes money to make money.\u0026nbspHalfords won’t be in any sort of shape if it isn’t prepared to spend a bit on coping with a new reality that requires companies with bricks and mortar stores to offer more than they used to to tempt customers away from the web. That more is service. \u0026nbspBut you can also understand the City’s scepticism. This is Halfords, after all, and there aren’t many who would describe it as one of the world’s most successful businesses.\u0026nbspIt has spent too much time driving in the slow lane while cycling through CEOs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The group has seen profits shrink and struggled to shift stock in recent years due to competition from both those brands, as well as high-street rivals such as Primark. However, the company reassured investors on Thursday that it would not need to cut costs to move unsold clothing in spite of the quarterly dip in profit, and shares in H\u0026ampM rose more than 11 per cent. \u0026nbspThe fashion company’s CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said: “The rapid changes in the fashion industry are continuing and the H\u0026ampM group is in an exciting transitional period. Our transformation work has contributed to a gradual improvement in sales development with increased market share in most markets during the third quarter, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.Autistic boy becomes H\u0026ampM model after he was banned from school pictureH\u0026ampM is launching a lingerie collection with Love StoriesH\u0026ampM accused of failing to ensure fair wages for global factory workers“In the US, France, Italy and Belgium, however, store sales were negatively impacted by the problems that arose when we introduced new logistics systems in these markets. The new logistics systems are an essential part of our work to make our supply chain faster, more flexible and more efficient, and to continue the integration of stores and online.”As of May this year, H\u0026ampM had 4,801 stores in 69 countries and is looking to expand its reach even further.In its nine-month report, the company announced that Uruguay will become a new store market in Autumn 2018 and that contemporary fashion brand COS (part of the H\u0026ampM group) will launch online in China in Autumn 2018 as well.The fashion brand has also recently launched new brand Afound both in stores and online in Sweden. Meanwhile, the retailer is revamping its Swedish stores after being criticised for its cluttered environment. The company created a pilot store in Stockholm with a smaller range of clothes on show and an airier design, which features invitation-only events and where customers can order coffees while they shop. H\u0026ampM was recently accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair “living wage”.The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) said the group had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.However, the Swedish company said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.A spokeswoman for H\u0026ampM said: “There is no universally agreed level for living wages, and wage levels should be defined and set by parties on the labour market through fair negotiations between employers and workers representatives, not by Western brands.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The offered rate is around three times better than the average rate among existing accounts available to savers. The banking giant said the account is “transparent, secure, and easy to use”. It launched for Goldman Sachs employees in August, and is now available to UK residents over the age of 18. Savers can deposit from £1 to £250,000. Which banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Business groups warn interest rate hike poses threat to UK economyGoldman Sachs launches retail bank Marcus in UKDes McDaid, managing director at Marcus by Goldman Sachs said: “Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We’ve spoken in-depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings –\u0026nbspwhile most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame.“We want to reverse the trend – literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Mr McDaid added: “We’ve made the Marcus Online Savings Account as easy as possible to open and manage online, and with our aim to offer a consistently competitive interest rate, we hope our customers will see the benefits – and how, over time, this can add up to help them get to their saving goals that bit quicker.”Goldman Sachs hired 150 extra staff this year ahead of the launch of Marcus. Shakila Hashmi, head of money at Compare the Market, said: “Goldman Sachs’ entrance into the mainstream of retail banking should be good news for savers. The rate offered on its first UK savings account is around three times more generous than the average savings accounts from the major players.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The group has seen profits shrink and struggled to shift stock in recent years due to competition from both those brands, as well as high-street rivals such as Primark. However, the company reassured investors on Thursday that it would not need to cut costs to move unsold clothing in spite of the quarterly dip in profit, and shares in H\u0026ampM rose more than 11 per cent. \u0026nbspThe fashion company’s CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said: “The rapid changes in the fashion industry are continuing and the H\u0026ampM group is in an exciting transitional period. Our transformation work has contributed to a gradual improvement in sales development with increased market share in most markets during the third quarter, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.Autistic boy becomes H\u0026ampM model after he was banned from school pictureH\u0026ampM is launching a lingerie collection with Love StoriesH\u0026ampM accused of failing to ensure fair wages for global factory workers“In the US, France, Italy and Belgium, however, store sales were negatively impacted by the problems that arose when we introduced new logistics systems in these markets. The new logistics systems are an essential part of our work to make our supply chain faster, more flexible and more efficient, and to continue the integration of stores and online.”As of May this year, H\u0026ampM had 4,801 stores in 69 countries and is looking to expand its reach even further.In its nine-month report, the company announced that Uruguay will become a new store market in Autumn 2018 and that contemporary fashion brand COS (part of the H\u0026ampM group) will launch online in China in Autumn 2018 as well.The fashion brand has also recently launched new brand Afound both in stores and online in Sweden. Meanwhile, the retailer is revamping its Swedish stores after being criticised for its cluttered environment. The company created a pilot store in Stockholm with a smaller range of clothes on show and an airier design, which features invitation-only events and where customers can order coffees while they shop. H\u0026ampM was recently accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair “living wage”.The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) said the group had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.However, the Swedish company said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.A spokeswoman for H\u0026ampM said: “There is no universally agreed level for living wages, and wage levels should be defined and set by parties on the labour market through fair negotiations between employers and workers representatives, not by Western brands.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed. But if not it can be found by heading into the Settings app, scrolling down to Screen Time, and following the instructions that are found there.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The offered rate is around three times better than the average rate among existing accounts available to savers. The banking giant said the account is “transparent, secure, and easy to use”. It launched for Goldman Sachs employees in August, and is now available to UK residents over the age of 18. Savers can deposit from £1 to £250,000. Which banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Business groups warn interest rate hike poses threat to UK economyGoldman Sachs launches retail bank Marcus in UKDes McDaid, managing director at Marcus by Goldman Sachs said: “Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We’ve spoken in-depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings –\u0026nbspwhile most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame.“We want to reverse the trend – literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Mr McDaid added: “We’ve made the Marcus Online Savings Account as easy as possible to open and manage online, and with our aim to offer a consistently competitive interest rate, we hope our customers will see the benefits – and how, over time, this can add up to help them get to their saving goals that bit quicker.”Goldman Sachs hired 150 extra staff this year ahead of the launch of Marcus. Shakila Hashmi, head of money at Compare the Market, said: “Goldman Sachs’ entrance into the mainstream of retail banking should be good news for savers. The rate offered on its first UK savings account is around three times more generous than the average savings accounts from the major players. As such, we would expect a high degree of interest in switches to the Marcus account in the coming weeks.“Our hope is that this is a catalyst for other banks to offer better rates to their customers. The effect it will have on competition is not simply that of another new player coming into the market and offering an attractive rate Goldman Sachs is a well-known name, albeit an unlikely one in the retail banking space. Its arrival in this market is highly visible and, essentially, throws down the gauntlet to the rest of the industry.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Never mind either, that it has provided employment to thousands of broadcast professionals and forced other media outlets to up their game. And never mind that the advent of subscription TV has, in turn, pumped vast amounts of money back into football and other sports.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Indeed, for Murdoch’s critics (haters, in some cases), the success of Sky is somehow a further reason to knock him. Opponents perceive in Sky News the political bias that is obvious – and permissible – in Murdoch’s newspaper empire, although there is no real evidence to back the claim. What’s more, the issue of paying to watch sport remains inherently isive: would interest in cricket have declined in the last decade or so if the masses could still watch it on Channel 4 or the BBC?Whatever your view on Murdoch, however, the prospect of him no longer having any stake in Sky – which he launched in 1989 – feels momentous. Few might have guessed nearly three decades ago that the subscription broadcaster would become the monolith that it is today. The auction for control of the company, won by Comcast on Saturday, valued Sky at £30bn – which is enough for a lot of satellite dishes.As such, even if UK-based TV could never provide a platform for political rhetoric in the way that a newspaper can, Murdoch’s influence in the wider media industry will be weakened by his exit from Sky.Nevertheless, it would be premature to conclude that we’ve seen the last of him. Murdoch may be 89-years-old but there is little to suggest he is any less engaged with his businesses – and especially with his newspapers – than in previous times. What’s more, without Sky to worry about, this titan of media titans may feel he can devote his entire focus to the elements of his empire which remain. For those in senior editorial roles at The Sun in particular, that may be quite a thought.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopWe are at present six months away from Brexit (in theory), with debate about our mode of departure (and a possible second referendum) raging. Murdoch’s view on that issue seems fairly clear as does his position on the potential of Jeremy Corbyn forming a new government.The influence of inidual newspaper on elections and on major policy issues is debatable. But, with Sky behind him, Murdoch may believe the time has come to once again turn up the heat from The Sun.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And it gives some clue about how they lived.That huge number of people would need some degree of agricultural intensification to be able to sustain themselves. The data seems to show that\u0026nbspthe wetlands throughout the region were heavily modified for agricultural use.And the new findings show that there was a large-scale network of roads that connected cities and towns that were distant from each other. Some of those roadways were heavily fortified, the authors found to their surprise.That substantial investment shows not only how connected Mayan cities were, but also the scale of Mayan warfare.The new research, which was funded by the Guatemalan government, is published in\u0026nbspScience.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

Speaking to reporters outside the organisation’s Berlaymont headquarters he said Labour was “not negotiating” with the EU.We’re obviously not negotiating, we’re not in government“We’re obviously not negotiating, we’re not in government, we’re the opposition, but it was interesting to note what our views are and the six tests that we’ve laid down by which we will hold our government to account in the future,” he said.He added: “We set out the views of the Labour party on issues surrounding Brexit following the conferences speeches made by both Keir Starmer and myself.”But the meetings come just 24 hours after he told Theresa May that if she could not reach a deal with Brussels, Labour would step in.Ahead of the meeting a spokesperson for the European Commission said he was not aware whether Mr Selmayr would be meeting with Mr Corbyn.\u0026nbspAsked whether he was scared of Mr Selamyr, European Commission chief spokesperson Margaritas Schinas says: “Martin is a friend for many years and we have a relation that goes beyond fear, hope… it’s respect, to each other.”Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

And what are the options for the country’s relationship with Europe if it exists outside that market?The European single market is the most ambitious part of the whole “European project”. It aims to break down all barriers to trading across the 500 million-person area by ensuring the “four freedoms”, sacrosanct to Brussels policymakers: free movement of goods, services, capital and – most controversially -\u0026nbsplabour.As an\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspmember, the UK has signed up to each of those freedoms which, as Brussels has repeatedly made clear, are non-negotiable.Being part of the single market gives UK businesses unfettered access to 500 million customers in all states within it and in turn allows UK consumers and companies to purchase goods and services from across the continent. It eliminates tariffs and reduces costs and administrative burdens by applying one set of rules across all member states.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The prime minister has repeatedly said\u0026nbspthe UK will not maintain full access to the customs union but has so far been unable to secure\u0026nbspan agreement on what form the new relationship might take.No. The single market is governed by reams of legislation that aims to harmonise rules on everything from maximum working hours to what tackling climate change. Contrary to popular myth, no EU rule has ever banned excessively curved bananas\u0026nbsp(though standards for fruit quality are laid out in Commission Regulation 225794).Without following unified standards, the single market ceases to be a single market as any one country can implement their own rules.\u0026nbspIt is possible to stay in the single market but be outside of the customs union, as the European Economic Area countries (Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein) do. This allows them to negotiate their own trade deals and to opt out of some legislation, notably fishing quotas. However, they still have to implement all EU laws relating to the operation of the single market, including free movement of people.A huge 44 per cent of Britain’s exports go to the EU – £220bn out of £510bn – according to the Office of National Statistics. If the UK did not negotiate a favourable trade deal with the EU, those exports would be subject to import tariffs as well as extra administrative costs.In the period before any new deal was implemented, the UK would probably have to trade on standard tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules.An analysis by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspfound that the cost to Britain’s exporters – in extra tariffs alone -\u0026nbspwould be at least £4.5bn per year. This conservative estimate does not include the difficult-to-measure costs of non-tariff barriers, such as the enforcement of different market standards and regulations.It is possible for the UK to have\u0026nbspaccess\u0026nbspto the single market without being a member of it, or being part of the customs union. The UK could negotiate a deal with the EU that allows access to trade freely with the bloc. The EU has 56 free trade agreements with countries around the world, and is in the process of negotiating several more.What is the customs union and what would leaving it mean?On the face of it, this sounds like the option most amenable to many Leave voters, but it is not the simple solution it may first appear.First, when negotiating the terms of that deal, the power balance is tipped heavily in the favour of the EU – the biggest customs union in the world by economic output. Therefore it is likely that the UK would have to agree to adhere to most of the rules that apply as a member state if it wants to trade with it. As a non-EU member it would lose the ability to influence that legislation.Ms May’s has previously warned\u0026nbspthat it would be a “calamitous act of self-harm” for the EU to scupper a free trade pact with the UK by pushing for punitive terms. As the smaller partner, it is likely the UK would be more damaged.\u0026nbspIn addition, such deals can take years to negotiate as all EU member states have to agree to any deal. The recent\u0026nbspEU-Canada trade deal\u0026nbsptook seven years to agree.Once implemented, the UK’s imports to the single market would still have to adhere to a lot of that much-maligned and misunderstood “red tape”.What are the positives about leaving the single market and customs union?The main change would be that the UK would not have to sign up to the free movement of labour.\u0026nbspImmigration\u0026nbsphas been the most isive Brexit issue of all and clearly a large number of people voted to leave in order to see it reduced.Others have pointed out that large parts of the economy and the NHS\u0026nbspare hugely reliant on inward migration.Outside the EU, the country would have the power to limit the number of migrants entering the country. The government has given little detail as to how it would deal with immigration to ensure that businesses can still recruit people with the skills they need.A “points-based” system has repeatedly been mooted, though there are scant examples from other countries of this working effectively in practice.The UK will also not have to follow some EU laws, but it will have to sign up to many standards if it wants access to the single market via a trade agreement.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The paper tracked down residents of the village where Colonel\u0026nbspAnatoliy\u0026nbspChepiga\u0026nbspapparently spent much of his youth. Locals said they recognised “Tolya” (short form of\u0026nbspAnatoliy) in the UK police photos and much-ridiculed RT interview. \u0026nbsp“Many people look like one another”“It’s\u0026nbspTolya, one hundred percent. His near-black eyes, and his voice,” said one woman, who refused to be identified.\u0026nbspWhen the Kremlin eventually broke cover on Thursday evening, it was to deny knowledge of anything to do with the\u0026nbspGRU\u0026nbspcolonel.\u0026nbspIn a tense session with journalists, spokesman\u0026nbspDmitry\u0026nbspPeskov\u0026nbspsaid he did “not have the information” to confirm or deny the man that UK police identified as\u0026nbspRuslan\u0026nbspBoshriov\u0026nbspwas, indeed, Colonel\u0026nbspAnatoliy\u0026nbspChepiga.\u0026nbsp“We don’t have any other data,” he said. “We see there has been an informal investigation. We don’t know if it is true, or how much it is true.”\u0026nbspBesides, he added, “many people look like one another.”novichok poisoning caseMr\u0026nbspPeskov\u0026nbspclaimed to have only come across the information when the report was published on Wednesday. He could not confirm why a military officer by the name of\u0026nbspChepiga\u0026nbspreceived Russia’s highest military award.The spokesman indicated the Kremlin had little interest in a comprehensive discussion of the subject. After speaking out in defence of “two ordinary civilians”, the president is also unlikely to voluntarily return to the issue.\u0026nbsp“Putin understands it was an egregious mistake of information policy to speak in the way that he did,” says former Kremlin advisor\u0026nbspGleb\u0026nbspPavlovsky. The president’s ill-advised intervention had only fuelled the scandal: “Before there was only Theresa May speaking. Putin voluntarily offered up a protocol equivalent.”Mr Pavlovsky suggests the Russian president had been motivated by an “elevated sense of self-worth”, and a belief his words would be enough to change things.\u0026nbsp“He will not be making the same mistake again,” says Mr Pavlovsky.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspsystem strives to escalation and radicalisation. It answers escalation with escalation.” \u0026nbspThe scale of the intelligence blunders is likely to have wide-reaching\u0026nbspconsequences for Russia’s intelligence services. A shake-up in personnel seems inevitable. This is unlikely to happen immediately, however. Mr Putin’s HR policy is usually conservative and detached from news events.\u0026nbspBut when it happens, things could get ugly, says Alexei Filatov, a retired security services officer.\u0026nbsp“If it turns out to be as the investigation says it was, then lord help us, honours will be flying off people’s uniforms, and people will be fired,” he told The Independent. “It would be a shame since the\u0026nbspGRU\u0026nbspis a decorated institution with a great history.”\u0026nbspMr Filatov said he could not confirm the veracity of the\u0026nbspBellingcatInsider report. Nonetheless, their conclusions “looked more convincing and well argued than those presented by our Foreign Ministry”.\u0026nbspThe former agent says Russia’s intelligence agencies may also been undone by technological advance: “It is like a mine – we’re discovering new layers of information that previously people thought didn’t exist. It may be impossible to hide all the information.”\u0026nbspBut as embarrassing as the leaks have been, they are unlikely to lead to a root-and-branch reform of the political system.\u0026nbspIf anything, radical politicians will feed off the scandal, says Mr Pavlovsky.\u0026nbsp“I’m afraid our leaders like it when the west writes terrible things about them,” he says. “The\u0026nbspsystem strives to escalation and radicalisation. It answers escalation with escalation.” \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

thunderstorm.\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg said: The Prime Minister is of course a Brexit supporter and a supporter that\u0026nbsp Brexit means Brexit.But to be frank I agree a lot with Rod\u0027s

tied to the EU rulebook.The Prime Minister belives in Chequers and I want her to change her policy and I think inevitably her policy will change because it has no supporters.11.10pm: Polly Mackenzie

it would be wrong in voting on what way we sgiykd leave.Jacob Rees-Mogg answered that we know that we are leaving, which does not mean Chequers or remaining in the EEA.\u0026nbspHe said: All these matters should come to a General Election.11.00pm: New question:\u0026nbspif you say we want a second referendum, does it no go against the Labour manifesto from last year?Jacob Rees-Mogg answered the second question from the audience saying the UK should crack on and leave the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspMr Rees-Mogg insited that the job of the opposition is to oppose and opposition parties always want another General Election.He claimed that actually there is a smallish group of people who don\u0027t want Brexit, adding: I don\u0026rsquot think the British people will fall for that.I think we should say the decision has been taken.Frankly I think we should crack on and leave as soon as possible.10.55: Rod Riddle says we will have another second referendum only if Corbyn becomes

It also revealed that only around one in 10 Democrats expect the US President to be re-elected.Lord Ashcroft said if the Democrats\u0026rsquo direction is set by their most committed activists, \u0026ldquowe know from previous research those activists are far removed in terms of values and outlook from the kind of voters who deserted the party in the Midwest two years ago.He added it would be \u0026ldquobrave of the Democrats to continue to turn their back on those voters and not try to win them back.But Lord Ashcroft, who resigned as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in in September 2010 after nearly five years in the role, warned the Democratic path is starting to mirror that of the Labour Party in the UK nearly a decade ago.In 1997, Labour defeated the Conservatives with a 179 seat majority that saw Tony Blair become Prime Minister for eight years, before stepping down and being replaced by Gordon Brown in 2005.Lord Ashcroft\u0027s poll shows one in 10 Democrats expect Donald Trump to be re-elected (Image: )Nearly half of Democratic voters think the party\u0027s  (Image: LORD ASHCROFT POLLS)But after 13 years in power, Labour were defeated by the Conservatives in the 2010 general election, when the Tories formed a coalition Government with the Liberal Democrats.Labour has remained out of power since and Lord Ashcroft claimed they leant more to the left when Ed Miliband took over as the party\u0026rsquos leader eight years ago.According to a national poll by YouGov from September 24-25, the Conservatives polled 42 percent of the vote compared to Labour\u0026rsquos 36 percent - it\u0026rsquos biggest lead so far this year.Lord Ashcroft warned the Democrats could find themselves cast into political shadows like Labour if they continue to lean to the left.He said: \u0026ldquoAfter the Labour landslide of 1997, it took the Conservatives eight years to take the hint and start making the changes they needed.

Then, on August 2018 his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story...Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the 2010 General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the 1997 General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram.He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May 2018 it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £5million house just around the corner from No 10 Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.It happened on August 1, 2018 when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs 17th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £5.6m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted that  he ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £5million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.Mr Rees-Mogg added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Chelsea star and this years Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star said elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the 23-year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do you remember the front page of a popular British daily calling the judges the ‘enemy of the people’?Or just last week, the EU leaders were called ‘dirty rats’ on another front page.Almost daily we could find examples of stories that are spiced up to point out the enemy, to paint the picture black and white.I would advocate for a European approach to media based on quality and smart regulation,  needed.But Tory MEP Amjad Bashir said: “Commissioners should not be trying to shackle the Press.“We politicians do not always like what journalists write, but they have to be free to report the news as they see it.The vibrancy and iety of our newspapers is one of the things that makes Britain great.People have to learn to take the rough with the smooth.Otherwise we are on a slippery slope to state control and oppression.Mr Bashir’s colleague Ashley Fox added: “A free and unfettered media is vital.” EU officials insisted there was no new legislative action in the pipeline in terms of media regulation and that Ms Jourova had been talking about broadcasters.A Commission spokeswoman said she was merely trying to “trigger a discussion”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I’ve got no objection to that. But you still have to keep asking yourself — where is the money coming from?And on Brexit? Scarcely a word. The most important issue facing the country right now and Labour had next to nothing to say about it.But we know they’re planning to support a second referendum on the issue. Selling down the river the millions of Labour voters who thought we were best out of the European Union.At first, Labour — with great principle — stuck to the decision of the referendum.Not now they see a chance of power, the prospect of hoovering up all those votes from Remainers who think we got it wrong two years ago. There is great inequality in our country. Low wages and poor standards of living in many parts.

that little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at

It was a pair of gay males who had snatched it and was stood with it.”Sandie said she believed the mum had gone for her daily bath and when she did not  in time for the dad appeared to have forgotten all about his parental responsibilities and left the baby alone.She added: “When they saw him alone they probably thought ‘that’s too bad, we’ll snatch it.It was thought the mum and dad would  and claim their chick back, but that did not immediately happen.  Eventually they did come looking for it and it was decided to give them custody of the bird.Seemingly scandalised by the sight, the Edwardian scientist described the behaviour as depraved.

It also appears to show speeding is not seen as dangerous by courts.”Angry parents took to Facebook to slam dad-of-four Beckham as a “bad role model” for their kids.One wrote: “If he’d hit a child at that speed it would have died.

He had no involvement whatsoever in this offence.Beckham made his name as a midfielder at Manchester United in the 1990s before going on to play for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.He also earned 115 caps for the national side.District Judge Barbara Barnes rejected the claim that notice was served on time, and cleared Beckham of the driving offence on the legal technicality.She said: What I find is that it did not arrive in the post-room at Bentley Motors Limited until February 7 and that therefore by one day was just outside of the required legal limit.As a result of my finding then the defendant in this case cant be convicted.Beckham retired from playing in 2013.Beckham and his we, former Spice Girl Victoria have built up a multi-million pound empire through Victorias fashion house, clothing lines with retailers and product endorsements.WE’LL be blunt, Becks.It is repugnant to see a celebrity smugly dodge justice solely thanks to being rich enough for a fancy lawyer skilled at exploiting loopholes.Especially when that star freely admits doing 59mph in a 40 zone.Millions of ordinary people grimly suck up fines they can ill afford for far lesser speeding offences.Even  their prosecution letter arrives a day late.Beckham may be within the letter of the law, but not its spirit.That’s a bad look for a man desperate for public adulation and establishment approval"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436830308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emmanuel macron reverse brexit second referendum","story":"The French president even suggested a re-run of the referendum might be necessary because voters didnt grasp how complex the issue was when they backed Brexit two years ago.Mr Macron insisted he didnt want to meddle in British politics - despite saying hed love to have the UK back in the EU.Asked  European leaders would welcome Britain back after a second referendum, he told Bloomberg: For sure.He denied that he secretly wants the UK to leave so Paris can grab business from the City, saying: This is about history, not about domestic interests.But Mr Macron added: Im not the one to decide such a move and I do respect the choice of British voters.So I dont want to interfere in this debate about a second referendum and so on.He also took aim at the Leave campaign which won the 2016 referendum - suggesting Brits had been misled by politicians such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.The president said: It costs a lot, it’s much more complicated than they initially thought.Mr Macron has come under fire from Brexit campaigners for his efforts to overturn the referendum.And hes accused of deliberately setting out to punish the UK for quitting the EU in the hope of turning voters against Brexit.The ex-Home Secretary insisted No Deal would be such a disaster that shed rather see a peoples vote instead.She has previously been fiercely loyal to the PM - and is a firm supporter of Mrs Mays Chequers plan for Brexit.Ms Rudd told ITVs Peston last night: I don’t think No Deal will happen.I think that  we cant get a negotiated deal that the Prime Minister brings back through Parliament then I think that we’re in completely uncharted territory constitutionally.But I do think it would be ironic indeed  we got a people’s vote because the more Brexit-y people in my party were unable to support the Prime Minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Asked  a second referendum would be better than No Deal, the senior MP replied: Absolutely."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431336217-e1536264401854.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum baby decapitated botched birth doctor said ive fixed him","story":"Laura Gallazzi was 25 weeks pregnant when she went into labour, with a top NHS doctor pulling the babys legs during the birth.But the babys head was detached from his body during the horric delivery, with his head still left in his mothers womb.The first-time mum was then forced to undergo a C-section to remove the head - which was sewn back on to the tragic tots body so she could hold him and say goodbye.Cradling the plush bear that holds her sons ashes, the mum revealed to BBC Radio Scotland her terror at seeing her sons body, unsure what she would be confronted with.She said: I thought I dont want to see him, dont bring him in here, because I didnt know what I was going to be looking at.The doctor said its alright.

But it ruled the senior gynaecologist had been working in the “best interests” of the mum, and that she posed “no risk to patient safety”.The ordeal has taken a huge toll on haunted Laura who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder.The mum now keeps Stevens ashes in a teddy so she can have him with her — and on her forearm has tattoo prints of his hands and feet as well as the roman numerals of the year he was born.She says: “Even though I wasn’t ever able to hold him, I can carry him with me wherever I go now.

But there are options on the table to get out of this mess.“As the numbers show, instead of pumping more cash into failed ideas like Help to Buy, we should be building much more social housing to give hard-pressed families an alternative to the private rented sector.“Not only would this be a massive stride towards ending this crisis, but it’d be wildly popular too – so let’s get on with it.”Between 2001 and 2018 the size of the private rental sector doubled, from 11% of the adult population to 28%.The same period also saw a marked decline in the number who own their own home, falling from 73% of the population to 59%.The Tories are consumed by Brexit. But away from that they must wake up and present radical ideas to beat ­Corbyn’s, especially on housing.They have an advantage.Theirs are more likely to be sane.And vanishingly less likely to put hundreds of thousands on the dole.But Theresa May must realise that voters have more pressing problems than Brexit which could cost her power.Next week the Tories must have a new story to tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or they didn’t want to take food from the children.” MYA’s response was to develop its own service for young people aged 16-25. This week, I took one of those young people – Stacey Bridge – to the Labour conference to speak alongside our other guests, including her childhood hero, the former Everton goalkeeping legend Neville Southall. Over 250 people came to hear them. “The first day I went to the foodbank I thought it would be really horrible,” says Stacey, who now volunteers at MYA and is enrolled in one of its youth programmes. I expected to be really embarrassed and they’d just give you a bag of food. It’s the opposite. You get so much help and support. When I left I actually felt really good.”  Stacey, now 26, had been left homeless after struggling to pay for her dad’s funeral following his murder. “We were down to a bottle of juice and half a loaf of bread when we came in. I was living in a hostel with my partner who was on a low wage working as a chef.” Before that she’d had several nights at a ‘sit up’ service, where there are no beds provided. Stacey now helps at the foodbank where “you see young people come in and their shoes are falling off them”, she says. “You can tell how hungry they are.” I first met Stacey a few weeks ago in Liverpool, and asked her  she’d come to speak at Labour conference – joining Amina Weston, a young woman who was \u0026shyillegally evicted when she was pregnant, and Southall, who now works with excluded kids. I wanted them to remind the conference that every day without a change in government is a lost day for millions of young people. It’s another day hungry. Another day homeless. Another day of a baby brought up in bed and breakfast. Amina, from Leeds, who I met through our Wigan Pier Project, read a poem at our fringe meeting that left some delegates, including Unite leader Len McCluskey, in tears.  “Bedroom floors, sofas, dispersed hostels and bidding numbers,” she read. “What a le for a little baby.” Homelessness meant Amina was forced to give up on her third year of university. Yet she has still gone on to set up a school unorm project with her sister to help struggling families. “It makes you realise what we’re about,” McCluskey said. “We’re about fighting for fairness, for decency, for justice for all people.” Neville Southall spoke about desperately trying to get help for his foster sons and for the excluded kids he now works with. “The education system is a nightmare at the moment,” he said. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell praised our Wigan Pier Project and said that George Orwell had taught in his constituency. The 1984 author had been senior master at the former Hawthorns High School for Boys in the early 1930s, before he left for Wigan.  “If George Orwell came back to my constituency today, he’d find families living in beds in sheds and garages,” McDonnell said in a blistering speech. “We’ve got people living in vans and cars. We’ve reinvented the back-to-back in my constituency – where one family lives in the rear of the property and one in the front. “We’ve got people sleeping in our parks, along the canal and under bridges on a scale we’ve not seen before. Five thousand of our fellow \u0026shycitizens are out there sleeping on the streets tonight. That’s a bloody disgrace in the sixth richest country in the world. “If George Orwell came back today he’d know what zero-hours was like. Because on these docks just down here my dad and my granddad used to line up in the street in the 1930s and they’d be pointed at  they’d got work and  they didn’t they’d be sent home. “That’s what’s happening with zero-hour contracts given to our kids in 2018.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyns economic medicine looks","story":"NewsopinionJeremy Corbyn\u0027s economic medicine looks increasingly attractiveThe Labour leader promised to transform a country still reeling from the financial crash.

This was an address to a country which is still suffering ten years after the financial crash. His plans are bold but his pitch was simple: only Labour has the policies which will mend the damage caused by the banking crisis and the subsequent Tory austerity. Labour, he declared, is now the new majority whose ideas have caught the mood of the time. Much of the speech was directed to those areas which voted Leave in the Brexit referendum.  Corbyn made clear he understood their motives and stood ready to help them rebuild their communities. “There will be no more left behind areas,” he said. Yet this speech was an acknowledgement that his party must do more to persuade voters it was fit to govern. First, there was an appeal to the Labour rank and file to show more unity. Divided and hate-filled parties will not win elections. Secondly, he looked to reassure people that while his agenda was radical it was also common sense. Like a kindly doctor speaking to a patient before an operation, he tried to convince them the procedure may be pioneering but was in their best interests.

The Department for Communities and Local Government received a request under freedom of information laws two years ago asking how regularly James Wharton travelled outside London. The Government flouted a requirement to respond to the request within 20 working days and did not provide a response for more than four months - at which point it denied the application. The Information Commissioner’s Office subsequently launched a probe and found the Government adopted a strategy of “wilful procrastination in order to obstruct a request for information”. The DCLG appealed against the decision to the first-tier tribunal of information rights, where in early 2018 Judge Hazel Oliver ruled that the department must hand over Wharton’s diary.  The whole process took 26 months. The information - diary entries between January and April 2016 - that the Government sought to suppress for two years shows that Mr Wharton rarely left London as part of his ministerial role as the North’s representative. Of the 693 lines of entries in his ministerial diary, half have office details or identiable addresses in the “Location” column, of which 90% of them are in London. Just 28 relate to a meeting or event in the North. Mr Wharton was a Tory MP for Stockton South until he lost his seat in 2017. The Government fought for so long to prevent the release of the information that two other men, Andrew Percy and Jake Berry, have since taken up the role of Northern Powerhouse minister, and the entire department has been renamed as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.  Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a Manchester-based think tank, said: “It is of course disappointing that the minister charged with the Northern Powerhouse spent so little time in the area getting to understand what’s important to the people, communities and businesses of the north. “But the attempts to thwart access to information about the work of the northern Powerhouse minister show a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability. “The Government need to use this as an opportunity to build a much more robust system of transparency and accountability, so that voters in the north can have confidence that the government are really serious and committed to supporting northern leaders to build a better future for the north.” Legal experts also slammed the Government.

Ryan Smith told girlfriend Laura McKay he had made her a good one this year and was excited for the card to be delivered. But when it arrived, a gobsmacked Laura immediately noticed he had made the worst possible mistake - by getting her name wrong. The card, which had a collage of lovely photographs of the couple on the front, read: Make today amazing! Happy birthday Georgia. Laura said: Every year he books a night away somewhere and writes where we’re going in the card but the past two years he’s just told me where he’s booked because the card is always late.  So the weekend before my birthday he’s banging on about this card and how much of a ‘good one’ it is this year. Don’t get me wrong, the pictures he’s picked are my favourite ones of us so I can see why he was excited to give me it. So he hands me it in the same envelope that it got delivered to his house in – even though it comes with two as you’re meant to open it, CHECK IT and put it in a fresh envelope. Might I add when it got delivered to his house, his mum said to him maybe you should check it but he was adamant it was perfect.   Laura posted the amusing gaffe on Twitter - and she sounded a bit upset about it.  She wrote: Right SO Ryan’s just came in with my birthday card  and he’s been concentrating so hard on the f***ing pictures the c**ts forgot to CHANGE the writing. Who the F*** is Georgia? To Laura\u0027s surprise, the tweet was shared thousands of times.  But even though she got a bit sweary, she wasn\u0027t actually upset about the mistake - and even saw the funny side. He does try his best with absolutely everything but sometimes his lack of common sense gets in the way, she said.  This is the most \u0027him\u0027 thing possible.

A road safety campaigner said he should consider himself lucky to have avoided a tragedy after being clocked at 59mph in a 40mph zone.  The case against the former England football captain, 43, was dismissed as the letter informing him of the charge arrived in the post a day too late.  Beckham, represented by celeb lawyer Nick “Mr Loophole” Freeman, said: “I’m very relieved with the verdict and very happy with my legal team.” But Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, suggested the star should have taken his punishment.  He said: “It is hugely disappointing to see a role model like David Beckham shirking his responsibility and getting off a speeding prosecution on a mere technicality. “At the speed Mr Beckham was reported to be travelling, his stopping distance would be double that of someone driving within the limit. “He should count himself very lucky that no \u0026shyincident occurred and tragedy was avoided. “Speeding is a dangerous and selfish act for which there is no excuse. Beckham did not attend the hearing at Wimbledon magistrates court.  But as it took place, the arrogant star posted a picture online with a moan about traffic. The Instagram selfie, showing him in the back of a car looking relaxed in a beanie hat and shades, had the caption: “Angry: London traffic.” He was heading towards the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras to catch a train to Paris, where we Victoria, 44, was attending Paris Fashion Week. Beckham, of Holland Park, West London, was accused of speeding in a borrowed Bentley on the A40 in Paddington on January 23. Mr Freeman told the court he acknowledged the case “may cause some disquiet”. He said Beckham, “accepted he was driving, he’s accepted the speed – that’s not the issue here”.

Scientists discovered a clear link between restricting screen use and improved thinking skills. Canadian researchers looked at 4,520 children aged eight to 11 for the study, which showed that longer breaks from devices help cognitive , while outside activity benefits physical health. So what does too much time with technology actually do to children’s brains, how can you help them cut down, and what should they be doing instead? What can too much screen time do to our children’s brains? Psychologist Dr Susan Marchant-Haycox says brain imaging has shown that frequent users of smartphones tend to have smaller grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex – the brain region that serves cognition and motor control – which can inhibit a person’s ability to pay attention. She adds that obsessive screen time can cause a greater risk of depression, anxiety, insomnia and impulsive behaviour. One study suggests that smartphone obsession can cause greater levels of the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid, GABA. Susan says: “GABA in the brain’s cortex inhibits neurons, compared to levels of the neurotransmitter called glutamate-glutamine, which energises brain signals. “That will create a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can cause anxiety.  What can too much screen time do to our children socially and physically? Spending too much time glued to a screen can make children introverted due to a lack of social interaction, says Dr Marchant-Haycox. This means that youngsters can “become prisoners to their own mobiles or tablets”. Dr Michael Hogan, a lecturer in psychology at the National University of Ireland, says that smartphone use is a modern extension of children watching television after school – except now they’re watching on portable devices. He said of the gadgets: “They’ve got better and better, which means they are certainly more engaging than they used to be – and will continue to no doubt get more sophisticated. There are lots of techniques which are used to draw people back in again and again. “Our social motivations are pretty much universal and have not changed in the last 20 years, but instead the social engagement is being moved to the screens. “It’s quite easy to engage on a device, so this screen time is taking away from face-to-face time. There is the risk of a child becoming more insular.” A study published this year showed that youths who use social media a lot are at greater risk of sleep disturbance that leads to obesity, while there was a 40% decrease in obesity in those whose parents limited their screen time.  Smartphones and creativity Dr Marchant-Haycox argues that excessive use of mobiles and tablets can also inhibit creative thinking – but there can be some advantages to a child’s development, depending on how the devices are used. “Some research suggests that mobile devices could encourage and support imaginative play, rather than just keeping children occupied,” she says. “But a time limit of mobile or tablet usage must be monitored by parents.” Dr Hogan suggests analysing what your child is like in the presence of other youngsters, to see whether they actively engage in physical, real-le scenarios, or stay buried in their gadgets. He says: “If they turn to their phones when they are in a stimulated environment it may mean you need to monitor their time use.” And he says that while some video games may seem more stimulating than other things, it’s about mixing up dferent activities, in the way you might y your child’s diet.

A blast of icy conditions blowing in from the Arctic will push thermometers below zero and could herald snow in Scotland and northern parts of England. Much of the UK is basking in warm summer conditions with temperatures hitting 25C in some parts of the country - but experts say the Indian summer is about to come to an abrupt end. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “It is going to turn colder towards the weekend with a northerly flow of Arctic air bringing temperatures down compared to earlier in the week. “Friday will feel colder and we could see some patchy frosts first thing, daytime temperatures will reach the mid-teens at best and it will feel colder in the north.  “Overnight into Saturday we could see more widespread frosts with temperatures widely dropping, anywhere in the country could see a frost. “It will stay cooler into Sunday and after some morning fog there is the likelihood of sunny spells with daytime temperatures around the mid-teens again.” Gale-force winds will also affect northern parts of the country, she warned. She added: “There will be blustery showers around on Saturday and along northern coasts there will be the risk of gales. “Across the southern half of the country there is more of a chance of seeing some sunshine, the risk of frosts will continue into the start of next week. “There may be some sleet or wet snow over high ground in the north on Sunday night.” Temperatures are forecast to hit -2 in Scotland while Wales and the north of England will see single digit figures. Earlier this week, forecasters suggested Britain could be set for more snow than ever before over the coming months .  The UK could see weeks of snow over the Christmas period as bookmakers say the country could be facing the coldest winter on record. And Coral bookmakers have slashed the odds at 6-4 for this winter to be the coldest on record. Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: We might be enjoying some autumn sunshine now but all the signs are pointing towards a bleak winter with weeks of snow forecast for the Christmas months.

They said the intense cold snap could last all the way to February next year, making it similar to the big freeze of 2010, which saw the coldest December since records began in 1910. Forecaster James Madden said: “Long-range predictions have shown for a time that this winter could deliver some particularly cold and snowy conditions.  “We are expecting a number of widespread snow events to occur during early December and then again around mid-month.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has been accused of posting a series of false and misleading tweets about the trading status of the electric car firm. The allegations relate to messages Musk posted to his 22 million followers on the social media site suggesting he would take Tesla private at 420 per share - a substantial premium to its trading price at the time. Musk claimed funding for the deal had been secured and that the only remaining uncertainty was a shareholder vote.  But the SEC alleges that Musk had not discussed the deal terms with any potential financing partners and a deal was not near. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission say Musk knew or was reckless in not knowing that he was misleading investors.   Musk made his false and misleading public statements about taking Tesla private using his mobile phone in the middle of the active trading day, the SEC said in the complaint. “Corporate officers hold positions of trust in our markets and have important responsibilities to shareholders.  “An officer’s celebrity status or reputation as a technological innovator does not give license to take those responsibilities lightly.”  In a statement issued this evening Musk said: “This unjustied action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed.

The renowned scientist, who discovered gravity, wrote about a second coming of Christ in just over four decades time - marking an end to le as we know it. Born in 1643, Newton was considered an insightful theologian who had a le-long interest in the existence of God and religion. He based a lot of his religious writings on his extensive readings of the Bible.

We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Dundee-bottom.jpg ","title":"dundee are currently the worst football team in the world","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are currently the worst football team in the world, according to statistics.The pressure is mounting on manager Neil McCann after Saturday\u0026#8217s 3-0 home defeat by Hibernian left his side with a record of six defeats in six Premiership games so far this season.And the beleaguered boss will be even more dismayed to discover that, according to one calculation, the Dark Blues are bottom of a world league.Football website whoscored, which takes data from 153 countries, ranks Dundee at the bottom of the international form guide.According to the site, only two other clubs in the world \u0026#8211 Scottish Championship side Falkirk and Bulgarian outfit Septemvri Sofia \u0026#8211 have lost six in a row.But Dundee\u0026#8217s goal dference of -12 puts them at rock bottom.The Dark Blues\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216progress\u0026#8217 in the table has been eagerly followed by Dundee United fans on Twitter.According to @callum1247, the clinching result was last night when Guingamp picked up a point away to Nimes in France\u0026#8217s Ligue 1.Dundee fans have hit back at the inevitable jibes.

We are as much a customer of Europe as we are an exporter. We’ve got to know what the trade terms will look like and just get on with it now.“We also have a very large European workforce who need clarity on  they can stay.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee man steven caulker eyes wigan athletic deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Steven Caulker is hoping to win a deal with Wigan Athletic just weeks after triggering a release clause at Dens.The 26-year-old still had a year left on his contract with the Dark Blues when he left on deadline day.It came just four months after the club had reportedly rejected a seven-figure offer from Rosenborg for the former England international.Caulker was a marquee signing for Neil McCann when he penned an 18-month contract with Dundee in January.Now he is training with Championship side Wigan ahead of a potential deal.Latics boss Paul Cook will run the rule over Caulker before deciding  he’s worth having on board.Aston Villa are also looking for a central defender and have been linked with the big centre-half, who earlier this month was reportedly training with Ukrainian Premier League Arsenal Kiev, managed by Fabrizio Ravanelli.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baa14a3a5de1.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee can get out of this mess theyve done it before","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOn the whole, no points by this stage of the season brings about relegation. Dundee will be hoping they can buck the trend – and they do have some form for it.Try to recall horric starts in the top flight for clubs – St Mirren in 2014, Livingston in 2005, Hamilton 1989, Dumbarton 1984 and Morton 1987 – and they all end in the same horror show of the drop.In 2014, the Buddies had to wait till their sixth game before picking up points, ending in bottom spot with 30 points. Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton boss martin canning wont be shed a tear for under pressure dundee counterpart neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHamilton boss Martin Canning insists he cannot afford to take any notice of Neil McCann’s plight ahead of Saturday’s clash with bottom side Dundee.Pressure is piling on the Dens Park manager after six straight Ladbrokes Premiership defeats and a Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United.However, Canning noted his side beat St Mirren 3-0 at home on Saturday for their first win in four matches, to give Accies some respite of their own.He said: “You’ve got to go and do your own job and my job on Saturday is to try to get Hamilton Accies three points and  we can do that we’ll be delighted.“That’s just football.

Hampden is the home of Scottish football and we all look forward to assisting our SPFL colleagues with the delivery of two very exciting Betfred Cup semi-finals at the Stadium.”Aberdeen made it to the last four by defeating Hibs 6-5 on penalties after a 0-0 draw, while Hearts beat Motherwell 4-2, Rangers thrashed Ayr 4-0 and last year\u0026#8217s winners Celtic beat St Johnstone 1-0 last night.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ball calls on dons to show same character as easter road","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDom Ball says the Dons need to show the same character as they did at Easter Road to beat Celtic and reach the League Cup final.Aberdeen won through to the last four in the cup 6-5 on penalties following a 0-0 draw against Hibs in Edinburgh.The draw for the semi-finals was made last night and the Reds will face Rangers with the game set to be played the weekend of October 27 and 28.Before that Derek McInnes’ team travel to Parkhead on Saturday to take on champions Celtic.In the capital on Tuesday Aberdeen showed plenty of character and resilience to hang in against a strong Hibs side.And when the tie went to penalties they held their nerve to go through. Ball wants the Dons to show the same character this weekend as they look to beat the Hoops and in the semi-final.The 23-year-old said: “It was amazing, coming away from home playing 90 minutes and extra-time and then going to penalties.“To win like that makes it that little bit sweeter and all the lads are buzzing.“We definitely showed character and that is what we’re about – we find a way to win.“We are trying to build a bit of momentum now and we’ve got to take that  into Saturday now and take confidence from it.“We don’t know what’s going to happen in this tournament.“But on Tuesday we showed a lot of character and a lot of bottle and hopefully we can take that into the semi-final.”On the semi-final draw Ball added: “I had no preference with the draw, we’ll be ready for it when it comes around.”Something else that gives the Reds confidence ahead of the trip to Glasgow on Saturday was winning at Parkhead on their last visit.Having not won a league fixture at the ground in 14 years, the Dons triumphed 1-0 on the final day of last term to secure second spot for the fourth season running.Ball played that day and the defensive midfielder says knowing they’ve done it before gives them belief for the latest clash.He also says there won’t be a hangover from playing 120 minutes against Hibs earlier this week.The Englishman said: “We take confidence for Saturday from the last time we played Celtic as well.“We went there at the end of last season under so much pressure and managed to get the win we needed.“With the momentum we have built this season in the last couple of games we’ll carry that on into Saturday.“We’ve had two very tough games over the last week. We went to extra-time on Tuesday, but we’ll recover from that and prepare correctly.“So I don’t think that should make a dference – we’ll be fine.“I think we’ve done well through the season, but we’ve been a bit unlucky with results.“The last two games  have been good and we want to carry that on.”The closest Aberdeen came to breaking the deadlock on Tuesday was Ball’s first-half free-kick which struck the crossbar.The Rotherham loanee has yet to score for the Dons, but he revealed he would be keen to take free-kicks more often.He said: “I was getting ready to celebrate but it didn’t go in.“Hopefully I’ll get a goal soon, but the main thing was that we got the win.“I used to take free-kicks and I thought at the time with Niall McGinn not being on the pitch it was right for me to take it then. But it didn’t go in. I always fancy myself in that position to take a free-kick.“So  I get another chance in that position I’ll stand up to take it.”Tuesday also saw James Wilson make his second start for the Reds.Although the Manchester United loanee didn’t score, he showed plenty of impressive touches.Ball said: “I think Willo has come in in the last two games and he has made a massive dference.“He got his goal on Saturday against Motherwell and on the ball he looks really good.“The hard work he has shown as well has given the team a boost.“Having that focal point makes a dference.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a sweet way to raise zambian money","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/09/18, 10:17 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe coffers of a Mid Argyll charity were boosted by the aroma of fresh coffee and lemon drizzle cake.People were drawn to Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall on Saturday September 15 for a fundraising coffee morning with plenty of home baking.The two-hour event raised £335, which will help ZamScotEd  with its work in Zambia, where it is completing a secondary school in the Lusaka area.The charity\u0026#8217s founder, Marian Pallister, said: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who helped us achieve this fantastic sum of money.\u0026#8217PICS:Four-year-old Lily with baby Natalie and mum Annie Galloway from Lochgilphead enjoying a cuppa and a cake. 06_a38ZamScotEd01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mojo 4 below","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 19/09/18, 6:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOctober is almost here, and that means so is MOJO 2018But  all you music makers, shakers and fans cannot wait until the big night, check out the MOJO Facebook page for demos, more information on each of the acts and their inidual social media accounts.4 Below is the new alternative rock creation of Oban musician, Andy Bruce.Taking up music in his teens, Andy initially learnt bass playing within a musical group of friends gaining lots of experience with bass.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

They heard there is a stigma associated with talking about loneliness and isolation but people of all ages are at risk of being lonely. It often occurs at times of change in people’s lives such as leaving home, starting a family, retirement or bereavement.A recent survey over the whole of NHS Highland, including Mid Argyll, found that 67 per cent of older people sometimes feel lonely and for eight per cent of respondents this increased to often feeling extremely lonely.Cumlodden Guild signed up to NHS Highland’s campaign called Reach Out – make a dference to someone who’s lonely, making a pledge to raise awareness in the church congregation and to talk about loneliness and isolation in their local communities.Alison McGrory said: \u0026#8216My job is about preventing health problems before they arise and enabling people to lead as healthy a le as possible. Loneliness is a bigger public health risk than physical activity or weight management and causes as many premature deaths as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This is a compelling reason to take action.\u0026#8216NHS Highland’s Reach Out campaign has been developed to encourage more people to think about the part they can play in reducing loneliness. It costs nothing to reach out a hand of kindness and say hello to someone in the street or knock on a neighbour’s door to check they are OK.\u0026#8216You can sign up to the Reach Out campaign on facebook at NHS Highland Reach Out.\u0026#8217Sue Campbell of Cumlodden Church Guild said: \u0026#8216Cumlodden Church Guild is delighted to sign up to the Reach Out campaign.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

Three-year-old Bobby was even decked out in a matching KILT during the unique ceremony at Ayr’s Savoy Park.

Lisa revealed: “We must have visited more than 30 but were blown away by the approach of the Savoy Park. “Lots of places didn’t like the idea of a dog running around during the wedding, but the Savoy couldn’t have been more accomodating. “The three of us are going on a doggy-moon and will spend time glamping. But me and Robert are also heading to Australia so hopefully he’ll be okay without us.” Savoy general manager Barbara Christie said: “We were delighted to have Bobby as part of the day and he was a real star. “He came to get ready beforehand – complete with his doggy aftershave. “A couple of years ago this might have seemed odd but it’s something that more people are now wanting. “Dogs are a big part of the family so I’m sure it’s not the last time we’ll host a ceremony like this.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrTartanPetsAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents.

allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh produced hours of fiery, emotional testimony.\nBoth Mr Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing him of sexual assault when they were high school students, appeared before senators on Thursday. Mr Kavanaugh denied the accusation.\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the extraordinary hearing:\nChristine Blasey Ford becomes emotional during the hearing \nWhat did Ms Ford say?\nMs Ford gave a soft-spoken and steady account about what she said happened three decades ago in a bedroom at a small gathering of friends. She said she came forward not for political reasons, but because it was her \u0026ldquocivic duty.\nShe described in detail how an inebriated Mr Kavanaugh and another teenager, Mark Judge, locked her in a room at a house party as Mr Kavanaugh was grinding and groping her.\nShe said he put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams, and testied: \u0026ldquoI believed he was going to rape me.\nThe 51-year-old mother of two said the incident was seared into her mind through trauma, while admitting there were some gaps in her memory around the attack.\nMs Ford, a Calornia psychology professor making her first public remarks about the incident, choked up occasionally as she described the alleged attack.\nDemocratic senators questioned her directly, but the 11 Republican members on the committee instead chose to have a female sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona question her.\nAsked how certain she was that Mr Kavanaugh was her attacker, she declared: \u0026ldquo100%.\nBrett Kavanaugh testies before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nWhat did Mr Kavanaugh say?\nMr Kavanaugh ditched his prepared remarks and instead issued a blistering statement declaring the confirmation process \u0026ldquoa national disgrace.\nHe strongly denied Ms Ford\u0026rsquos allegation, but said he believed she had been the victim of a sexual assault. The father of two daughters said one of his girls said they should \u0026ldquopray for the woman accusing him.\n\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old, he said, choking up.\nMr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos scorched-earth strategy gave president Donald Trump what he wanted: a nominee willing to fight back aggressively and yield no ground to Democrats.\nEchoing Ms Ford, he said he was \u0026ldquo100% certain he did not commit the assault.\nAt times, Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos frustrations boiled over. When Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked  he had ever drunk so much he blacked out, he snapped: \u0026ldquoHave you?.\nHe later apologised.\nMoments after the hearing finished, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Kavanaugh \u0026ldquoshowed America exactly why I nominated him.\nPhoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell questions Christine Blasey Ford \nWhat happened to the prosecutor?\nRepublicans appointed prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Ms Ford, and she led off the questioning of Mr Kavanaugh. Then she quickly faded away.\nAfter Ms Mitchell asked Mr Kavanaugh several detailed questions about Ms Ford\u0026rsquos allegations, the GOP senators took matters into their own hands.\nSenator Lindsey Graham led the way with a scorching denunciation of Democrats for raising the allegations against Mr Kavanaugh in the final days of the confirmation process.\nFrom there, each GOP senator handled his own questions, while Ms Mitchell sat silently nearby.\nHours earlier, Ms Mitchell opened her questioning of Ms Ford by expressing sympathy for the professor, who said she was \u0026ldquoterried to testy.\n\u0026ldquoI just wanted to let you know, I\u0026rsquom very sorry. That\u0026rsquos not right, Ms Mitchell said.\nSenator Orrin Hatch speaks to the media after the hearing \nWhat happens next?\nRepublicans quickly expressed their determination to move forward. After huddling in the Capitol, senators said the Judiciary Committee would hold a Friday morning vote on whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh for confirmation.\nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a long-time committee member, said he thinks Mr Kavanaugh will get confirmed by a party-line vote.\nRepublicans\u0026rsquo margin for error in the full Senate is slim. If all Democrats oppose the nomination, just two GOP senators would sink Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos confirmation  they were to oppose him as well.\nMultiple Republican politicians have not said which way they will vote, including two women with reputations as moderates who have been willing to buck their party \u0026ndash Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\nMr Graham cautioned them against voting no.\n\u0026ldquoTo my Republican colleagues,  you vote no, you\u0026rsquore legitimising the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics, he said.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new

of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son

fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from

ago, in 1918, when racquets were made of wood, strung with animal gut and required presses to stop them warping, the captain and officers, of Australian depot ship HMS Platypus, presented a cup to Campbeltown Lawn Tennis club.The following year the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.

Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.

It hopes to transform the building, which has lain empty for six years, into a workspace offering \u0026ldquoinspiration and support to freelancers, commuters, remote workers, artists, businesses, social enterprises and community groups in and around the town.  The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable. This grant will let us engage an architect to assess the building and estimate the costs.  Sustaining Dunbar, formed in 2008, is a community development trust and charity. It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year. And profits from the operation will be invested in practical support for local community groups and social enterprises.  Jo McNamara, chairwoman of Sustaining Dunbar, felt the funding boost was \u0026ldquoa signicant step towards our vision of developing something really special in Dunbar.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhile creating more workspace is essential for the area, what\u0026rsquos truly exciting is the way co-working spaces like this can bring people together \u0026ndash to share ideas, to collaborate and to build a stronger community.

Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.  In August,Yard of Ale played a fundraiser for Musselburgh Athletic Football Club to help them achieve their transition to senior football.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.

University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.

Mr Kavanaugh denied the accusation.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the extraordinary hearing:  What did Ms Ford say?  Ms Ford gave a soft-spoken and steady account about what she said happened three decades ago in a bedroom at a small gathering of friends. She said she came forward not for political reasons, but because it was her \u0026ldquocivic duty.  She described in detail how an inebriated Mr Kavanaugh and another teenager, Mark Judge, locked her in a room at a house party as Mr Kavanaugh was grinding and groping her.  She said he put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams, and testied: \u0026ldquoI believed he was going to rape me.  The 51-year-old mother of two said the incident was seared into her mind through trauma, while admitting there were some gaps in her memory around the attack.  Ms Ford, a Calornia psychology professor making her first public remarks about the incident, choked up occasionally as she described the alleged attack.  Democratic senators questioned her directly, but the 11 Republican members on the committee instead chose to have a female sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona question her.  Asked how certain she was that Mr Kavanaugh was her attacker, she declared: \u0026ldquo100%.  What did Mr Kavanaugh say?  Mr Kavanaugh ditched his prepared remarks and instead issued a blistering statement declaring the confirmation process \u0026ldquoa national disgrace.  He strongly denied Ms Ford\u0026rsquos allegation, but said he believed she had been the victim of a sexual assault. The father of two daughters said one of his girls said they should \u0026ldquopray for the woman accusing him.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old, he said, choking up.  Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos scorched-earth strategy gave president Donald Trump what he wanted: a nominee willing to fight back aggressively and yield no ground to Democrats.  Echoing Ms Ford, he said he was \u0026ldquo100% certain he did not commit the assault.  At times, Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos frustrations boiled over. When Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked  he had ever drunk so much he blacked out, he snapped: \u0026ldquoHave you?.  He later apologised.  Moments after the hearing finished, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Kavanaugh \u0026ldquoshowed America exactly why I nominated him.  What happened to the prosecutor?  Republicans appointed prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Ms Ford, and she led off the questioning of Mr Kavanaugh. Then she quickly faded away.  After Ms Mitchell asked Mr Kavanaugh several detailed questions about Ms Ford\u0026rsquos allegations, the GOP senators took matters into their own hands.  Senator Lindsey Graham led the way with a scorching denunciation of Democrats for raising the allegations against Mr Kavanaugh in the final days of the confirmation process.  From there, each GOP senator handled his own questions, while Ms Mitchell sat silently nearby.  Hours earlier, Ms Mitchell opened her questioning of Ms Ford by expressing sympathy for the professor, who said she was \u0026ldquoterried to testy.  \u0026ldquoI just wanted to let you know, I\u0026rsquom very sorry. That\u0026rsquos not right, Ms Mitchell said.  What happens next?  Republicans quickly expressed their determination to move forward. After huddling in the Capitol, senators said the Judiciary Committee would hold a Friday morning vote on whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh for confirmation.  Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a long-time committee member, said he thinks Mr Kavanaugh will get confirmed by a party-line vote.  Republicans\u0026rsquo margin for error in the full Senate is slim. If all Democrats oppose the nomination, just two GOP senators would sink Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos confirmation  they were to oppose him as well.  Multiple Republican politicians have not said which way they will vote, including two women with reputations as moderates who have been willing to buck their party \u0026ndash Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.  Mr Graham cautioned them against voting no.  \u0026ldquoTo my Republican colleagues,  you vote no, you\u0026rsquore legitimising the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics, he said."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7628546.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"independent-review-of-football-policing-strategy-ordered","story":"  Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said Police Scotland has an \"enviable reputation\" for how it polices large events, but that any \"mature organisation\" has to be able to challenge itself about how it could do better.  :\u0026nbspCeltic fans describe scenes of \u0026lsquototal chaos\u0026rsquo in Parkhead \u0026lsquocrushing\u0026rsquo fears ahead of Old Firm  He told the Scottish Police Authority board meeting in Stirling that the appointment of the expert will be finalised in the next couple of weeks, and the review should be completed by Christmas.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

And he will say that Labour is ready to deliver \u0026ldquothe radical plan we need to rebuild and transform Britain, telling delegates: \u0026ldquoThe old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  Mr Corbyn will say Britain needs a government \u0026ldquocommitted to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training, and will promise large-scale public and private investment in wind and solar power, as well as subsidies to make all homes energy-efficient.  The insulation programme alone would create 160,000 jobs alone spread across the UK.  Changes to planning guidance will aim to encourage private investment to double onshore wind power over 12 years, while offshore wind will be increased sevenfold and solar power threefold.  \u0026ldquoScotland would clearly benefit extensively from this level of investment in terms of jobs and living standards, and it is something that would be very welcome in Scotland, stressed the Labour leader\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos speech comes at the end of a four-day conference which has been dominated by Brexit but has seen the Labour leader and shadow chancellor John McDonnell set out a range of policies to reverse inequalities in wealth and economic power.  These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: \"Those are the words of the motion that was supported by the National Executive and the Shadow Cabinet and that is what is being voted on in conference\u0026hellip  \"Keir put that in because it\u0027s what\u0027s there in the motion. We will challenge this Government. If they don\u0027t meet our six tests, we will vote against it, and then we will take it from there, he declared.  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over the nature of a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell insisted Remain would not be part of the question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote conference speech yesterday he again claimed not only had Remain to be an option in any future referendum but no-one, including the Shadow Chancellor, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  After the Brexit debate, delegates approved by a show of hands the proposed motion, which, in the event of the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plan failing to get MPs\u0026rsquo support, called for a general election with the option of a second referendum  one did not happen.  The vast majority were in favour of the motion with only a small number against."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-universities-slip-down-global-rankings","story":"  Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews all lost ground in the latest Times Higher Education rankings of the top 200 universities in the world - while Dundee dropped out altogether.  The only university to buck the downward trend was Aberdeen, which jumped from 185th to 158th.  Scotland now has only four universities in the global top 200, compared to five last year, with Edinburgh in 29th place, Glasgow in 93rd, Aberdeen 158th and St Andrews 165th.  Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, which represents principals, warned investment was falling behind international competitors.  The sector has raised concerns in recent years that public funding does not support the full cost of running courses - leaving universities having to raise money by recruiting international students or those from the rest of the UK who pay fees.  Times Higher Education also raised concerns over the impact of Brexit with uncertainties over recruitment of the students and academics from across the EU.  Mr Sim said: \"Despite our commitment to excellence, we\u0026rsquove seen an overall fall in rankings for Scottish institutions. This reflects the ferocity of international competition from nations that are investing in higher education to drive economic growth.  \"A clear pattern is emerging between the level of resource available to higher education sectors by country and the trajectory of that country within global league tables.  \"This year, we\u0026rsquove seen Japan overtake the UK as the second most-represented nation in the rankings for the first time. We\u0026rsquove also seen Scotland\u0026rsquos number of universities in the top 200 drop from five to four.\"  Mr Sim called for sustainable investment to preserve Scotland\u0026rsquos \"critical advantage\" as a place to study, research and do business.  Richard Lochhead, the Higher Education Minister, praised Scotland\u0027s overall performance, but also highlighted uncertainties over Brexit.  He said: \"By head of population, Scotland has more universities in the top 200 than any other country except Switzerland underlining the strength and breadth of our higher education institutions.  \u0026ldquoIt is however worrying that Times Higher Education highlights that, in the face of growing global competition, Brexit poses a risk to the performance of our universities and suggests the UK will struggle to attract the best international talent and build productive research partnerships due to isolationism.\"  Aberdeen University welcomed the new rankings highlighting its strong recent performance in research.  Marion Campbell, vice-principal for research said: \u0026ldquoAt our core we are a research-led institution placing world class research, teaching and innovation at the centre of all our activities.  \u0026ldquoOur progress into the world\u0026rsquos top 160 reflects the excellent global impact in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.\"  Glasgow University said it was pleased to remain in the top 200 despite a decline from 80th to 93rd.  A spokeswoman said: \"The university remains committed to excellence in teaching and research, and to strengthening the international reputation we have established in the higher education sector.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said, \u0026ldquoWhile we are disappointed to have dropped out of the world\u0026rsquos top 200, it should be noted that our position among UK universities remains largely unchanged. This suggests that increased international competition is the main driver of these changes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-adviser-firm-told-no-more-cash-on-97m-ferry-deal","story":"  The government-owned body which ordered the vessels flatly rejected claims by tycoon Jim McColl that it was to blame for design changes and therefore liable for extra costs.  Kevin Hobbs, chief executive of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , told MSPs that responsibility for the extra costs lay squarely with Mr McColl\u0026rsquos shipbuilding firm.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more\u0026hellip that is not our problem, he said.  Mr Hobbs also appeared to take a swipe at Mr McColl, saying pointedly that CMAL had been \u0026ldquoextremely honourable and hadn\u0026rsquot \u0026ldquomoaned and groaned about the contract in the press.  Mr McColl gave an interview to this week\u0026rsquos Sunday Times in which he said he was on the verge of taking CMAL to court over design-related delays.  The ships are being built by Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, which Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire bought out of administration in 2014.  The vessels should have been delivered this year, increasing capacity on the Ardrossan to Arran route and Uig triangle, but have been delayed to next summer and spring 2020.  Since the delays first emerged in July 2017, the Scottish Government has loaned Ferguson\u0027s \u0026pound45m of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to ensure the yard\u0026rsquos continued \u0026ldquoviability.  Amid growing concern at Holyrood over the arrangement, Mr McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, put blame on CMAL.  He told the Sunday Times: \"The construction process is slower because the ferries are prototypes. Because of this there have been additional costs which we have funded and which CMAL have refused to discuss. This is what has necessitated the loans from the Scottish government. CMAL\u0027s attitude has put our business under pressure.\"  He added: \"I\u0027m very frustrated with CMAL. They should have carried out more design and development work on this project before they put it out to tender.\"  However Mr Hobbs was emphatic that Ferguson\u0027s had bid for and signed a \u0026ldquofixed price design and build contract, and CMAL did not intend to pay any more.  He said: \u0026ldquoFerguson Marine along with everybody else bidding for that contract at the time, they\u0026rsquore private companies, and with a private company there\u0026rsquos risk and reward.  \u0026ldquoThey signed up to that contract knowingly and willingly, and as far as we\u0026rsquore concerned \u0026pound97m is what we have to pay.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more. Our assertion at this particular point in time is that is not our problem.  \u0026ldquoThat is the problem of a private company that knowingly and willingly bid for these vessels.\"  He added: \u0026ldquoWe feel we\u0026rsquove been extremely honourable. We haven\u0026rsquot gone to the press. We haven\u0026rsquot moaned and groaned.  Mr Hobbs suggested CMAL might not even pay the \u0026pound97m, as the contract allowed for \u0026ldquoliquidated damages, or compensation, for missed delivery dates and quality issues.  There are a number of things at the end of the contract which we will have to weigh up.  Mr Hobbs also said that although the two \u0026ldquodual-fuel vessels were the first of their kind built in the UK, they were not new technology, with 2000 such engines bought worldwide.  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos complaint was also challenged by CMAL director of vessels Jim Anderson.  He said Ferguson\u0027s had tabled the \u0026ldquooutstanding bid for the dual-fuel ferries on quality and cost grounds, demonstrating the firm \u0026ldquocompletely understood what was expected.  Labour MSP Colin Smyth asked  CMAL was to blame for signicant design changes.  Mr Anderson replied: \u0026ldquoThere have been no signicant changes in design. That\u0026rsquos quite clear. So what you\u0026rsquore reading is untrue.  Pressed on the cause of the delays and cost overruns, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos one you would really have to ask Ferguson\u0026rsquos. We have a clear contract.  \u0026ldquoIf any project which had a timescale of 31 months and 33 months is now being extended to 44 months and 52 months, of course there\u0026rsquos going to be cost overruns. It\u0026rsquos quite clear that  a project takes almost twice as it was envisaged, there will be cost overruns.\"  Asked  any cost overruns were related to design, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoNone whatsoever.  CalMac managing director Robbie Drummond told MSPs it would have made a \"signicant dference\" to services  the new ships had been delivered on time.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re as disappointed as our communities are that that has been delayed.\"  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP knew about problems and cost overruns on the yet to be delivered two new CalMac ferries over 15 months ago but chose to say nothing to Parliament, instead a secret backdoor loan was given to the manufacturer.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos nothing short of a complete farce.  Ferguson Marine was\u0026nbspasked for its reaction to Mr Hobbs and Mr Anderson\u0027s comments."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-jeremy-corbyn-rallies-the-socialist-faithful-saying-were-ready-to-take-charge","story":"  Hairs were standing up across thousands of Socialist necks as showtime with Jezza finally arrived.  After the Liverpool People\u0026rsquos Choir set the mood with the comradely anthem of \u0026ldquoHe ain\u0026rsquot heavy, he\u0026rsquos my brother, the roof almost came off the Liverpool auditorium as delegates shouted, whooped and cheered to greet the shimmering arrival of the Reverend Jeremy.  Needless to say, another anthem struck up immediately as JC slowly breathed in wave after wave of Labour adulation: \u0026ldquoOooooh Jeremy Corbyn! Oooooh Jeremy Corbyn!  One happy-clappy comrade a few seats down was clad in Labour red, including a red bowler hat. He was dancing around as  Labour had already won the election.  Of course, the party leader had to begin his Socialist sermon by thanking the workers \u0026ndash who else? - who had made the conference possible.  And to settle the troops down, there was a joke at Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos expense naturally.  Insisting, unlike the Tories who got their money from dodgy donors and shoddy business clubs, Labour\u0026rsquos funds came from ordinary honest types, Jezza insisted: \u0026ldquoSo I don\u0026rsquot have to play tennis with an oligarch. Labour trades in hope for the many, not favours for the few.  Another target was, of course, the Tory propagandists of HM Press.  The Reverend Jeremy insisted the freedom of the press had to be protected and pointed to noble Turkish and Colombian journalists who had been imprisoned for holding authoritarian governments to account.  But, of course, British journalists were dferent. Hiss. The free press here too often meant the freedom to spread lies and to \u0026ldquosmear the powerless, not take on the powerful. Hiss.  He denounced the Press\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopropaganda of privilege and said it could be challenged by ordinary folk taking to social media.  Jezza insisted Labour was \u0026ldquoready to take charge and appealed to the comrades to show solidarity and unity. When Labour was ided, he told the congregation, the only winners were the rich and their champion: the Tories.  There was an attempt to molly those in the Jewish community outraged by anti-Semitism within the party as the leader, his voice reducing to almost a whisper, recognised their \u0026ldquoimmense hurt and anxiety, and insisted the Labour movement would be \u0026ldquoimplacable campaigners against all racism.  And the Socialist hero went on the attack, lambasting the Tories for backing the right-wing authoritarian government of Hungary\u0026rsquos Viktor Orban, and of creating the \u0026ldquohostile environment that created the Windrush scandal.  This, declared Jezza, was a \u0026ldquonasty, cynical politics, that demeans our whole country. And there was another bf to Bozza\u0026rsquos chin as he decried the former Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquodog-whistle jibe at Muslim women over the letter-box burka row.  But arguably the loudest rise in volume came when Jezza announced that a Labour government in its first year would recognise the state of Palestine. Delegates rose to their feet and several Palestinian flags were waved as the conference whooped and clapped their approval.  Of course, the subject that hangs over all of us made a late appearance.  Reverend Jeremy denounced Theresa May for wanting to create a post Brexit dystopia where the rich flourished in a low tax haven and workers saw their rights destroyed.  Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, was itching to privatise the NHS \u0026ldquowith a side order of chlorinated chicken.  Then the chief comrade raised another Tory bogeyman: Jacob Rees-Mogg. Boos echoed around the conference hall. The ardent Brexiteer, quipped Jezza, had expressed his personal faith in Brexit Britain by, er, deciding to base his new investment fund in the eurozone.  Touching oh-so-briefly on the Labour split on the People\u0026rsquos Vote, the hairy Leftie noted how Keir Starmer had negotiated an agreement on the subject between the party\u0026rsquos factions, saying how \u0026ldquogetting one in Brussels should be a piece of cake.  The final flourish had a central message: \u0026ldquowe\u0026rsquore ready to take charge. Labour, insisted Jezza, was offering a radical plan to transform and rebuild Britain into the New Jerusalem. \u0026ldquoTogether we can.  And that was it. As the screen behind Jezza showed people creating the message \u0026ldquoRebuilding Britain, there was an earthquake of cheering and clapping. The Socialist Messiah grinned broadly. More \u0026ldquoOoooh Jeremy Corbyn! chants.

The Scottish made thriller Calibre leads this year\u0026rsquos nominations, with five.

Gillan\u0026rsquos film was produced by Claire Mundell, of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Synchronicity Films.

Palmer is also in the best writer category, as is Iannucci and David Kane, for Shetland.  : Iannucci given special award by BAFTA Scotland  BAFTA Scotland said that only 18% of entrants to the writer category were women, 21% of entrants to the director of fiction category, and 31% for the director of factual category.

Ms MacLaverty noted the lack of women in key categories, and said: \u0026ldquoIt is something that BAFTA, at ground level are always trying to push and try and do something about.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of the industry at the moment, and the jury can only work with what they have - but BAFTA at every level, from panellists to juries, which were 54% female, are aware of this.  The award ceremony for this year\u0026rsquos British Academy of Film and Television Arts in Scotland is on November 4 in Glasgow.  Ms MacLaverty added: \u0026ldquoI might even say it on the night of the ceremony: people just need to employ women, they need to give them the jobs.  \u0026ldquoI love the actress who said: \u0026lsquoTo casting people, could this part be a woman?\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoFrom what I hear, Scotland has never been busier, and crews are being really stretched, and so we are doing a lot of work to fill some training gaps, and I see a lot more women taking part.  Edith Bowman, who is host of the awards, noted: \u0026ldquoIt is not a criticism of Bafta - it is the production companies: women need to be given the opportunity when the production is being put together for cast and crew.

And after a decade of austerity, the next Labour government will confront the challenge of rebuilding our public services.\"  At the end of a conference dominated by Brexit, Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour would vote against Theresa May\u0027s Chequers plan and keep the option of a second referendum on EU withdrawal \"on the table\".  But he left no doubt that a general election is his preferred outcome, sending a message to the Prime Minister: \"Brexit is about the future of our country and our vital interests. It is not about leadership squabbles or parliamentary posturing.  \"If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland,  you protect jobs, people\u0027s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.  \"But  you can\u0027t negotiate that deal, then you need to make way for a party that can.\"  Mr Corbyn sought to draw a line under the anti-Semitism scandals which have dogged Labour over the summer, promising to \"eradicate anti-Semitism, both from our party and wider society\" and telling the Jewish community: \"We are your ally.\"  But he made clear that he would not back away from criticism of Israel, condemning illegal settlements and the detention of Palestinian children as an \"outrage\".  And he announced - to sustained applause and the waving of Palestinian flags - that a Labour government would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it took office.  He issued an appeal for unity to the feuding wings of his party and called for an end to abuse on social media.  In a riposte to critics who accuse him of narrowing Labour to a Leftist cult, he insisted the party must remain a \"broad church\" and declared: \"Our movement has achieved nothing when ided...We are on a journey together and can only complete it together.\"  Mr Corbyn denounced the \"greed-is-good capitalism\" which led to the financial crash of 2008 and the political and economic establishment which \"strained every sinew\" to shore up the system which created it.  \"We can no longer tolerate a set-up where the real economy, in which millions work, is just a sort of sideshow for the City of London and for banks fixated on piling up profits around the world,\" said the Labour leader.  \"Inequality is not just a matter of incomes. It\u0027s about having a real say too.  \"That\u0027s why we are not only determined to rebuild our economy, communities and public services, but also to democratise them, and change the way our economic system is run in the interests of the majority.\"  He spelt out plans for all private companies with 250 or more staff to reserve one-third of seats on their boards for workers and to transfer 10 per cent of their equity into shareholding funds delivering employees up to \u0026pound500 a year and granting them a voice in corporate decisions.  But he assured businesses Labour would also deliver \"what you need to succeed and to expand and modernise our economy - more investment in our transport, housing and digital infrastructure, more investment in education and skills, so workers are more productive\".  Warning of the rise of far-right politics around the world since the crash, Mr Corbyn said: \"People in this country know that the old way of running things isn\u0027t working any more. And unless we offer radical solutions, others will fill the gap with the politics of blame and ision.\"  He declared that Labour was winning the public debate and now represented \"the new political mainstream\" with \"an alternative to the politics of austerity, of social ision and of international conflict\".  And he won a standing ovation as he promised: \"Where the Tories have ided and ruled, we will unite and govern. We represent the new common sense of our time. And we are ready to deliver on it.  \"United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997. So that when we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government.\"  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, claimed Mr Corbyn had shown at every turn how he was unfit to govern.  \u0026ldquoAll he offers are failed ideas that didn\u0026rsquot work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste just like last time.  Mr Lewis said the Labour leader had confirmed the Opposition was \u0026ldquoopening the door to re-running the referendum, which, he added, \u0026ldquowould take us all back to square one.  Ian Blackford for the SNP claimed Labour offered Scotland nothing but \u0026ldquoeconomic chaos and incompetence.  The Highland MP said while Mr Corbyn might have been forced into saying he would not accept a no-deal Brexit, he remained committed, like the Tories, to taking Scotland out of the EU against its will and imposed a \u0026ldquoreckless plan to drag Scotland off a hard Brexit clf-edge.  He added: \u0026ldquoAfter a bitterly ided conference, dominated by rows over Brexit, racism, and sectarianism, Labour have shown they aren\u0026rsquot even fit for opposition let alone government.  Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said: \u0026ldquoOnly Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership could fudge Brexit this much. By refusing to unequivocally back campaigning for a final say on Brexit, Labour is committed to nothing.  The East Dunbartonshire MP added: \u0026ldquoThe public know where Corbyn\u0026rsquos heart lies on Brexit and they don\u0026rsquot trust him. He didn\u0026rsquot deliver in the referendum campaign, and he hasn\u0026rsquot offered any solutions since. He is still dancing at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit disco."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-raises-prospect-of-brexit-related-food-rationing","story":"  The First Minister raised the prospect in response to new the UK government had appointed the first minister for food supplies since World War II.  It emerged on Wednesday that Tory MP David Rutley, a former executive at Asda and PepsiCo, had been given the brief at the Department of Agriculture earlier this month.  The UK government\u0026rsquos own analysis has suggested there could be shortages of food supplies after a No Deal Brexit because of logjams at ports and knock on effects on road haulage.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Ms Sturgeon was asked by SNP MSP Rona Mackay  the possibility of rationing should mean a stop to \u0026ldquothis Brexit madness.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoThis news would have made most people across the UK stop in their tracks. The Tories\u0026rsquo stewardship of Brexit and the UK as a whole is proving so catastrophic that they have had to appoint a minister for food supplies, which is the first time that such a post has been held since world war two.  \u0026ldquoHow has it come to this situation? It is shameful, and it should be a source of shame for a long time to come for every member of the Conservative Party.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that it will not come to food rationing in this country.  \u0026ldquoIf there ever comes a day when there is food rationing in this country because of a Tory Brexit, perhaps the first people who should bear the burden of that are Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis and Michael Gove - all people who perpetrated a dishonesty on the people of this country.

The government gave the loan to Ferguson Marine, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, in September 2017 after it experienced cash flow problems.  At the time, it was falling behind on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two new CalMac ferries.  However Finance Secretary Derek Mackay did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee about the loan until April, a few weeks before he publicly announced another \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos.  He later confirmed the money was needed to ensure the firm\u0027s \"viability\".  Ferguson Marine is part of the Clyde Blowers empire created by Monaco-based tycoon Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0027s Council of Economic Advisers.  The two loans are given a \"very brief\" paragraph in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consolidated accounts for 2017-18, which were published on Thursday.  They are described as a \u0026ldquostrategic investment in Scotland\u0026rsquos industrial capability.  In its accompanying report, Audit Scotland gave the accounts a clean bill of health.  The watchdog said the government underspend was \u0026pound339m on a \u0026pound34.5bn budget, made up of \u0026pound287m resource and \u0026pound52m capital, up from a total underspend of \u0026pound85m in 2016-17.  The main underspends were in Education and Skills  and Rural Economy .  Auditor General Caroline Gardner said improvements were needed to aid transparency, specically a new framework about financial interventions in private companies.  She said there was \u0026ldquolimited public information about the financial support to Ferguson\u0026rsquos Marine and a \u0026pound25m of loans to Fe-based manufacturer Bi-Fab.  Her report said: \"The provision of loan facilities to private sector companies highlights the Scottish Government\u0027s increasing risk appetite in providing financial support and guarantees to support policy objectives.  \u0026ldquoThere is a need for the Scottish Government to be more transparent about its overall approach in providing signicant public funds to support private companies.  \u0026ldquoWhile the business cases for loan support were clear, there is no framework in place to support the Government\u0027s decision making or approach in providing loans to private companies.  It added that by August this year, \u0026pound26m of the \u0026pound45m Ferguson loan had been drawn down.  She said: \"The Scottish Government has taken some important steps to improving its financial reporting, but there are a number of areas it can improve on to help support the Parliament and public in their scrutiny of public finances.  \"It needs to be more transparent about its overall approach to providing loans to private companies and develop a clear framework to guide its decision-making around how it invests public money.\"  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \"It is completely unacceptable that the initial loan from the SNP government to Ferguson Marine only came to light as a result of Freedom of Information legislation.  \"Audit Scotland has correctly identied that the SNP government is routinely conducting its financial affairs under a shroud of secrecy.  \"The SNP government must listen to the criticisms of Audit Scotland and provide detailed information to the Scottish Parliament regarding the increasing financial risks they are taking with taxpayers\u0027 money.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \"The Auditor General is right to warn of the dangers of loans being given to private companies with no formal framework to show how ministers make their decisions.  \"There may be occasions when it is right for the Government to step in but we have to guard against support being available only to those who have the ears of ministers.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to openness and transparency for the public resources we use to support the Scottish economy and the framework for Scottish Ministers lending to businesses is already set out\u0026nbspin the Scottish Public Finance Manual.  \"As Audit Scotland recognises, the Scottish Government undertakes appropriate due diligence prior to any commitment of funds. We informed the Finance Committee of the loans to both BiFab and FMEL.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend the government had been \"timid\" on stopping cuts and ending Tory austerity.  He said: \u0026ldquoIn the week where we learned that le expectancy has fallen for the first time in 35-years in Scotland \u0026ndash and crime has risen \u0026ndash the SNP should be doing everything it can to improve the lives of people in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than using the money available to them, SNP ministers have simply sat on their hands and done nothing while services suffer.  \u0026ldquoThe fact there is a \u0026pound115m underspend on education, while schools are in crisis and pupils are being failed, is simply unacceptable and will rightly anger parents.\"  Mr Rennie added: \"The Scottish Government should be squeezing their budget until the pips squeak to ensure that every penny is working for Scotland. I\u0027m particularly disappointed that at a time when hundreds of teaching posts are vacant, there is such a dramatic underspending in the education budget.\"  Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes said: \u0026ldquoFor the thirteenth consecutive year, the Scottish Government has demonstrated that we have a firm grip on public finances.  \"Under the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Government is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling expenditure to ensure we live within the budget caps that apply, while maximising spending on public services. Any money which is underspent in a financial year is carried forward in full into the next year and is invested in public services.\"  Ferguson Marine have been asked for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"kezia-dugdale-crushed-after-labour-ended-funding-in-wings-over-scotland-legal-case","story":"  The former Scottish Labour leader said she suffered one of her \u0026ldquolowest personal moments when general secretary Jenny Formby stopped the legal support earlier this month.

It understood Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard this week watered down a demand from his MSPs for the funding to resume.  The party issued a statement saying Labour MSPs gave Ms Dugdale their \u0026ldquofull support and solidarity in her case, but an agreed demand on funding was omitted.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the Wings Over Scotland website, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action brought over her Record column in March 2017.  Ms Dugdale accused him of making a homophobic remark, which he vehemently denies.  The UK Labour party agreed to underwrite the full costs of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence, but after the bill approached \u0026pound100,000, Mr Formby announced she had ended support.  It leaves Ms Dugdale facing signicant legal fees to continue her defence, as well as potential damages and costs owed to Mr Campbell.  The party is now reconsidering its decision after pressure from her supporters and claims of \u0026ldquobetrayal.  Ms Dugdale, who opposed Mr Corbyn becoming leader, said the party supported her under past general secretary Iain McNicol, then stopped it under Corbyn-supporting Ms Formby. She said: \u0026ldquoThe Labour party promised unequivocal support. There was no question mark over it, they were going to support this case.  \u0026ldquoFast forward 18 months - and it\u0026rsquos pretty shocking it\u0026rsquos taken that long to get to the preliminary hearing, we\u0026rsquore not even at the full proof yet - and I had to find out by email from my solicitor that the Labour party weren\u0026rsquot prepared to pay any more legal bills.  \u0026ldquoThe one major factor that\u0026rsquos changed in that time is the general secretary, Jenny Formby.When I found that out by email, I was pretty crushed to be honest.  \u0026ldquoI probably hit one of the lowest personal moments of my le.

Other Tories expressed concern at the unity of purpose shown at the Labour conference this week ahead of their own, which begins in Birmingham on Sunday, and which is set to be dominated by deep isions on Brexit.  Robert Halfon, the former Conservative Skills Minister, admitted: \u0026ldquoSerious stuff from Labour this week that may resonate with millions of workers. Conservatives need a thoughtful response to this at conference.  Writing on the ConservativeHome website, the MP for Harlow in Essex noted: \u0026ldquoDeep social and economic problems remain.

Writing in Westminster\u0026rsquos The House magazine, Mr Gyimah suggested the Tories had \"lost our way\" with business since the 2008 global financial crash.  He argued that while Tories needed to be honest about the failures of capitalism, simply echoing the criticisms of the Left would drive voters away.  \"When we Conservatives veer between talking business down, ignoring voters\u0027 concerns, and telling businesses to shut up - or worse - it is a clear sign we have lost our way,\" declared the Surrey MP.  \"When it comes to our relationship with business, we must unscramble our compass  we are to stand any chance of defeating the hard left.  \"And whichever side you are on in the Brexit debate, we need to realise that  we are not the party of business, then we are nothing.\"  His comments appear in part to be aimed at Boris Johnson and other Tory Brexiteers who have responded dismissively to business warnings about the economic consequences of leaving the EU.  Mr Gyimah stressed that the party was at its best when it was \"pro-enterprise and pro-endeavour\" in a way that made clear its motive was to improve the lot of the ordinary citizen.  \"If all voters hear from us is an echo of the Left\u0027s concerns, and singing from Labour\u0027s hymn sheet, without an enthusiastic and full-throated endorsement of open markets, and without trumpeting our record, we will have only ourselves to blame when they turn away from capitalism.\"  The minister added: \"We can\u0027t out-Corbyn Corbyn, and  we try, we risk offering a pale imitation that leaves people yearning for the real thing.\"  Meanwhile in the same issue, Mr Freeman, Theresa May\u0026rsquos former policy chief, argued: \u0026ldquoWe are living though one of those moments in political history when everything changes.  \u0026ldquoThis is a 1975, 1945, 1905 moment: when the underlying rules of our system of political economy profoundly change.

It is the latest in a series of awards to the charity from the Scottish Government, dating back to 2005 after a co-operation agreement between the the two countries was signed.  In August, the Scottish Government announced that it is to provide \u0026pound11 million to support local projects in Malawi focused on health, education, economic development and renewable energy.  News of the funding boost came as Scottish International Development Minister, Ben Macpherson, was welcomed by pupils to Mpangweni Primary School in Dowa, in the central region of the African country.  Mr Macpherson said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove just seen the remarkable dference Mary\u0026rsquos Meals is making here in Malawi.  \u0026ldquoThey are feeding more than a million children thanks to contributions from across Scotland, including from the Scottish Government.

Earlier this month, the charity said it is now reaching 1,361,586 impoverished children in 17 countries.  Mary\u0026rsquos Meals was founded in 1992 by chief executive Magnus MacFarlane Barrow, with a vision that \u0026ldquoevery child receives one daily meal in their place of education and that all those who have more than they need, share with those who lack even the most basic things.  Mr MacFarlane-Barrow, who comes from Argyll, said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important to us is the hungry child.  \u0026ldquoWhen there are hungry children in front of us today, we\u0026rsquore going to feed them, and at the same time we\u0026rsquore going to work on the solution to getting them fed in the long term, creating a global movement of people who believe in this vision.

Two options to change kerbside waste collections are proposed as part of the revamped collection system and people are encouraged to share their views with the council on this.Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%.Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.

Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.

Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.

It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.

The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Friday 28 Sep 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

She encouraged iniduals and existing businesses to continue the hard work with their projects as entrepreneurialism can come from unlikely sources.Cathy emphasised how the path of an entrepreneur should not be shied away from, that young people and businesses should be encouraged to grow and learn as they develop.Later in the evening, Andy Cameron MBE regaled guests with anecdotes about his le and experiences as an entertainer.Following the dinner, the chamber presented the award for Most Promising New Business 2018 to Ice and Fire Distillery.Chamber chair Stephen Sutherland said: \"This year\u0027s entrants to the new business award showed great potential and it is always heartening to see so much new talent coming through in the local business community.\"With so many great products and services on offer, we look forward to seeing how these businesses develop over this coming year and encourage those that weren\u0027t the lucky winners this time around to think about applying for next year\u0027s award.\"Out of a strong field of entrants, Ice and Fire particularly stood out to the board, with so many developments in a short space of time and a strong set of future plans for investment in the business.\"We were delighted to recognise it as this year\u0027s Most Promising New Business.\"Launched earlier this year by local entrepreneur Jacqueline Black and her family, Ice and Fire Distillery has already seen signicant success with its inaugural gin products \u0026ndash Caithness Gin and Crofter\u0027s Tears.The Ice and Fire team have a strong connection to the local area, representing generations of crofters and gamekeepers, and took the bold step to launch this new enterprise on recognising the need for their crofts to ersy in order to survive.Starting with small copper stills to aid in recipe development, the team quickly moved into small-scale production. Their efforts have already paid off, with demand for their gin exceeding all expectations.The first full-size bottles are expected to be on the market in October, and the team already have ambitious plans to expand into rum and vodka production.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, said: \"The business community of the north Highlands has once again proven its resilience and ambition in the face of continuing political and economic uncertainty.\"This year has given us much to celebrate \u0026ndash from ambitious new businesses taking their first steps to existing businesses growing and ersying into new markets.\"Not only that, we have seen some signicant opportunities for the area move forward over the past year, with work progressing on the Beatrice offshore wind farm, as well as the announcement of the UK\u0027s first vertical launch site in Sutherland.\"Our annual dinner has always aimed to celebrate the business community of the north Highlands, and 2018 has been a great year for the region.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor.

There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotFriday 28 Sep 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgFriday 28 Sep 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to. That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations. My son gave a presentation at the end of the day about the plans for equipment and we were successful getting the maximum \u0026pound2500 available.\"Ullapool Harbour trust also chipped in \u0026pound1000 to the cause.The group set itself an initial target of \u0026pound7000. It then submitted a bid for lottery funding of \u0026pound7500, which it has just been awarded.\u0026nbspIt\u0026rsquos hoped the new equipment could again be located in the tennis court for part of the year.Mr Crook said: \"It\u0026rsquos a facility that was well-received. The company that provides the equipment does a number of layouts so it\u0026rsquos a question of deciding what we can afford and then placing an order. It will, I\u0026rsquom sure, be very well used.\"Friday 28 Sep 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In Scotland, average ratings increased compared to the rest of the UK for \u0027feeling the things done in le are worthwhile.\u0027 This was driven by a higher percentage of people reporting very high levels for this measure.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

A few years later, at the time of the 1983 general election, my teacher asked me  I wanted to play the role of Margaret Thatcher in our class equivalent. I jumped at the chance, and gave a heartfelt speech at the hustings, but ended up with zero votes. I didn\u0026#8217t even vote for myself \u0026#8211 even at that age, we knew it was simply unpopular to be a Tory in the West of Scotland.                 What a turnaround we have seen over the last few decades. We have a growing group of Conservative MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, meanwhile, Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, is polling ahead of Nicola Sturgeon. And we have been joined by 13 brilliant new Conservatives MPs in the UK Parliament. Being a Tartan Tory is back in vogue.            Having spent some of my most formative years here, I know that Scottish people have always been ambitious and entrepreneurial, inidual and innovative, leading the world in ideas and economic progress. If it weren’t for Scots, Conservatives wouldn’t have the ideas, the leaders or the legacy we have today.             In the 18th century, Scotland became an industrial powerhouse, exporting the best of the country to the four corners of the Earth. As time went by, Scotch whisky went global, Scottish tweeds went around the world, and Scottish salmon landed on plates from Asia to America. Paisley became famous the world over for that distinctive tear drop pattern. That national pride and that belief in commerce persists today.With Ruth Davidson offering a bold vision for Scotland’s families, communities, businesses and young people, the Scottish people have come home to a party that is positive about the future. The traditional building blocks of the Scottish economy remain important. For example, in 2017, we had record-breaking whisky exports, with 1.23 billion bottles exported globally, equivalent to £4.37 billion. Anyone who has seen the activity in Aberdeen harbour, where scores of boats come in and out every week, would know that oil and gas is still very important to the economy, supporting 280,000 jobs across the UK.But those powerhouses are being complemented by new industries and capabilities. Across Scotland, the services sector now contributes £50 billion a year to the UK economy. And Scottish exports are growing in all sectors. They were worth more than £28 billion in 2017, up from 2016 when they were worth £24 billion. In the first half of 2018 Scotland has already exported more than £14 billion goods, up on last year.            The innate Scottish intellectual energy is coming to the fore, and entrepreneurs with new ideas are making their way.One example of this is at Codebase, in Edinburgh, where later today I’ll meet just some of the 100 tech firms who call the UKs largest technology incubator their home. It’s the innovative firms under this roof that are the new Scottish success stories.We want those success stories to have maximum impact here in Scotland. That’s why we have updated the devolution settlement to give the Scottish Government freedom to make its own tax and spending decisions. Soon, half the Scottish Government’s budget will be determined by receipts raised in Scotland, which means local people can reap the rewards of their hard work.            The UK government is committed to Scotland by giving it the vital ingredient for success: freedom.We are also giving cities more freedom. Since 2014, we have committed more than £1 billion towards Scotland’s City Deals, giving communities the resources they need to kick-start growth and regeneration and create high-skilled jobs in cutting-edge industries like robotics. While in Scotland I’ll be announcing the Moray Growth Deal, the next step in meeting our aspiration that 100 per cent of Scotland is covered by a deal. This will give local councils and businesses the chance to submit plans to government on their priorities for boosting economic growth and productivity.We are unleashing enterprise by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent in 2010 to 19 per cent today. With greater ability to invest in new equipment and people, businesses have flourished – there are now 61,200 more than when we came to power in 2010. Those new businesses have created wealth and new opportunities for people. Compared to 2010, there are 197,000 more people in employment – that’s more than the population of Aberdeen.

The MSP and former Scottish Labour leader told the Daily Record she felt “crushed” by the decision and that she had “lost the ability to cope” for a few days.            Ms Dugdale is being sued in a £25,000 defamation case by Stuart Campbell, who runs the pro-independence Wings Over Scotland website.            : Kezia Dugdale faces legal bill over Wings of Scotland caseHe took action over an article Dugdale wrote in her Daily Record column in March last year where she alleged he’d sent “homophobic tweets”.Last month Sherf Kenneth McGowan said Dugdale’s article was “capable of carrying the innuendo complained of” by Campbell, and paved the way for a full hearing.Ms Dugdale revealed she only learned financial support had been withdrawn in an email from her solicitors.She also said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has failed to respond to texts she sent him asking for support.            She said former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol had initially promised the funds to take on the case.“There was no question mark over it, they were going to support this case,” Ms Dugdale said.“Fast forward 18 months - and it’s pretty shocking it’s taken that long to get to the preliminary hearing, we’re not even at the full proof yet - and I had to find out by email from my solicitor that the Labour party weren’t prepared to pay any more legal bills.“Safe to say the one factor that’s changed in that time is the general secretary, it’s a woman called Jenny Formby.            “When I found that out by email, I was pretty crushed to be honest.“I probably hit one of the lowest personal moments of my le. I’ve lived through a lot of very stressful situations, I’ve developed coping mechanisms in stressful situations, but I lost the ability to cope with this for a few days.“First of all, how was I going to pay? This could mean my house, my livelihood. You can’t be an MSP  you’re declared bankrupt.”Ms Dugdale could also have to pay Mr Campbell’s legal costs  she loses. She said the Labour party had already spent £90,000 before they withdrew support.“It’s enough to make me really worry about my personal financial security,” she said.            “I had a moment of crisis around how I’m going to pay, and secondly, how could my party do this to me?”Ms Dugdale, who is a regional MSP for the Lothians, said politicians across parties had offered personal support.But she has still not heard back from Mr Corbyn.“Lots of my colleagues have been very supportive, and not only have they given support on a one-to-one basis but they’ve let me know the party membership at large are very angry and very worried about this decision,” she said.“I’m very aware that I’ve upset a few people in the party over the past 18 months or two years, but even some of those people who would no longer consider themselves natural supporters of me and the politics I represent, are still full-square behind me.“I have repeatedly asked Richard Leonard for support. He’s been very supportive recently.“Because this is a real crisis point for me, I’ve been looking for support pretty much wherever I can find it. I twice tried to contact Jeremy Corbyn - someone I used to be in regular contact with, we’d regularly exchange texts - I know he’s read those messages but he’s yet to respond.”Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole Hamilton said: “To make a commitment to financially support a legal action and then to withdraw that commitment without even corresponding that to the person concerned, is utterly reprehensible.“Right across the parliament there is outrage at the way Kez has been treated.”Mary Fee, Chair of the Scottish Labour Parliamentary Group, said: “On Tuesday 25 September, Kezia Dugdale MSP updated the Scottish Labour parliamentary group about the status of the legal action against her. “The Labour group expressed full support and solidarity for Kezia in the case.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806484.1538077998!/image/image.jpg","title":"msps claim over 16m in expenses","story":"                Expenses claimed by MSPs broke through the £16 million barrier for the first time last year, with Holyrood politicians racking up their biggest ever bill.

Many of the claims were for cabs making the half-a-mile journey from Holyrood to Waverley Station. Of a total taxi bill for the year of £14,720, there were an estimated 400 claims for £4 or less.Among those who repeatedly claimed for the journey between Holyrood and the railway station were Labour’s Pauline McNeill and Claudia Beamish, and SNP trio Fulton MacGregor, James Dornan and Sandra White. Last night Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “Being an MSP perhaps does not allow for the healthiest lestyle given the long hours at the office. The walk to Waverley from Holyrood has the potential to be the best bit of exercise they might get in a day. Everyone understands that sometimes the weather can be foul and people might be in a hurry, but it is a shame that so many taxis are being taken.”            : How much did your MSP claim?The MSP who claimed the most was Tavish Scott, the Lib Dem MSP for Shetland, who incurs large travelling expenses as a result of the remote nature of his constituency. Mr Scott’s total, which excluded postage, stationary and staff wages, came to £62,221.In second place was the SNP’s Richard Lochhead, MSP for Moray, who claimed £44,807.He was followed by Orkney MSP Liam McArthur from the Lib Dems with £44,042.

Richard Leonard, who was elected Labour leader in November last year, claimed £9,003.88 as a Central Scotland MSP.Ken Macintosh, who is the Scottish Parliament’s presiding officer, claimed £18,155.29 in 2017-18 for his work as an MSP for the West of Scotland region.A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “The cost of expenses incurred in carrying out parliamentary duties rose by less than the rate of inflation last year.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who

changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8645695.1537799873!/image/image.jpg","title":"go the extra mile to recycle mid and east antrim told","story":"\nMid and East Antrim Borough Council has called on all residents to join the \u0026#8220war on waste\u0026#8221 during Recycle Week, which runs from today until Friday September 28.\n\n                \nHouseholders are being encouraged to “go the extra mile” over the coming days, and to look in those forgotten rooms in the house for recyclable items, including toothpaste tubes, tissue boxes, magazines, deodorants, shampoo bottles and more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nResidents are also being reminded to check the garden shed or garage and get recyclable items down to the local household recycling centre?\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA spokesperson for Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said: “Council’s current household recycling rate is 52 per cent.

Carry a fork/spoon instead of using plastic cutlery. Buy fruit and veg loose, avoiding that plastic packaging.

Have some items you could take to your local charity shop? Most accept clothing, shoes, jewellery, household items including glasses, plates, ornaments, etc.\n\nRecycle - Use your blue bin/kerbie box for recycling plastic bottles, ice cream/margarine tubs, yoghurt pots, biscuit trays and fruit punnets. Bring large plastic items such as garden furniture and toys to your local household recycling centre.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch

It appeared that everyone was from a small town in Northern Ireland, specically Cushendall. \n  \nA year after the reunion a note was sent to the family sharing some of the information and asking  anyone was interested in going to Cushendall. They all agreed and the family found accommodation at Glendale Bed and Breakfast in Cushendall.\n  \nAllen said: “We fell into fantastic luck in reaching the O\u0027Neill family at the Glendale Bed and Breakfast.\n  \n“Eamon and Sorcha quickly helped us find enough room for our family of 12 to spend 10 days in September under one roof.

That was just the beginning of the ways that Eamon and Sorcha went above and beyond to help our family feel at home and welcomed. \n  \n“While we did spend time enjoying the coast of Antrim, we also spent several days researching our family tree.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott.

Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But Tom Smith, who represents Donaghadee and Bangor East, defied his DUP colleagues to see the motion sent to the full council for approval.\n\nHowever, when it was raised at council last night the DUP proposed an amendment that removed plans for the lighting up of the town hall and any inidual reference to the LGBT community, instead making it a general equality motion. \n\nIts amendment was carried with 20 members voting for and 16 against, despite Mr Smith defying his party again. \n\nEighteen of the 40 councillors are DUP, but the support of one UUP, one TUV and an independent member allowed the amendment to pass. \n\nFour councillors were absent for the vote. \n\nIn advance of this week\u0027s meeting, Free Presbyterian ministers had voiced their dismay at what they called the \"offensive proposal\". \n\nIn an open letter to councillors signed on behalf of several congregations, they urged members \"to reject this discriminatory motion\". \n\nLast month there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises. \n\nIn June DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looked at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nSpeaking just after last night\u0027s vote, Mr Muir expressed his bitter disappointment that the motion fell.\n\nHe said: \"This is a real blow to all who believe true equality should not be this hard to achieve in 2018, especially after the recent words of support from Arlene Foster, which have now proven to be very hollow. \n\n\"This motion was about making a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people across our borough, letting them know they are accepted and valued as equal citizens. \n\n\"But instead, those who moved to quash this motion tonight have sent a negative signal that Ards and North Down Council is not dedicated to working for all.\"\n\nHis party colleague Mr Walker added: \"As the father of a gay man, I find it upsetting that some of my council colleagues have taken such a decision - essentially signalling they do not value my son\u0027s contribution to our society. \n\n\"It is completely unacceptable that anyone should be made to feel dferent, but to be made to feel so by politicians who are supposed to stand up for everyone cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\"As a council we had the power to send a strong signal, to make a change that would have brought comfort and support to so many. \n\n\"All those who voted against this tonight have made an uninformed decision.\" \n\nGreen Party councillor Rachel Woods, who backed the move, also voiced her disappointment at the DUP.\n\n\"Diversity should be celebrated. Time for some to wake up and smell the coffee,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley doing an excellent job pm backs secretary of state after northern ireland knowledge gaff","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mums 3k belfast shoplifting","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They are bound by a code of conduct.\n\nThe inquiry has heard claims that some DUP spads were appointed without due process there was a hierarchy among them they were overruling ministers and they were changing documents without the knowledge of their minister.\n\nFormer DUP spad Stephen Brimstone appeared before the inquiry on Thursday to answer questions over allegations of a conflict of interest after he remained in high-level discussions about the scheme, while having applied to it.\n\nHe had served as a DUP spad in several departments before resigning in late 2016.\n\nMr Brimstone was previously in the headlines when he advised social development minister Nelson McCausland.\n\nAllegations then emerged there had been political interference in the running of the Housing Executive.\n\nA report following that probe recommended a disciplinary investigation against Mr Brimstone.\n\nBut to much negative reaction Mr McCausland decided that no further action needed to be taken against his adviser.\n\nThe inquiry’s chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said on Thursday that the rules on appointing and disciplining ministerial advisers is “one of the first things that needs to be looked at”  devolution s in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said: “Assuming the Assembly gets back, one of the first things that requires to be done is that this code needs to be looked at again in terms of whether it is or is not infringed.\n\n“The disciplinary process also has to be looked at again, it has to be looked at in terms of the experience of special advisers to date and in terms of the Northern Ireland public as a whole.\n\n“If it ever does get back into existence, that should be a priority surely.”\n\nMr Brimstone told the inquiry that he felt there is a perception that spads are “a band of iniduals just going and doing as we please”.\n\nHe said this “couldn’t be further from the truth”.\n\n“We are operating to the programme for government, we are trying to deliver on that,” he said, adding that there should be better agreed processes for special advisers to operate within.\n\nThe inquiry has heard allegations that former DUP spad Timothy Johnston was at the top of a hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDUP Councillor Jonathan Buckley with DUP adviser Timothy Johnston at Parliament Buildings in Stormont \n\n\n\n\nMr Johnston served as special adviser to former first ministers Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster from 2007 to the collapse of the Assembly in 2017.\n\nMr Brimstone told the inquiry that Mr Johnston brought expertise that secured “stable government” at Stormont.\n\nHe said “time will tell” how big his friend and former colleague’s “specialist” contribution has been.\n\n“I don’t think anyone really realises what iniduals had to go through at times in this country in order to bring a period of stable government,” he said.\n\nHe added: “This is not a simple place to do government”, claiming there had been intense “brokering” between the DUP and Sinn Fein over “even the smallest issues”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup and sf clash over reports nodeal brexit could see electricity

the near 4,000-strong coalition camp and to provide training and mentoring for Iraqi security forces, preparing them to lead security operations against Islamic State.\n\nThe training company taught their Iraqi partners in a range of areas, from security procedures, basic infantry tactics, le-saving first aid and communications to advanced weapon skills and basic improvised explosive device

And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics.\n\n“Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.\n\n“He stands there with a set of policies clearly aimed at benefiting the vast majority of people in this country and a strategy which will not be dictated to, or influenced by, the five billionaires who own 90% of the country’s media.”\n\nHe added: “Now I’m a ‘Labour party member’ I believe nothing should take our eye off the ball of securing a Labour government under Corbyn.”\n\nThe Liverpool Echo reported that despite ing to the party, Mr Hatton has no plans to run for public office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hilarious footballing meme gives new meaning to key peele sketch","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

securities regulators have filed a complaint against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk alleging that he made false and misleading statements about plans to take the company private in August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission says in the complaint filed on Thursday that Mr Musk falsely claimed in an August 7 statement on Twitter that funding was secured to take the company private at 420 US dollars per share.\n\nThe complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan says that Mr Musk had not discussed or confirmed key deal terms including price with any funding source.\n\n\n\nMusk made his false and misleading public statements about taking Tesla private using his mobile phone in the middle of the active trading day\nSEC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission is asking the court for an order that would stop Mr Musk from being “an officer or director” of any public company.\n\nThe SEC also seeks an order enjoining Mr Musk from making false and misleading statements along with repayment of any gains as well as civil penalties.\n\nA message was left seeking comment from Tesla.\n\n“Musk made his false and misleading public statements about taking Tesla private using his mobile phone in the middle of the active trading day,” the SEC said in the complaint.\n\n“He did not discuss the content of the statements with anyone else prior to publishing them to his over 22 million Twitter followers and anyone else with access to the Internet.”\n\nThe statements, the complaint said “were premised on a long series of baseless assumptions and were contrary to facts that Musk knew”.\n\nShares of Tesla fell 11% in after-hours trading to 273.56 dollars, after falling 2% before the market closed on Thursday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kavanaugh hearing what we learned from testimonies of judge and accuser","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

Mr Kavanaugh denied the accusation.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the extraordinary hearing:\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nChristine Blasey Ford becomes emotional during the hearing \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did Ms Ford say?\n\n\nMs Ford gave a soft-spoken and steady account about what she said happened three decades ago in a bedroom at a small gathering of friends. She said she came forward not for political reasons, but because it was her “civic duty”.\n\nShe described in detail how an inebriated Mr Kavanaugh and another teenager, Mark Judge, locked her in a room at a house party as Mr Kavanaugh was grinding and groping her.\n\nShe said he put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams, and testied: “I believed he was going to rape me.”\n\nThe 51-year-old mother of two said the incident was seared into her mind through trauma, while admitting there were some gaps in her memory around the attack.\n\nMs Ford, a Calornia psychology professor making her first public remarks about the incident, choked up occasionally as she described the alleged attack.\n\nDemocratic senators questioned her directly, but the 11 Republican members on the committee instead chose to have a female sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona question her.\n\nAsked how certain she was that Mr Kavanaugh was her attacker, she declared: “100%.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nBrett Kavanaugh testies before the Senate Judiciary Committee \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did Mr Kavanaugh say?\n\n\nMr Kavanaugh ditched his prepared remarks and instead issued a blistering statement declaring the confirmation process “a national disgrace”.\n\nHe strongly denied Ms Ford’s allegation, but said he believed she had been the victim of a sexual assault. The father of two daughters said one of his girls said they should “pray for the woman” accusing him.\n\n“That’s a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old,” he said, choking up.\n\nMr Kavanaugh’s scorched-earth strategy gave president Donald Trump what he wanted: a nominee willing to fight back aggressively and yield no ground to Democrats.\n\nEchoing Ms Ford, he said he was “100% certain” he did not commit the assault.\n\nAt times, Mr Kavanaugh’s frustrations boiled over. When Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked  he had ever drunk so much he blacked out, he snapped: “Have you?”.\n\nHe later apologised.\n\nMoments after the hearing finished, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Kavanaugh “showed America exactly why I nominated him”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPhoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell questions Christine Blasey Ford \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the prosecutor?\n\n\nRepublicans appointed prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Ms Ford, and she led off the questioning of Mr Kavanaugh. Then she quickly faded away.\n\nAfter Ms Mitchell asked Mr Kavanaugh several detailed questions about Ms Ford’s allegations, the GOP senators took matters into their own hands.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham led the way with a scorching denunciation of Democrats for raising the allegations against Mr Kavanaugh in the final days of the confirmation process.\n\nFrom there, each GOP senator handled his own questions, while Ms Mitchell sat silently nearby.\n\nHours earlier, Ms Mitchell opened her questioning of Ms Ford by expressing sympathy for the professor, who said she was “terried” to testy.\n\n“I just wanted to let you know, I’m very sorry. That’s not right,” Ms Mitchell said.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch speaks to the media after the hearing \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\nRepublicans quickly expressed their determination to move forward. After huddling in the Capitol, senators said the Judiciary Committee would hold a Friday morning vote on whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh for confirmation.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a long-time committee member, said he thinks Mr Kavanaugh will get confirmed by a party-line vote. \n\nRepublicans’ margin for error in the full Senate is slim. If all Democrats oppose the nomination, just two GOP senators would sink Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation  they were to oppose him as well.\n\nMultiple Republican politicians have not said which way they will vote, including two women with reputations as moderates who have been willing to buck their party – Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nMr Graham cautioned them against voting no. \n\n“To my Republican colleagues,  you vote no, you’re legitimising the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"action needed defend public services austerity derry mep tells naples conference","story":"\nA Derry MEP has said democratic action to defend public services is essential in the face of austerity.\n\nSinn Féin\u0027s Martina Anderson was speaking during a conference on austerity and public finances in Naples during a European Parliament study visit, Martina Anderson said:\n\n\"We’re meeting here today a decade after the global financial crisis hit. Of all the wealth created in the world today, 82% of it now goes to the richest one per cent.\n\n\"The bank bailouts, the austerity programmes, the monetary policies of the major central banks, and the failure to stamp out tax dodging by the wealthiest corporations and iniduals, have all contributed to the growing gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n\"The bailout of the banks in the Irish state saddled the people with 64 billion euro of debt. When the Irish government turned to the Troika to be bailed out itself, the Commission, the ECB and the IMF pushed for the privatisation of public goods and services in  as part of their general austerity programme.\n\n\"The North of Ireland also suffered from the austerity policies of the British government. The Tory government,  now propped up by the DUP was never forced by the Troika to implement austerity - they did it voluntarily.\n\n\"But people can act to defend public services. In the south of Ireland the Right2Water movement fought to keep water in public hands. In the North. Sinn Féin Minister Conor Murphy blocked in introduction of water charges. These are examples of democracy in action and we need to see more of that across the EU to continue the fight against austerity.\"\n\nPhoto - Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson speaking at the conference in Naples.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry foster mum shares story hope inspiring others","story":"\nA Derry woman who became a foster carer just over a year ago has shared her story in the hope of encouraging other people to put themselves forward.\n\nKaren , who is a nurse and a mum of two, had always wanted to foster children.\n\nAfter contacting the Western Health and Social Care Trust to find out more out more about the process she decided the time was right was her and her family.\n\n“I had been a nurse for 18 years and I wanted to do something dferent,” she explained.\n\nI had heard the radio ads about the information nights at hotels like the Everglades.\n\n“So I phoned up and asked about it and they sent out some DVDs and brochures and leaflets and I read them all and I started thinking ‘I could do that’.”\n\nKaren met with a social worker to get more information and then went on a six week course to learn more about foster caring.\n\n“They tell you about the really bad cases to prepare you.

She was just perfect and she was adopted by a young couple who couldn’t have children and they’d already adopted her older sister.”\n\nVanessa Nelis, Fostering Recruitment Officer for the Western Trust said there are a lot of misconceptions about who can and cannot foster.\n\n“People often believe these myths.

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods. We need to get this balance right and parents can make a start by reducing their own screen time.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor children aged 2-5, the weekday average was approx. 1 hour 49 mins and 2 hours 13 mins at weekends.  For over 5s, the weekday average was almost two hours rising to more than 3 hours at the weekends.\n\nCaroline Bloomfield, Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Senior Manager at the Public Health Agency said: “Ideally, under 2s should have no screen time while under 5s should have no more than an hour a day. For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens. This doesn’t have to be organised physical activity or sport and all movement counts.\n\nFor more information visit:\n \n\nwww.makeastart.org\n It provides lots of simple ideas on getting active in and around the home and ways to make a positive, healthy start.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys halloween music line set frightfully good","story":"\nThis Halloween promises to be a musical extravaganza with the  of the Samhain Sessions, featuring some of the finest Irish acts performing in the beautul surrounds of Derry’s Guildhall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sessions, which are delivered by Council in conjunction with Celtronic, take place under Luke Jerram’s stunning Museum of the Moon installation, and last year packed crowds turned out to experience the hauntingly atmospheric performances.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8677510.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

a boiler on the lucrative non-domestic RHI scheme \u0026#8211 because he said it also sometimes heats an agricultural shed in which he stores a tractor and fixes machinery.\n\n                \nStephen Brimstone, who left his £92,000-a-year job as a special advisor  to the first minister just weeks before BBC Spotlight’s December 2016 exposé about the RHI scandal, yesterday appeared before Sir Patrick Coghlin’s public inquiry to answer questions about his personal arrangements.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone before the RHI Inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe told the inquiry that he had a domestic biomass boiler which was installed in 2007 to heat his new home, and for which he got a £3,000 government grant, but that just eight years later it was becoming costly to maintain.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was then removed and replaced with a larger biomass boiler on the non-domestic RHI scheme – which provided a far more generous rate of subsidy than the domestic RHI scheme aimed at householders– in the summer of 2015, as the scheme was spiralling out of control.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMr Brimstone installed the boiler in a shed which was used as a garage for vehicles, temporary accommodation for a few sheep, and which he said was an agricultural building – a description accepted by the inspector who set the rates for his house.\n\nCounsel for the inquiry Joseph Aiken said that from the inquiry’s investigations it appeared that what Mr Brimstone had done was within the letter of the RHI regulations  as implemented by Mrs Foster’s department.\n\nHowever, he said the case showed how the legislation was poorly worded, allowing a situation which was unlikely to have been intended.\n\nMr Aiken acknowledged that Mr Brimstone was not running his boiler around the clock, using it on average for four hours a day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

Antrim man who died suddenly in Australia is preparing to hold a service in celebration of his le.\n\n                \nAdam Johnston, originally from Glenavy, took ill at his home in Sydney earlier this month and was rushed to hospital, but passed away a few days later.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAccording to reports, the 32-year-old died as a result of a blood clot.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe father of one was laid to rest in Australia last Friday, and his grieving family has invited those who knew Adam to attend a service in his memory at St Aidan’s Church Hall, Glenavy on Saturday at noon. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Belfast , Adam’s brother Ashley said his infant daughter Lily was “the apple of his eye”.\n\n“He was born to be a dad, he had just changed into dad mode,” Ashley added.\n\n“To me it doesn’t seem real that he has died, it has happened so suddenly.”\n\nAnother brother, Andy added: “He was a very dedicated family man and Lily was his princess.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“He had a happy le, a loving young family, everything going for him.\n\n“Jasmine is trying to be strong for Lily, but some days are worse than others.”\n\nA fundraising page set up to support Adam’s young daughter and fiancee has so far raised over £20,000.\n\nTo donate visit www.gofundme/rip-adam-jimmie-johnston-big-ape\n\n                            \n            \n            \n

change more than 100 lives for the better since it launched a year ago.\n\n                \nThe initiative sees Mid and East Antrim Council, Department of Justice, PSNI, NIFRS and other statutory agencies, working together to help vulnerable iniduals get the right support.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe framework involves representatives from ious agencies meeting regularly to discuss iniduals who may require support and working out how those agencies work together to provide help. The idea has helped people through referrals to the right support services or the passing on of information to direct them to ways to get help.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPSNI Supt Davy Beck said: “Each agency in the hub identies vulnerable people and, with their consent, shares what relevant information they have with the other partners. This helps create a full picture of their particular circumstances. One example is of a young man living alone in a housing executive flat, suffering from mental health issues, alcohol and drug misuse. He had a close family circle, but younger men were taking advantage of him by using his property as a place to deal drugs. The Support Hub was able to help by securing him an appointment with health professionals, substance support services, as well as securing appropriate accommodation. He is now thriving as part of a volunteer group. This shows Support Hubs help deliver the right support at the right time.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMore at www.midandeastantrim.gov.uk/SupportHubs\n\n                            \n            \n
