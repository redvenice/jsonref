Don\u0027t wear a face mask with a valve. The valves mean your face mask is no use for protecting others.\u0027How can the government video not get this right?

Use any cloth face covering over mouth and nose.\u0027Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School with over 20 years experience in communicable disease control and infectious disease management, added: \u0027Just don\u0027t use masks with a valve. \u0027It propels expired breath forcefully and this, as in Bernoulli\u0027s principle, it will travel with greater velocity a lot further. It is not fit for purpose.\u0027The video remains on the government\u0027s Twitter account, where it\u0027s had over 153,500 views, however an additional one has now been shared featuring a woman wearing a mask without a valve.The new video, shared earlier this morning, also states that exemptions to the face covering rule include young children, people with breathing difficulties and people living with a disability. Masks with valves have been banned in parts of the US, including Florida and California. Marisa Glucoft, director of infection prevention Children\u0027s Hospital Los Angeles, previously said: \u0027When you wear a mask with a valve, people around you are not protected because the valve lets all of your breath into the air.\u0027From that perspective, it’s almost like you’re not wearing a mask at all.\u0027The San Francisco Department of Public Health also tweeted in May that masks with valves are \u0027NOT safe\u0027 and \u0027may actually propel your germs further\u0027.The government\u0027s face mask rules descended further into confusion today as Matt Hancock insisted they must be worn to get takeaway coffee but not in pubs.The Health Secretary also denied speculation that Boris Johnson wants to make masks compulsory in offices as part of a drive to convince workers to return.Meanwhile, official guidance published by the government overnight has raised fresh doubts about how it can be policed. Despite the threat of £100 fines, the document says people can have a \u0027legitimate\u0027 excuse for not wearing a face covering if it causes them \u0027distress\u0027.The Police Federation, representing rank-and-file officers, has said it is \u0027unrealistic and unfair\u0027 to expect them to patrol the aisles looking for people breaking the coronavirus regulations.Plea for coronavirus masks in confined spaces spreads confusion | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1798f1fda970361ba93035929024cfd0cb220624/406_292_4706_2824/master/4706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bad25bb92dfc0346af0fcad60206b3","title":"face masks hand sanitiser and table bookings how a pub chain and salon embraced the new normal","story":"From hairdressers to pubs, reopening as lockdown eased required some clever adjustments. Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Can politicians square their differences and agree a €750bn package, or will arguments about shared debts and whether to hand out grants or loans scupper it? “As the ECB switches to the ‘wait-and-see’ mode for the rest of the summer, the focus shift towards the Recovery Fund and the long-term budget. This week’s Summit might not bring a final agreement just yet, but any progress on the most contentious issues, including governance and conditionality, would send a strong signal on the prospects for the breakthrough in the near future.” Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, agrees:“The decision to leave interest rates unchanged and keep the powder dry was no surprise to FX markets. The main area of focus remains on the upcoming leaders meeting in Brussels and the form in which the blocwide support package will take, until then we can expect the euro to keep testing it’s recent upward momentum, particularly against the dollar. “Newsflash from Frankfurt: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows.The ECB is also maintaining its current Covid-19 stimulus package, and repeated its pledge to keep buying assets until next summer: The Governing Council will continue its purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion.These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.The Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. ING economist Iris Pang has hiked her growth forecasts for China, while also warning that the recovery could be bumpy.The biggest risk we see is the technology war, not just with the US but also with the rest of the world. China has put a lot of money into R\u0026ampD in advanced technology to achieve self-reliance on the most advanced semiconductor chips but it will take time to yield results. Ed Moya of OANDA thinks investors are being too pessimistic about the drop in Chinese retail sales: China’s economy is back into growth territory following steady stimulus and relatively strong success in battling COVID-19. The rebound in China however is mostly on the industrial side and not the consumer. The Chinese retail data however is not as bad it seems, as automobiles, catering, jewelry, and petroleum goods were the main categories that posted declines.Reuters is reporting that Nissan will cut its car production worldwide sharply this year, due to the pandemic.It’s another sign that the world economy is weak, with the lockdown denting demand for travel, consumers nervous about big purchases, and production lost to factory shutdowns.Here’s the story:Japan’s No. 2 automaker plans to produce around 2.6 million vehicles between April and December, down from 3.7 million during the same period last year, the sources said.Global automakers are struggling after factories were shuttered earlier this year to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Car dealerships were also closed in many countries, pummelling vehicle sales in March through May, although the fall in sales slowed in June. Nissan employs around 6,000 people at its UK factory in Sunderland, where one worker tested positive for Covid-19 this week.Here’s my colleague Richard Partington on today’s worrying UK jobs data:Paid employment in Britain has plunged by almost 650,000 employees since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March, official figures show, as growing numbers of companies cut jobs.Analysts at trading firm XM also see a V-shaped recovery in China’s GDP figures today:XM, like other economists today, blame the surprise drop in Chinese retail sales in June....But rather than be reassured by the upbeat headline numbers, investors finally seem to be touching base with reality as the warning signs that the global recovery will be a bumpy one continue to grow. Up until now, the resurgence of virus infections in several countries had failed to dent hopes of a speedy and robust recovery. But the slow pickup in domestic demand in China appears to have dealt a major blow to those expectations.Retail sales in China fell on an annual basis for the fifth straight month in June, suggesting consumers are not yet feeling confident enough to revert to their pre-pandemic spending habits.Getting back to the Chinese growth figures, economist George Magnus argues that China is enjoying a V-shaped recovery.The UK is gearing up for a record-breaking year for government debt sales.The Treasury announced this morning that the Debt Management Office will raise £385bn through sales of gilts, from April to November this year -- more than in any year before.The DMO had previously been aiming to raise £275bn in April to August, so this implies another £110bn will be raised in September to November.The higher volume of issuance seen so far this year due to COVID-19 is not expected to persist over the final four months of the year.Yesterday, chancellor Rishi Sunak warned of ‘tough choices’ to address the deficit, which is going to hit a peacetime record in 2020-21. Covid-19 has also taken a chunk out of Europe’s trade surplus.As a result, the EU recorded a €7.1bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in May 2020, compared with €18.6bn in May 2019.The EU’s trade surplus with the UK has also narrowed this year.This has shrunk the EU-UK trade balance from €55.2bn to €38.5bn.

Although the UK government has sought to play down accusations that the decision was politically motivated, insisting it was a “technical decision”, in reality it could scarcely be more political.After repeatedly failing to convince British intelligence services that Huawei posed a national security risk, the US decided to force the UK’s hand by imposing new sanctions that cut off the company from international semiconductor supplies. This left the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre with little choice but to advise that Huawei equipment should not be used in the UK’s 5G network, souring relations between London and Beijing.Washington’s fears about Huawei are genuine. But beneath the rhetoric about national security lies a deeper concern: that China’s economic model may have the potential to rival the productive power of liberal capitalism – and threaten the technological supremacy that has long underpinned US hegemony thanks to its world-leading university, military and tech sectors.After Deng Xiaoping initiated China’s reforms and opening-up process in 1978, most western economists assumed that China would follow the path of other former communist societies: economic liberalisation would be followed by political democratisation, and China would join the club of liberal democracies. But not only has liberal democracy not arrived in the People’s Republic, the Chinese Communist party has developed a distinct economic model that has lifted nearly a billion people out of poverty and transformed China into one of the world’s largest and most dynamic economies.Officially called “socialism with Chinese characteristics”, China’s economic model combines strategic state ownership and planning with market-orientated incentives and a one-party political system. In contrast to most western economies, the commanding industrial heights of the economy are owned and controlled by a vast state holding company that reports directly to China’s state council the financial system is tightly controlled and subordinated to policy objectives and long-term planning and investment decisions are overseen by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission.Huawei has become the international poster child for the success of this model. Although not a state-owned enterprise, the company has received significant support from the Chinese state, including a $30bn line of credit from the China Development Bank. Thanks in part to this support, it has emerged as the unrivalled global leader in the development of 5G networks, and recently overtook Samsung as the world’s largest smartphone maker.Although Huawei is the first Chinese tech company to become globally dominant, it is unlikely to be the last. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, Beijing has made no secret of its ambition for China to achieve self-sufficiency in strategic technologies such as advanced information technology, robotics, aerospace, green vehicles and biotechnology. While the US was happy to encourage China’s economic development when it provided a cheap pool of labour for western supply chains, the goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency has set alarm bells ringing in Washington.The influential thinktank, the Council on Foreign Relations, has described China’s plans as a “real existential threat to US technological leadership”, while the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer acknowledged they pose “a very, very serious challenge”. Strategists fear that allowing China to continue with these plans could lead to the US losing technological supremacy in key strategic sectors such as information technology, telecommunications and artificial intelligence – along with the economic, military and geopolitical power that comes with it.For all the rhetoric about a trade war, rising tensions between the US and China have never really been about trade. From the beginning, the US has been concerned with preventing China’s rise as a rival technological power. In the case of Huawei, the Trump administration’s goal is clear: to crush one of the first Chinese tech companies to become globally competitive, and prevent it from gaining a dominant position in a key infrastructure of the future. This strategy is not without its risks, and could easily backfire. By pressuring countries not to do business with Chinese firms and cutting them off from global supply chains, Washington may end up inadvertently accelerating Beijing’s efforts to develop domestic capabilities in leading technologies, thus fuelling these tensions even further.While talk of a new “cold war” may be overblown, it’s no longer inconceivable to imagine a future where countries can use US technology or Chinese technology – but not both. In the longer term, a shift in this direction could fragment or even unwind the integration of our globalised economy.It’s tempting to view the UK’s dilemma about Huawei as an unfortunate consequence of being caught in the crossfire between two superpowers. But in many ways the UK’s predicament can be traced to its own domestic policy failures. When Huawei was founded in the late 1980s, it was the UK – not China – that was a world leader in telecommunication technology. With homegrown firms such as STC, Racal, GEC, Marconi and Ferranti, the UK was second only to the US when it came to telecoms ingenuity. But in the following decades, successive UK governments allowed leading telecoms technology companies to be taken over and sold off to overseas firms. In thrall to free-market orthodoxy, British manufacturing and industry was sacrificed in the interests of the City of London and the financial sector.While Huawei’s rise is undoubtedly a story of Chinese success, it is also a story of Anglo-American decline. The global financial crisis laid bare the underlying weaknesses of neoliberal capitalism, but without a clear alternative to take its place the response was to double down on a broken model. In the years since, stagnant wages and productivity, and spiralling inequality have fuelled a surge of political discontent on both sides of the Atlantic.If Anglo-American capitalism was already on life support, the catastrophic handling of the coronavirus crisis in the UK and the US has administered the lethal blow. Far from being viewed as successful models to emulate, the US and the UK are increasingly turning into cautionary tales to avoid.None of this is to say that China’s variant of authoritarian capitalism is a desirable alternative, or that governments should turn a blind eye to the abuses of the Chinese state. But rebuffing Chinese technology and stoking anti-China sentiment will not cure the ills of Anglo-American capitalism. The roots of these problems, and therefore their solutions, can instead be found much closer to home.• Laurie Macfarlane is economics editor at openDemocracy and a fellow at the UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0650d6ee9850096d4532a886e50d7075211d15c/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=621ee1ab4201fb9f8d3195798d6b923c","title":"the class of covid 19 meet the school leavers facing an uncertain future","story":"Six months ago, school leavers were looking forward to the usual hedonistic summer before starting work, apprenticeships or further education. Then coronavirus changed everythingFor three years, Ione Gildroy worked on Saturdays in her local library. The 18-year-old from Leicestershire issued and returned books, organised children’s events and stacked bookshelves. She planned to pool her earnings with some compensation she’d received after being in a car accident to pay for her dream gap year: Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bali, Australia. Working in a turtle rehabilitation centre on the Great Barrier Reef. An elephant sanctuary in Thailand.Gildroy booked the trip at the beginning of January. She’d heard of coronavirus then, but wasn’t worried. “I didn’t think it would even slightly affect my travelling plans,” she says. Gildroy looked forward to the summer of her dreams: a joint 18th birthday party with friends and then off backpacking.But then coronavirus hit. Her travel plans were ruined her raucous 18th birthday party was a picnic with her mum and a socially distanced visit to her grandmother’s. “It feels like all the rites of passage you go through when you turn 18 we haven’t gotten to go through,” says Gildroy. “I turned 18, but I haven’t been out for a drink anywhere. We only knew it was our last day of school the day before. We didn’t have to do our exams, sure, but I would have preferred to have done A-levels, and got all the good stuff that goes with it, such as going on holiday or having my prom.”These are strange times for this year’s cohort of A-level students. Schools and colleges closed in March exams were cancelled. Sectors young people would normally seek casual employment in, such as retail or hospitality, have been shedding staff at an alarming rate. Many universities, including Cambridge, are moving to online tuition. Apprenticeship opportunities have largely evaporated. For school leavers, this is a crucial time: deciding whether to travel, work or go to university. The pace of change at the age of 17 or 18 is the equivalent to years as an adult. But now, with plans shattered, these young people are facing a year in limbo.“Everything just feels really uncertain,” says Ben Forrest, 18, from Bradford. Like many others, Forrest had carefully sketched out his summer: two music festivals and a joint birthday party before studying journalism at the University of Leeds. “Before this happened, I was really excited,” he says. “Now I don’t know what to do with myself. When I’m occupied and doing stuff, I’m all right, but when you have those days when you’re not doing owt, it’s not great for the mental health side of things.”Although lockdown restrictions are being eased, there is no timeline for the reopening of clubs and festivals, and many teenagers have lost the part-time jobs they rely on to fund those activities. Forrest has been trying to make the most of the downtime: he is reading a lot and meeting friends in the park. But he still feels pretty down. “The summer between A-levels and uni is meant to be the best time of your life,” he says. “I’ve just spent it in my room.” Among Forrest’s friendship group, the levels of ennui are high. “Everyone is just disappointed, fed up and bored,” he says.Losing your freedom and autonomy just as you are trying to make your mark in the world can feel devastatingly limiting. “Emerging adulthood is the period when people are trying to reach lift-off in their adult lives,” says Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts. “That time is really difficult, and to have that all come to an end, even temporarily, is painful.” He explains that the lockdown will be felt more acutely by 18- to 24-year-olds than any other generation. “You’ve gone through puberty, with the rush of hormones that entails,” says Arnett. “You’re confronting big questions about what you want your future to look like. When you’re thwarted from exploring those questions as you had intended, you’re likely to see anxiety and depression.”Covid-19 has also forced school leavers to make hard calculations about their future: do they push ahead with their university plans or defer for a year in the hope that a vaccine will be made available, and that they will be able to have a more typical student experience? Faced with the prospect of online-only learning and a lacklustre, socially distanced freshers’ week, many students are choosing to defer. “I feel like with university next year, my education will be very halfhearted,” says Jawwad Khan, 18, from London. “Especially when you’re paying £9,250 a year for online learning. It’s like buying an online book over a real book. You’d rather have the real book.”Like Khan, 17-year-old Morgan Davies, from Warrington, is also deferring. He has a scholarship to the University of North Carolina to study economics. “I really wanted the full freshman experience,” Davies says. “I wanted to ‘rush a frat’ and go to Halloween parties.” In anticipation of the college year, he had befriended his roommates online, and socialised with them on Zoom.But Davies’s university is moving to online learning, meaning there will be no in-person lectures or frat parties. At first, Davies thought he could study from his dorm, but the US immigration authorities recently announced that international students would not be allowed into the US if their courses were online-only, meaning that Davies faces the prospect of spending his first year at university in his bedroom in Warrington, studying in US time zones. “For me,” Davies explains, “university is about being physically present … although it wouldn’t affect me academically, being there was a huge part of going to the US. I thought I’d rather delay a year and get the full experience.”Not all students plan to defer. “I’m definitely starting university in September,” says 18-year-old Lily Good, from Aylesbury, who plans to study politics and sociology at the University of Exeter. “I was umming and ahhing, and wasn’t really sure what to do. But things are reopening now, and I’ve spent so much time at home this year. I honestly cannot wait to go somewhere new, meet new people and have a new start in a different place.” Good is optimistic that she will be able to have a relatively normal student experience. “I think that, even if social distancing is officially in place, I can’t imagine 18- and 19-year-old students staying apart, especially in halls and stuff. And, hopefully, the clubs won’t be shut for too long.”Already, there are indications that exam boards may mark this cohort of students harshly. After the international baccalaureate (IB) examiners released its grades this month, online forums erupted in fury: scores of students felt their grades had been unduly marked down, causing them to miss out on university offers. The IB grading body is now being investigated by England’s exams regulator, Ofqual. “I’m stressed,” Finiin says. “I worked so hard for the offer, and I was ready to transition all my efforts into getting the grades. If I don’t get the grades, I don’t know what I’ll do.”If you had banked on entering the world of work via an apprenticeship, now is just about the worst possible time to be a school leaver. “Apprenticeship vacancies have collapsed,” says Kathleen Henehan of the Resolution Foundation. “There were just under 2,000 apprenticeship vacancies in England this May, compared with 13,000 the May previously.” This month, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced incentives for employers to hire more apprentices. “It’s a nice step, but there’s a big question mark as to whether that’s enough to incentivise employers struggling to hire them,” says Henehan.Mason Gunn, 16, from North Shields, left school this year. He planned to find a level-one electrical apprenticeship. “Most companies I’ve spoken to have said if it wasn’t for Covid they would have taken me on,” he says. “They all said the same thing – ‘lack of work due to Covid’ but they would ‘keep me in mind’.” Gunn has phoned or emailed more than 35 local firms, with no luck. “I’m trying to stay positive because I understand that many of these companies are struggling to pull in money, so having an apprenticeship would only make things difficult.”And young people who had hoped to enter the workforce straight away will find themselves on the sharp end of hiring freezes. “School leavers always tend to suffer during recessions because there are fewer vacancies,” Henehan says. “And when firms are hiring, they want someone with more experience.” She explains that during the 2008 crisis, graduates were pushed into jobs previously taken by non-graduates – leaving the non-graduates jobless. “I’m kind of scrambling to get work even remotely related to the field of work I want to do,” says Marianne Zamgoni, 18, from Doncaster.Zamgoni planned to get a job as a trainee estate agent on leaving school: she was getting interviews for positions before Covid-19 hit, and then everything dried up. She has applied for 50 jobs in the past three months, with no luck. “I have signed up for every job website under the sun,” she says, “and whenever I get an alert about a new job post, I apply for it.” All the firms who come back say the same thing: they’re on a hiring freeze. Zamgoni is trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard to not be dispirited. “It can be quite depressing every time you open an email and it says: ‘Sorry to inform you …’” she says. “My future feels very uncertain.”The Resolution Foundation recently predicted that more than a million young people would be unemployed in the coming years. “I wouldn’t want to be 18 right now,” sighs Henehan. “In terms of the labour market, it’s too soon to tell if this recession will be worse than it was in the 1980s, where we had mass youth unemployment, but it’s possible … it certainly looks more challenging than the 2008 financial crisis. At least in this century, this is the worst time to be a young person.”Being 18 right now can feel a little like being a member of a cursed generation. “We’ve had it so bad,” says 18-year-old Aisha Akram from Manchester. “We had the new GCSEs, when there was a new curriculum and no past papers. And now Covid.” Akram, who plans to study psychology at the University of Manchester next year, worries about her generation’s long-term prospects with a recession looming. “It’s probably going to be really hard to get a job when I graduate,” she says. Some of Akram’s friends think deferring will improve their job prospects – the labour market should be in better shape by then – but Henehan says that is far from certain: “If everyone stays in education a bit longer, they all exit en masse, and will be competing for the same jobs.”Finiin’s friends have started jokingly referring to themselves as the “class of Covid-19”. “I remember our economics teacher joking about coronavirus in January, and everyone was laughing,” Finiin says, “and then – bam! – we were all locked down in our houses and school was cancelled.

I think we’ll look back in a few years and think: ‘Wow, how did that happen?’”But Akram is confident that the class of Covid-19 will emerge victorious, pointing to the Fridays for Future climate crisis movement and the recent Black Lives Matter protests as evidence of Generation Z’s commitment to making a positive impact on the world. “All these protests will equate to something,” Akram says. “We’ve been hard done by, but in the end we will come out stronger. Our generation is going to make a big change in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/823b41c7109656ae2087efbc7aec4616dc77866a/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=944e3f23da8c9abe24ff6a6b25f97d29","title":"climate change made siberian heatwave 600 times more likely study","story":"Human fingerprint on record temperatures ‘has rarely, if ever, been clearer’, says reportThe record-breaking heatwave in the Siberian Arctic was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused climate change, according to a study. Between January and June, temperatures in the far north of Russia were more than 5C above average, causing permafrost to melt, buildings to collapse, and sparking an unusually early and intense start to the forest fires season. On 20 June, a monitoring station in Verkhoyansk registered a record high of 38C. An attribution study shows such prolonged heat over the first six months of the year would have been almost impossible without the effect of greenhouse gas emissions from industry, transport and farming.The team of researchers from international universities and meteorological services, including the PP Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in the Russian Academy of Science, calculated this human impact added at least 2C of warming to the region.The authors of the study say the Siberian heat would happen less than once in every 80,000 years without human interference.Andrew Ciavarella, a lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the Met Office, said the findings were staggering. “This research is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming global climate. Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”Scientists say the human fingerprint has rarely, if ever, been clearer. “This is the largest signal we have seen,” said Friederike Otto, the acting director of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute and a co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative. “This study shows again just how much of a game-changer climate change is with respect to heatwaves. As emissions continue to rise, we need to think about building resilience to extreme heat all over the world, even in Arctic communities – which would have seemed nonsensical not very long ago.”Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique\u0026nbsplast year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.The need for stronger resilience was evident when melting permafrost and poorly maintained equipment led to one of Russia’s worst oil spills, from a power station near the industrial city of Norilsk, on 29 May.Prof Olga Zolina, of the Institute of Oceanology in Moscow and another lead author, said the fate of Norilsk could be an indicator of what lies in store for other northern communities. “It means we should do something. This town is very small, with about 1,000 inhabitants. But there are other bigger cities in the Arctic circle. For them the mounting high temperatures are very important.”Concerns are also growing that the high temperatures are worsening positive feedback loops by melting heat-reflecting ice and increasing the range and intensity of wildfires in Siberia, which is home to the world’s largest forest.The season’s fires started unusually early, in April, and have been detected further north than ever before. According to the EU’s Copernicus satellite monitoring service, Siberian blazes released 59 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in June, the highest amount on record.Nasa says some embers smoulder through the winter in peatlands and then flare back to life in the spring. The dangers of such “zombie fires” is increased by warmer temperatures. The melting of the tundra also increases the risks of a release of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Since the middle of June, the extent of the fires has more than doubled to more than a million hectares.The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, but the trend towards more extreme conditions is apparent elsewhere. At the start of the year, Australia had unprecedented bushfires and Antarctica registered exceptionally high temperatures. The UK Met Office is more cautious. Despite several record months, it said global average surface temperatures in 2020 were still not at 2016 levels and a cooling La Niña was now developing. “While 2020 is running very high, there is no guarantee of a record this year,” said Prof Adam Scaife, the head of Met Office long-range prediction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c686a50667410ec40973b7738e9e12334657d787/0_3_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=efc15c9dd024b1929ad9109259d6c125","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

Clara (Isabél Zuaa), an unsmiling mystery women, arrives at the luxurious São Paulo apartment of pregnant Ana (Marjorie Estiano), to be interviewed for the position of nanny. But is that really the role on offer? And is Clara an entirely honest applicant?The first third of this two-hour-plus film keeps us wondering. It’s clear that something is off between the women, but impossible to determine where the balance of power lies. Is this a Rosemary’s Baby-style horror about satanic foetus worship? A Parasite-like study of the subversive intimacy between domestic servant and employer? Or some unholy combination of the two? Then, with all the sprightly mischief of one of Ana’s country-music workout videos, the plot dances off again, in an entirely different direction.To say any more would be to ruin the unpredictable pleasures of a genuinely surprising film, but everything Good Manners does – from lesbian sex scenes to furry animatronics – it does with elegance, humour and in shades of moonlit blue. Rui Poças’s painterly cinematography turns the tower blocks of a modern city into a kind of enchanted wood, complete with its own take on the big bad wolf from the storybooks.Clara proves as hard to ruffle as she is to read, a quality that is sorely tested by the film’s events. Some may appreciate a strand of body horror that relates specifically to the female body and motherhood. More squeamish viewers can be reassured that these grisly moments are rare and interspersed with musical numbers. Also contained within the story is a heartwarming and timely tribute to care workers, both unpaid and underpaid. This satisfyingly strange film really has it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b2456042cb68fc0facb5e120b4658703b596ce/141_508_3336_2001/master/3336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30b2c73eafad719055823d12be500e84","title":"kim joys recipe for a dinosaur cheesecake","story":"The custardy interior and caramelised crust of a burnt Basque cheesecake create a ‘volcanic’ landscape – perfect for this Jurassic-themed dessert Spanish burnt Basque cheesecakes are very popular right now as it’s one of those recipes that can’t go wrong.

Nineteen years ago they made it to the Champions League semi-finalsBy The Coaches’ Voice for the  Sport NetworkIt was very frustrating at the start of the 2000-01 season. We just couldn’t get going. We lost to Manchester City and drew with Coventry, two teams that ended up getting relegated, and then drew against a Derby side that just avoided relegation. At that stage we were missing a lot of key players due to injury, though. I felt that, once we got all our players back and the new players had bedded in, there really was great potential in the team.The ambition for the season was to get into Europe again and improve on the previous year, when we had finished third in the Premier League and made it to the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup. The title was out of the question – there were more capable teams than us – but I knew we had a special team and the club just wanted to see improvement on the pitch.Thanks to the sale of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Atlético Madrid a year earlier, we were able to invest in players. I’d been to Scotland to watch Mark Viduka playing for Celtic a few times and knew he would be perfect for us. He was a big, strong forward who could hold the ball up and someone we could play off, but he could also score plenty of goals. I was never involved in the financial side of things, but I told the board for the money – around £7m – he was absolutely perfect for us and they agreed. We got him and he turned out to be one of my best ever buys.Then there was Olivier Dacourt, who I’d been impressed with when he was at Everton. I thought he would be ideal for us. It was then about getting him to come to Leeds and selling him the dream of what he wanted to do. Again, we got our man – Olivier was another brilliant signing who improved the team.We’d made that poor start to the season domestically and we also had a tough draw in the Champions League qualifying round, against 1860 Munich. We weren’t playing well, but we managed to scrape through over two legs after a brilliant 1-0 away win in the second leg.We got Barcelona, Milan and Besiktas in the first group stage, and we didn’t have our players back from injury in time for the first game – a daunting trip to the Nou Camp. Anybody can go to Barcelona and get beaten, but if you go there with a young team like ours and missing six first-team players, you’re in trouble. To have any chance you need your full team out, but we didn’t have that – and it turned out we were in a lot more trouble than I’d predicted.We got absolutely hammered. We were 2-0 down inside 20 minutes and ended up losing 4-0. Some people behind the scenes were in a panic after that game, but they didn’t understand what Barcelona was or the problems we had. It was our first game as a young team going to a club like that and we did it with half a squad. For all I was gutted we’d got beaten, I knew there were reasons behind it.I knew we were a lot better than that result made out, so I knew we would improve – and we did. We went unbeaten for the remaining five games of the first group stage, beating Milan at home and getting a draw away, as well as drawing at home to Barcelona.So we qualified for the second group phase, where we were drawn against Real Madrid, Lazio and Anderlecht. Three capital cities. We went to some amazing places – Munich, Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Barcelona, Milan, Istanbul – all in one season. The great thing about that squad was that they were young and a bit naive. So they were totally fearless and really, really brave. We had some great young players. Players like Jonathan Woodgate, Harry Kewell, Alan Smith and Stephen McPhail, who could handle the pressure of playing in the biggest games.They weren’t experienced and never overanalysed things. They relished the big occasions and they would never freeze, even on the biggest stages. We would train on the pitch before an away game and you could just tell the players were inspired by playing in the biggest, most famous stadiums on the planet and what had happened at these venues. From the Bernabéu to the San Siro, they wanted to be part of the stadium’s history.We added another unbelievable young player in November, when we signed Rio Ferdinand from West Ham. We had a brilliant leader in Lucas Radebe – but he was struggling with his knee, so the club asked me for three options to recruit, all at different prices. I said Rio was the top one we could get, but I told them he would cost about £10m. I was actually quite shocked when they told me we were signing him for £18m – I might even have expressed doubts if I’d been asked about it – but they were convinced. He was already a world-class player and he proved to be an incredible signing.Real Madrid beat us at Elland Road – Raúl and Fernando Hierro got the goals – and then we went to Rome to play Sven-Göran Eriksson’s special Lazio side, who had won Serie A the year before. Viduka was as good a centre-forward as anyone in Europe that night and we got a result, winning 1-0 through an Alan Smith goal 10 minutes from time. That was a great occasion and Sven was very complimentary afterwards.We were still struggling with playing in Europe and keeping up our league form, though. We were a young group learning on the job, but we were expected to do what Manchester United and Arsenal had been doing for years. After a big European night and the travel, we were tired and often struggled to refocus. After the win in Rome, we went to Southampton on the Saturday, played really poorly and lost.We got very lucky against Anderlecht in our next European games, though. By the time we played them in back-to-back Champions League matches in February, we had the weekend in between off because we’d already been knocked out of the FA Cup. We didn’t play well in the first game at home but we dug out a win, coming from behind with two late goals. Then we had the whole weekend to prepare for the second game, with the experience and the lessons of that first game fresh in our minds.Olivier Dacourt heard that the Anderlecht coach had said we were lucky in that first game and that our players were overrated, so when he told the rest of the squad about that it was a great motivation for the return game. The players always had a great attitude, but that gave them added incentive. Our performance in Brussels was probably one of our best in my entire three years at Leeds. We won 4-1 and completely annihilated them. It all came together perfectly.Three days later, we went to Tottenham and won – and won well. That was particularly pleasing. It was always going to be a tough game. They were managed by former Leeds manager George Graham, who I was managed by at Arsenal and was assistant to at Leeds. So they – and he – really wanted to win, but we proved we were learning how to maintain our Premier League form after coming back from a European game.We were on a hell of a run, and played superbly to beat a really top-class Deportivo La Coruña in the quarter-finals. We played our best football for a full 90 minutes in the first leg, with a great atmosphere at Elland Road. We won the game 3-0, with goals from Ian Harte, Smith and Ferdinand.I knew it wasn’t over, though. Deportivo were a team that scored a lot of goals and we faced an onslaught in the away leg. We got a right lesson in that return game, but we only lost 2-0 and clung on – deservedly – to progress.We’d started off in August against 1860 Munich and nobody would have believed in May we’d be playing a semi-final against Valencia. Of course it was very disappointing when we lost to them, but I was so proud of the team. Valencia were a very, very experienced team – they’d got to the Champions League final the year before and had knocked a very good Arsenal side out in the previous round.We had played loads of games over the course of the season, but fatigue didn’t come into it. We were just beaten by the better team over two games. The players had overachieved massively, and I was lucky to have had that group. We made it so near, but just couldn’t make that final step. We finished the league season strongly but missed out on the Champions League places by a point, so we didn’t have the chance to go on another run like the 2000-01 season.It was a real pity we never won anything. A bit like Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, with the team we had at that time, we really should have won a trophy. We’d put together a really top group of lads who wanted to play the football I asked them to play, and they were full of hunger.Even though we didn’t win anything, the Leeds supporters were always behind me. I cannot believe the way I’m treated by them, even now. They always let me know they were on my side. That run to the Champions League semi-finals built a bond between us that will always be there.• This article was published first by The Coaches’ Voice• Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd4ab8dff9187ab9737cbc5aca6836a4b70df3b2/0_63_1872_1123/master/1872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f7e392f662190c4c868e3208744586","title":"jack charlton a giant fish and the memories that make us love sport","story":"News of the World Cup winner’s death led me down an unexpected and moving path that captured the joys of footballIt’s Saturday at 8.45am. I’m sitting three metres away from my TalkSport co-presenter, Charlie Baker, who is in turn sitting three metres away from our producer, Joe. We are trying to come up with a vaguely amusing text subject for our show that starts in 15 minutes. We settle on village cricket anecdotes – back after months, it’s a goldmine of funny stories.I tweet out a question and the answers start rolling in – a guy whose mum insisted he wear a bike helmet while fielding, a model aircraft crash-landing into the umpire’s leg and a team with five volunteer fireman who all left the field when a call came in.Our guests are booked – Dean Ashton to preview Norwich v West Ham, Brian Deane on Sheffield United among others.It’s 8.47am. Tony Cascarino – host of the Weekend Sports Breakfast – pokes his head out of the studio to tell us the sad news about Jack Charlton. It won’t be announced until 9. We have 10 minutes to cancel our plans and set up a show to pay tribute Big Jack – one of 11 men to win the World Cup for England and who transformed the game in Ireland.Cascarino has to go back on air, and run through a Premier League preview, despite knowing that his friend and one of the biggest influences of his career has just died. Landlines that haven’t rung for weeks ring. Has someone made an obituary? Where is it saved? Will it be ready in nine minutes? Pre-made obituaries seem slightly cold and callous. There are meetings about who we expect to die in the next few weeks, months or years. Anyone renowned and approaching 80 has a ready-made obit on the shelf – whether in print or packaged up for TV and radio.It’s 8.51am. To my shame, there’s so much I don’t know about Jack Charlton. I knew he was part of that Leeds side – but not that he was a one-club man. I knew nothing of his short-lived stint as a miner, nor of his managerial achievements at Middlesbrough or Sheffield Wednesday.It’s 8.59am. We break the news. Meanwhile, producers have the unenviable task of trying to get in touch with potential guests. I genuinely don’t know if we have the right to be the bearers of this news. We contact Mick McCarthy. He graciously agrees to come on. It is hard to hear him tell us that our message “knocked him sideways”.Mick is on hold while Shane, an Irishman who’s called in, talks about sharing a joke with Jack on a plane. “He was a great man, I know there’ll be a lot of people in tears and in mourning – he was the best thing to happen to us.”The whole tone of the programme is set by Cascarino – who stays with us after his show has finished. He is joined by Ray Houghton and they tell some wonderful stories, touched with humour and love. Ray’s voice cracks. Suddenly it feels like we’re in a pub remembering a mate – not getting all the facts right, but it doesn’t matter.“We ended up going to Harry Ramsden’s the day before a game and doing the Harry Ramsden’s challenge,” says Cas. “It was giant fish ’n’ chips and sausage and pie – the whole team ate it and we played, was it Liechtenstein? I think it was Liechtenstein?”“No, we actually lost 3-1 to Poland the following day at Lansdowne Road,” Houghton interjects. “In Harry Ramsden’s at that time there was this massive big fish and if you finished it you got it for nothing and Gary Kelly finished the lot off – and he got absolutely mullered the next day by Toni Polster – ah that’s right it was Austria. Did he get a hat-trick?”“I can’t remember but he didn’t have to do much,” replies Cas. “We couldn’t move,” shouts Ray.It feels like the laughter echoes out of the studio. It turns out Polster got two in that 3-1 win after Cascarino and Houghton had combined to put Ireland 1-0 up early in the second half. The affection in their voices is joyous.Barry Glendenning comes on. He is genuinely moved. Those who listen to the  Football Weekly have rarely heard his emotional side – nor have those who’ve worked with him for the best part of a decade. “He wasn’t just admired. He was loved. The day we beat England in Stuttgart in 1988 is still one of the greatest day’s of my life. I’m kind of surprised by how affected I am.”It takes moments like this to realise what sport is really for. What the actual point is. When you step back for one moment. Amid the hours and hours of mindless transfer gossip, fake rage about VAR, and where shoulders begin and arms end. Added to real concern about where the money comes from and where it goes. And real rage about the racism and homophobia that doesn’t end.But why do any of us love sport? It’s our memories of moments, of times spent with family and friends – where we were, who we were with, what we did. It moves us and it defines so much of us – more than we probably realise.Jack Charlton moved so many in life. And even this Saturday morning, hours after he has passed away in his sleep, he is moving us again.It’s 11am. Game day begins. Football stopped for a pandemic, but it doesn’t stop for one man. I am thankful to all those people who came on, despite their sadness, to express themselves so well. I hope, in a tiny way, we did Big Jack justice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ecd8944d05d77e5c09b1c7e367989d257a3a7d6/0_0_4917_2949/master/4917.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9f747a54f0cedcda6f963b0a2c19e850","title":"i was 18 hugged first time sister souljah activist","story":"I had grown up in brutal poverty, and saw touch as a privilege for those with less traumatic backgrounds. Then a friend and mentor changed my lifeWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesIt happened one day during my first year of college at Rutgers University, in my home state of New Jersey. The anti-apartheid movement was raging on my college campus, there was still a massive buzz about Jesse Jackson’s first run for president and I had instantly become woke, as we say, because of names such as Winnie and Nelson Mandela, because of the Aids and crack epidemics, and because of my adopted big sister on campus, an older student named Lisa Williamson, who would later become the famed activist and bestselling author Sister Souljah.For sure, Lisa was one of the most incredible speakers I had ever heard. She was a fearless leader, and I became so instantly fond of her, I even called her “Ma” just like I did my own mother. And she adored me, taught me and shared with me everything that she knew and was learning, in real time.On one of those many occasions we were together, as we were about to part ways, Lisa did something she had not done before: she leaned in to hug me goodbye and I recoiled with unimaginable terror, my body trembling. Lisa was stunned, asked me what was wrong, and I was profoundly embarrassed by my reaction. I said nothing.“You have never been hugged before, have you?”My 18-year-old eyes tumbled to the ground, along with my self-esteem. I felt weak, exposed and shook my head “no” so slightly that it could barely be seen.“Well, I am going to keep hugging you until you get used to it. You cannot live like that, Kev, afraid of people hugging or touching you.”And with that Lisa was gone, as I stood there still staring at the asphalt, my sweaty palms shoved deeply into my pockets.It was the first time I had been confronted about my fear of physical touch. I was raised by a single mother in brutal poverty, no father and no father-figure those first 18 years of my life, and my ma did the best she could with what she had. But there were no hugs, no kisses, no I love yous – never. The only touching I ever received from my mother were the severe beatings whenever I was “bad”, sometimes when I was awake, sometimes when I was asleep.This went on from birth until I was about 11 or 12 and finally taller than my mother. But the emotional and verbal assaults never ended. So somewhere in my mind I had come to associate touching with violence, with someone trying to hurt me, and it would take several years of therapy, and mighty and consistent spiritual work, for me to forgive my mother, to understand that she was simply doing to me what had been done to her by her father, by our society.Touching, hugging was a privilege reserved for those who had lives that were not traumatic like ours. Touching, hugging was for people who were “weird”, different, like the Puerto Rican kids I would observe from a distance at my Jersey City grammar school openly offering love and affection to each other. As a youth, I was stunned by their behaviour it was foreign to me, and I could not imagine someone, anyone, touching me.Yet little did I know that, in time, because of that singular act by Sister Souljah when I was 18, that I would fall in love with hugs, with touch.It would happen slowly, through my 20s and 30s, and into my 40s, this love of touch, of hugs. It would come as I would get over my dread of holding a girlfriend’s hand in public. It would come as I would learn, from a woman, from women, the difference between having sex and making love. It would come as I cried my eyes out in therapy session after therapy session over the course of three decades about the many traumas of my childhood. It would come to me as an activist, as a public speaker, when complete strangers would touch my shoulder, my elbow, my back, grab me, hug me, as a sign of appreciation. It comes when I try to touch my mother, on her shoulder, on her elbow, on her back, when I try to hug her as a sign of forgiveness and she recoils, as I had done long ago, with Sister Souljah but I keep trying, hoping, praying that my mother, in her late 70s now, will finally allow herself to be touched or hugged, with love.So here I am, sitting in my Brooklyn apartment, alone, during this pandemic, craving the presence and energy of human beings so intensely that it has left me in a flood of tears pretty much every single week.Touching is magic for the soul, it is healing. I ache badly now, as I did during the first 18 years of my life, because I do not have it, because I am just newly orced from my wife after 12 painful months of separation and loneliness. I will have touch again, this I know, but I wonder, daily, when? This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

And at Manchester City it’s been raised to another levelWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesThere is a shared ecstasy when the ball hits the back of the net – an unleashing of joy, passion, scarves and primal screams. You probably have nothing in common with your fellow huggers apart from supporting the same team and wearing identical replica shirts. In fact, you may dislike them in real life, and there is a good chance that you will never see them again. It is an extraordinary, unlikely bonding.But the Poznań is something else. Fans of the Polish club Lech Poznań introduced it to Manchester City supporters during a Europa League match in 2010. They turned their backs on the game, wrapped their arms around the shoulders of the supporters on either side of them and repeatedly jumped up and down on the spot in unison. It was a beautiful sight – random, surreal, rhythmic, funny, collective – and utterly senseless.The history of the Poznań is much debated. Some say it started in Poland in the early 60s as a protest by fans against club management others say it originated in Turkey and Greece, and was known as the Grecque. For Manchester City fans, though, it will always be known as the Poznań. After that match against Lech Poznań, we paid homage to its supporters by stealing their crazy hug-dance. We customised it by chanting “Let’s all do the Poznań” to the tune of Do the Conga.It was open to any number of meanings or none. We Poznańed in triumph after scoring, we Poznańed when we were bored, we Poznańed when we were rubbish. Turning our back on the football could be interpreted as supreme confidence (we knew we would win), despair (we knew we would lose) or indifference. Sod the footie, we were there for the craic. It was ludicrous, but it was also an act of love, trust and solidarity. A Poznań did not allow for party-poopers or mavericks (even though it was a maverick act). If one person broke the chain, the Poznań was ruined.Even pre-lockdown the football hug was in danger of disappearing. VAR (the video assistant referee) has taken the spontaneity out of football: rather than hugging when our team scored, we started checking the TV screens to see if a goal really was a goal or just another shattered hope.Meanwhile, the pandemic has robbed us of the opportunity to Poznań. Indeed, common sense may dictate that we never see it again. But football being football, and City fans being City fans, I have a sneaky feeling that when we are finally allowed back into football grounds, we may just celebrate with the most audacious, prolonged Poznań ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd4a87765f892fc784ccf95c7cf1fddd32028c7/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cf4eaf7ecd552d8c7ba318b627c20c","title":"rents rise in england but slide in london as covid 19 affects market","story":"Property website Rightmove said rents outside London hit record £845 a month in early JulyRents have continued to climb across England, but they are sliding in London as Airbnb owners abandon hopes of attracting holidaymakers and put their properties on the long-term rental market.The Rightmove data records asking prices for new properties to rent on its website, and is more volatile than figures from the Office for National Statistics.Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: “The pause in the rental market has led to some distorted figures over the past few months, especially in cities where landlords with short-term lets made the swap to instead try to find a long-term tenant.”He predicted that the legacy of coronavirus will be more tenants seeking a spare room and a garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c7fdb070b7277ccc22eb633bb21ff3fef299e1/0_1800_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961775cab4953c19ffde424d49e6815d","title":"we paid 2227 for our move to france and it got us nowhere","story":"It all went wrong from the start with Doree Bonner … and now we’re having to chase the ombudsmanMy partner and I relocated to France last year and paid moving firm Doree Bonner £2,227 to handle things, which went wrong from the start.

Eventually, Doree Bonner told us it bore no responsibility for what went wrong and offered us £1,000 as a gesture of goodwill.We refused and contacted The Furniture Ombudsman, which took over nine weeks to rule in our favour and award us a payment of £2,657.93.

They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment. That has all changed after China imposed a harsh new security law in Hong Kong and now the UK government is preparing to backtrack on an agreement to use the Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G infrastructure.  ’s leader writer Tania Branigan tells Rachel Humphreys that this new phase in relations is going to be difficult for the UK. Last week, Beijing’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, warned: “China wants to be UK’s friend and partner. But if you treat China as a hostile country, you would have to bear the consequences.” It comes as pressure mounts on China internationally to be open about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic first seen in Wuhan at the end of last year, and increasing outrage at the treatment of Uighur Muslims. But there is an acceptance too in government that even if the ‘golden era’ is over, China remains a vital trade relationship as well as a crucial player in global affairs, not least the battle to reduce carbon emissions.

The committee is regularly briefed by the security services and considers some of Parliament’s most sensitive information.Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members.The committee confirmed on Thursday it would publish the report into Russian interference in UK politics before the summer recess.In a statement, Lewis said the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members.“It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair,” he said.“I did not reply as I considered it an improper request. At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate,” he said.A senior government source had explained Lewis’s ejection from the party by saying he “has been told by the chief whip that it is because he worked with Labour and other opposition MPs for his own advantage”.Johnson nominated five Conservative MPs for the committee last week – giving them a majority – and Grayling was widely expected to become chair.Sources said he and the government were “surprised” by Lewis’s decision to stand.Lewis, the MP for New Forest East since 1997, has twice chaired the House of Commons’ defence select committee. He was described by the former national security adviser Peter Ricketts as someone “with much wider experience of defence and security”.In Thursday’s statement, Lewis said Johnson had no right to dictate who chairs the committee.“The 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to committee members. I remember this well as I served on the committee from 2010 to 2015,” he said.“There is no other Conservative MP in the House of Commons with any past experience of working on the ISC.”Lewis’s chairmanship has paved the way for the Russia report, which was sent to Downing Street in October, to finally be released.The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election.Following speculation the new committee chair, who was widely expected to be Grayling, could delay it further or rewrite it, a short statement from the committee said it would be released within days.A spokesperson for the ISC said: “The committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess.”The government could seek to remove Lewis from the ISC by tabling a motion to replace him in the Commons, which MPs would have to approve.This tactic could run into trouble. Lewis has many allies on the Tory benches, including those who support increased defence spending.One senior backbench MP told the  Lewis had charm, a quality that many of Johnson’s advisers lack. “Julian Lewis knows how to work the tearoom in a way that Dominic Cummings, who has insulted most MPs at one time or another, has never quite worked out.“When he stood to become chair of the defence committee, he would produce his own handmade leaflets – including photos of himself wearing Navy uniform – and walk MPs to the voting booths with a smile and a pat on the back. People like him.”Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, criticised the decision to remove the whip from Lewis, tweeting: “Completely self-defeating act that bears the hallmark of a government so arrogant it really believes it is above scrutiny.“What is in the Russia report that Johnson doesn’t want to see the light of day?”The former Tory cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the intelligence and security committee, Dominic Grieve, told BBC’s Newsnight: “What troubles me about this episode – quite apart from its utter absurdity, and now withdrawing the whip from Julian, who is indeed highly respected – is the mindset it gives about what on earth is going on in Downing Street.“Why did they try to manipulate this process? They shouldn’t have done.“The committee can only exist, the committee can only be respected ... if it is seen to be non-partisan and independent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2209648c1c203d9971562c0d0c4ffa96d00294/0_228_5457_3273/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e291ca5ebedbea3aafd3638c97d886ef","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

There’s much to savour from a life, and football career, well lived. Starting with his honour-filled Leeds years, which he also discusses here with Jeff Stelling alongside Paul Reaney and Norman Hunter, including the tale of his first England call-up. His finest hour in an England shirt, of course, came in 1966. More achievements followed as a manager, at Middlesbrough, for whom key figures pay tribute here, and at Sheffield Wednesday, whom he also led to promotion.Honorary Irish citizenship ensued after he then took the Republic to unprecedented heights, first at the 1988 European Championships – when they beat England and Ronnie Whelan scored this sensational goal against the Soviet Union – and then at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. So you’ll be wanting Packie Bonner’s save in Genoa and Ray Houghton’s fairytale of New York then. At Italia 90, Charlton’s team also met the Pope, which he chats about to Colm Meaney here. Four years later, Ireland reached the knockout stages again though not without some losses of temper.

The race was first run in 1936 but it made history when the 1986 edition was the first held in the old Eastern Bloc. Nelson Piquet took the victory, pipping Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell to top place on the podium. In recent times it has been dominated by Lewis Hamilton, who first won in Hungary in 2007 and became the most successful driver in the circuit’s history with his seventh win in the race last year.6) Don’t look down.1) Relaxing on the couch – or perhaps not.2) The art of the juke, as demonstrated by a selection of NFL and college players.3) Last week’s Ennio Morricone-inspired discussion of World Cup 1978 music prompts an argument in favour of the BBC’s theme for the tournament.4) IndyCar restart bedlam, featuring pile-ups, inappropriate hand gestures and more.5) A Japanese-language documentary about Shunsuke Nakumura’s time at Celtic, featuring a visit to a young Kieran Tierney’s house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c8e0b24283ec133eff67d5102a73da88be0c75/0_190_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ab5abdf245704a926af21c6560b436","title":"theatres that made us liverpool playhouse theatre orange tree richmond birmingham hippodrome","story":"Chloë Moss remembers the joy of shopping for props for Liverpool Playhouse, while Rosie Kay reflects on her love affair with Birmingham HippodromeChloë Moss: Landing work experience at Liverpool Playhouse was like being granted access to a world I didn’t know existed.

The thought of becoming a playwright was still years away but my short time at the Playhouse opened the door to something I’d not considered possible before – a career in theatre.Nick Ahad: In 2012 I had two things: my dream job as Yorkshire Post arts editor and an itch – I wanted to write for, not just about, theatre. My first play, Nor Any Drop, had been produced by Peshkar and Red Ladder in 2011, but I needed a next step. Bradford’s Theatre in the Mill was run at the time by the visionary Iain Bloomfield (now by another one, Richard Warburton). I had a four-hour conversation with Iain about what I wanted to write and why, one November afternoon in 2011. The following June, A Muslamic Love Story, the story of a gay Muslim man, was on stage. We received bomb threats on opening night. Theatre in the Mill is a place that takes risks and encourages artists to do the same. It’s incredibly democratic, open and welcoming – at times it looks like a drop-in centre for theatre artists. Even though it sits within the Bradford University campus, the audience is not primarily students, but those interested in theatre made at the edges, far from the mainstream.Victoria Dyson: Countless theatres are dear to us, but Stratford Circus in east London holds a special place in our hearts. It was the first venue to give our fledgling company a fighting chance over 10 years ago. A programmed performance combined with space to develop a future show undoubtedly kick-started Filskit Theatre. We still remember the giddy “pinch me” moment of seeing our show poster up in their window. This initial investment enabled us to improve our creative practice, build networks and hone our craft. Their continued support has seen them programme seven Filskit family shows, supporting six shows in development, through space, guidance and workshops. Their strong links with the local community and reputation for valuing high quality work for families make them special. We were welcomed into that family with open arms. This is our love letter to say thank you, Stratford Circus. We wouldn’t be here without you.Rosie Kay: I arrived in Birmingham in 2003, with nothing more than a suitcase, and fell in love with Birmingham Hippodrome. It has been my life since, and staged my work from Asylum and The Wild Party to 5 Soldiers and Fantasia. Last year, the Hippodrome commissioned the large-scale show 10 Soldiers, and one incredible moment was seeing 120 volunteer dancers perform to the Last Post on all the foyer levels of the theatre. It was a powerful moment of how the arts can connect across borders.The theatre and studios are a maze – it’s about three buildings joined together. Only those who live and work there know how to get into the Green Room cafe! The main stage is unlike any other its history and character seep up through the boards. And it seems to reinvent itself time and again, always modern, relevant and accepting. I miss everyone at the Hippodrome. I feel like I’ve grown up there and these people are my family.Joanna Vanderham: At high school, the theatre already loomed large in my life. Dundee Rep in particular felt like it was beckoning, the lights in the cement outside the building calling me. Having seen the company perform a range of plays, the actors were already familiar to me from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to Peer Gynt to Doctor Faustus, I was transported. The painted faces and transformations and feathers and hooves and words and sounds and doorways that led to other worlds and living, breathing, sweating, dancing, spitting, feeling human beings! Right there in front of me! I knew I needed to be up there, too. My die was cast. While training at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, I wrote to Dundee Rep member Irene MacDougall, and she replied. She was modest and inspiring. Now, from the other side, I can tell you, treading the boards is just as glorious as I dreamed.James Brining: I worked at the Orange Tree, in Richmond, for only two years, but it was hugely influential. I was 25 when I became community director, having run a small-scale touring company in the south of England. The Orange Tree’s founding artistic director was Sam Walters. Idiosyncratic and hugely passionate about theatre in the round, he spoke with zeal about the purity of the empty space, about the essence of theatre that needed only one actor and someone else watching the actor at the centre of the process. Whether it was in the beautiful purpose-built theatre or the original room above the Orange Tree pub, where shows were performed in daylight with little or no decor, every production was performed in the round. This approach was also applied to the schools tours where the exposure of the actor to that honest audience of young people gave a raw immediacy to the work. It felt democratic and thrilling there was nowhere to hide. I left with the conviction that the real power of theatre lies in human relationships, whether that’s the interaction between actor and audience or the creative process through which great friendships are forged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9cae18939e04107e28cb22dd7512ec89903c4a/0_116_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d82b6a84b015feebd3553e4b5b6d1e2","title":"from family holidays to suburban commutes why a hybrid suv makes sense","story":"SUVs don’t have to be the imposing gas-guzzlers we often think of them as. For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64213eecf0c7d15eb8217111d7d08bae6113f645/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a8ed39ef989983c910c01ec7f8bf9777","title":"democrats joe biden nervously optimistic blue wave","story":"Joe Biden is polling well ahead of Donald Trump, potentially putting more states in play – but complacency has been banishedLess than four months out from the November election, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been consistently polling ahead of Donald Trump.The president’s approval numbers remain underwater, and Democrats believe they can seriously compete in traditionally red states including Texas, as Trump faces sustained criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis linked to it, as well as the ongoing anti-racism protests against police brutality.For Democrats, these are not the only indicators that things are going well. Infighting between the progressive wing of the party and the establishment wing has been relatively minimal, as they come together to focus on Biden’s campaign to push Trump out of the White House.Some top party officials are feeling ambitious, and want to ride another potential “blue wave” to try to win races that are usually out of reach in states like Georgia and Ohio. But there’s a strain of caution running through the Democratic party as well. Things looked great for them for a while in 2016, too, but Republicans ended up with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and the memory of that cataclysmic loss is still fresh.“I mean, we are emotionally and mentally scarred in such a way that we are not going to feel comfortable until a week after Biden is sworn in,” said the Democratic strategist Tom Bowen.In any election cycle, campaign officials use cautious phrases like “we’re not leaving anything to chance” or “campaigning like we’re 10 points down until election day” – and the 2020 presidential race is no different. But coupled with that is an argument that Trump’s case for re-election is not reaching the voters he needs to.The memo went on to tick off the problems with each of Trump’s arguments.On Tuesday, in another sign that Democrats see a rare opening to compete in what are usually Republican strongholds, the Biden campaign began airing a 60-second general election ad in Texas, fueled by a six-figure ad buy. That ad is the first in a $15m multi-state blitz in six battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Meanwhile, the pro-Trump America First Action Super Pac is pouring $23m into Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin but not Michigan – a state that Trump needs to win re-election. Trump himself has been campaigning over the last few months in reliably red states. Private polling for Republicans also shows the president in trouble in what are usually reliably conservative states.All of which suggests Democrats have the upper hand over Republicans. But Democratic state officials and operatives expect polls to tighten and the summer high to end. In multiple interviews, these officials were hopeful but also realistic that the next few months won’t be easy.Democrats often cite 2016, where polls showed Hillary Clinton as the clear favorite to win the presidency. At that time, and again now, some Democrats also felt retaking control of the Senate was possible.“I’m not going to argue that there isn’t some anxiety there, and I think that 2016 put that in our being because we were feeling very secure that we would have a Democratic president, and things changed so rapidly,” said the Kansas Democratic party chairwoman, Vicki Hiatt.Democrats are hoping to win a US Senate seat in Kansas this cycle, which would usually be unheard of. “I think over the past three and a half years we’ve seen some very unpredictable things happen that we would never have expected. I think that is where that anxiety comes from. For me personally, I’m not going to rest until we have this thing done. I’m cautiously optimistic but I’m not taking anything for granted.”From September, Biden and Trump will face each other in three televised debates, something Republican campaign officials hope the president will be able to dominate. Democrats are also expecting some kind of “October surprise” from the Trump campaign and a barrage of warnings about Democratic control of the White House and Congress.“That tightening will happen. It’s natural. So what we need to be doing is building up our reserves now,” said the Maryland Democratic party chairwoman, Yvette Lewis. “So we can’t waste time right now worrying about the what-ifs.”The Tennessee Democratic party chairwoman, Mary Mancini, said that Republicans have not yet thrown their full offensive force against Democratic candidates this cycle.“Now what they could do and what they’re trying to do is fearmonger their way into winning,” Mancini said. “I think the most damaging and frightening thing is we have yet to see the all-out assault from the Republican party in terms of using fear to motivate voters. We’ve seen a little of it but it’s the tip of the iceberg for the Republican party.”The pandemic has also changed the reality of campaigning for office. More voters will be voting by mail rather than in person, potentially delaying the final results on election night. Trump has argued, contrary to established evidence, that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud.“I think my greatest fear is what the Republicans do now and over the next few months to delegitimise the election,” said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio Democrats’ state house campaign arm.Julian Mulvey, a veteran Democratic ad maker, added: “Every Democrat should be worried. Every Democrat should be nervous because it won’t be over till it’s over. But I think everyone is nervously optimistic right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d8c2e5b71081b487018d28e168d6f0c87dfdfc1/0_0_2604_1562/master/2604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64160e688ac9e83d72a839f1e0416fe7","title":"matt hancock rules out mandatory face masks offices health secretary england","story":"Health secretary says new rules for shops in England will not be extended to officesThe UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has categorically ruled out requiring people to wear face masks in offices, as he hit back at accusations that the new rules stipulating they must be used by shoppers in England were mired in confusion.People face fines of up to £100 if they do not wear face coverings in shops under rules that come into effect from 24 July, which are designed to reassure visitors to the high street amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The move, announced by Hancock in the Commons on Tuesday, came after Labour claimed ministers were in a “complete muddle” over the plans, with Michael Gove saying days earlier that face coverings would not be mandatory in shops.Hancock also sought to play down suggestions that his cabinet colleagues Gove and Liz Truss had sown confusion after they were pictured separately on Tuesday leaving a branch of Pret a Manger, with only the latter wearing a face covering.On Wednesday, the  reported face coverings could soon be recommended in all public places including offices and other workplaces, with officials beginning private talks with groups representing major employers.It came after rules including the requirement that face coverings must be worn in enclosed public spaces such as workplaces were announced in the Blackburn with Darwen area to avoid a Leicester-style lockdown.However, referencing the ’s report and asked whether office workers would have to wear masks when they return to work, Hancock told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday: “No, that isn’t going to happen, and the reason is that in offices you tend to spend a lot of time with the same people, and so the way to stop the spread of the virus in offices is to have social distancing, either 2 metres or 1 metre plus mitigations in place.“The same is true in classrooms, by the way, where if you’re in a classroom, if you’re in a space with the same people repeatedly and for long periods of time, whether an office or a classroom, then a mask doesn’t actually protect them.“Where the masks benefits is from you spreading the disease to other people when you have relatively short interactions with lots of different people, which is why it’s right to have this as mandatory on public transport, in shops and in the NHS but not in offices where you’re basically there with the same group of people for long periods of time, or in classrooms where the same applies. So it’s following the scientific advice.”In an interview with Sky News, Hancock added: “We will not be recommending people wear masks in the office.”Asked about the pictures that emerged on Tuesday showing Gove and Truss apparently conveying a confused message with only the latter wearing a mask leaving a Pret a Manger outlet, Hancock added: “This picture was before we had announced the change in the policy. I announced that change in the policy in the House of Commons yesterday.”Asked who would be right in wearing a face mask in that store, Hancock said: “Well, the advice until 24 July, giving businesses time to make sure that they can get their processes in place and make sure that we can implement this smoothly, the advice now is that face coverings are recommended in shops but not mandatory, that’s been the position for some time and we’re tightening that up to say that they are mandatory from the 24 July.”Asked explicitly if from 24 July somebody would have to wear a face mask coming out of Pret, Hancock said: “You do need to wear a face mask in Pret because Pret is a shop … in hospitality, so in a restaurant, there needs to be table service. If there’s table service then it’s not necessary to have a mask but in any shop you do need the mask.“So if you’re going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway, that is a shop, that is Pret operating as a shop. But if you go to your local pub, you can’t go to the pub – in fact, there have been stories of people stopping people going to the bar – you can’t go to the bar, and the reason there is the risk of transmission over the bar and therefore it’s table service and a mask is not needed.”Meanwhile, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to set out the next steps for the lockdown in a press conference on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868e6357cba7478d81767fe14e501467a97a3281/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953c424f82cdd9569fcbdd3aa47b8b40","title":"angela merkel set for central role in talks on eu recovery plan","story":"Germany has foot in both camps as leaders try to agree on rescue package and seven-year budgetWhen Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit as Germany’s chancellor, in 2005, she joined Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and leaders from central and eastern Europe that had joined the bloc only 17 months earlier. Nearly 15 years later, Merkel is the EU’s longest-serving leader and seen as the key to unlocking a deal to help Europe face the worst economic slump forecast in its history.When EU leaders sit down together on Friday and Saturday, it will be their first face-to-face meeting since the pandemic struck. On the table is a €750bn (£680bn) draft recovery plan, as well as a proposed €1.074tn EU budget for the next seven years. Getting a deal on the budget will be fiendishly difficult as the EU attempts to square the circle of more spending on the environment, security and health and the €75bn shortfall caused by Brexit.Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said Merkel would play a crucial role both because she was “so respected for her work” and because Germany was taking a middle position in the recovery plan, giving it a foot in both camps.She said Germany had “a very strong commitment … to really invest heavily in the recovery of the EU,” but demands from northern countries to link funds to economic reform were “something that is very close to the German heart as well”.Optimistic officials are encouraged by the coincidence that Germany took on the EU council’s rotating presidency on 1 July, amid sniping about the performance of the leaders of EU institutions. Charles Michel, the European council president, tasked with brokering a compromise, has been criticised by some for his handling of budget talks. “He is still paralysed by the failure of the European council in February,” said one senior EU diplomat.An EU official responded that Michel had fully prepared for that February summit, but the task had not been easy as some EU leader were unprepared to compromise. “Since then we have had a global pandemic landing on our doorstep and the world has changed completely.”Germany opened the way to a recovery plan with its own political conversion, enshrined in the deal Merkel struck with France’s Emmanuel Macron for a fund based on grants to countries hardest hit by coronavirus. Pierre Sellal, who spent a decade as France’s most senior diplomat in Brussels, said Merkel had crossed two of Germany’s traditional red lines “The first, no deficits, no common borrowing. And secondly, no transformation of the rules underpinning in the single currency, no budgetary transfers.”The Germany presidency could crystallise a consensus, he said. “Now we are at a very particular moment, the stakes are very high.”Germany’s readiness to accept large-scale EU borrowing contrasts with the stance Merkel took during the eurozone debt crisis, when she stood firmly against a transfer union. The German government “realised that its own approach doesn’t allow the necessary convergence and cohesion in the EU,” said Schwarzer, who highlighted the role of Germany’s Social Democrat finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as architect of the policy shift. Schwarzer said Germany’s change of heart was “not out of some kind of abstract idea of solidarity – but it’s really in Germany’s self-interest to do so.”Since Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US – two hammer blows to the European project – all EU leaders have become more aware of their economic interdependence and the risks of the European single market unravelling. “Thanks to Brexit … suddenly the leaders say we will defend the single market,” said a second senior EU diplomat, who also cited Trump and tensions in the EU-China relationship. As political frost descends on global trade, what was once seen as Germany’s strength, its export-led economy, suddenly looked more like a vulnerability.Merkel’s change of heart has weakened the “frugal four”, a quartet of northern European states that want less EU spending and more budget discipline. For months, Germany had been perceived as an unofficial member. Now they stand more isolated.But EU officials caution that Germany’s policy shift is not enough for agreement, as the frugal four continue to insist on tough conditions for loans that southern European governments reject as unacceptable. “Even having the Franco-German proposal is not always helpful, said one official. “We are playing chess on many different levels.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, shop steward of the frugal four, said on Tuesday he was “not hopeful” of a deal.The other big obstacle comes from the leader second only to Merkel in years running his country: Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister is resisting plans to tie the disbursement of EU funds to the rule of law, a key demand for western European governments alarmed about the weakening of democratic checks and balances in Hungary. Orbán got a symbolic boost from lawmakers in his Fidesz party this week who passed a resolution declaring that EU funds should not be linked to “political or ideological conditions – under the label of rule of law”.Solving this political Rubik’s cube is now bound up with the political legacy of the German chancellor, who told MEPs this month: “The top priority in the Germany presidency will be unity in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097a85a66960898b0a6617e622572a8d8f785ac3/7_0_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b31f7761bd9b3c4030e7c5dc5e2d852","title":"bild zeitung tabloid julian reichelt angela merkel germany","story":"The newspaper Bild has long poured vitriol on the country’s left-wingers and ‘do gooders’. But now it has a new target: the chancellor. By  Thomas Meaney‘It would be ideal if you could hit a deer,” Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Europe’s largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung, told his chauffeur. “ readers could do with a bit more colour.” We had reached escape velocity out of ice-encrusted Düsseldorf. The Mercedes S-Class locked into place like a bobsled on the Autobahn. I sat shotgun with Reichelt’s assortment of sports gear, a hockey stick between my legs. “We are lucky in our driver today,” Reichelt said, deadpan. “Last time we hit a wild boar and the boar and the car went flying.”I was travelling with Reichelt on one of his publicity tours across Germany. For the past two years, he has made an appointment once a month to commune with groups of Bild’s 1.3 million readers. “You have to feel their emotions,” he told me from the backseat. “You have to listen to their hearts.”Reichelt, who is 40, made his name as a war reporter in Syria, but today confines most of his battle courage to Twitter, where he enjoys needling the German political establishment and barging into leftwing echo chambers. In person, Reichelt exudes a twitchy exuberance, like a fighter pilot who has managed to smuggle champagne into the cockpit. His eyes restlessly gauge the world around him, clocking who he needs to avoid and who he needs to attract. Into his phone, he volleys directives to subeditors, assistants and the band of young male disciples he sends around the world to collect stories. “The leading populist in western Germany,” is how Albrecht von Lucke, editor of the prestigious left-liberal monthly Blätter, describes him.For decades, Bild was an object of scorn for any self-respecting West German of social democratic orientation. In a political culture more conformist and decorous than most of its western peers, Bild functioned like the Las Vegas strip, concentrating all of the Federal Republic’s seediness in one place. Seven days a week, Bild pumped free-market mantras, alongside ads for car tyres and chicken wings, into the stiff arteries of cold war West Germany. Bild decried long hair on men and the marriage of its top models to foreigners. It genuflected before South African apartheid, Greek dictatorship, Bavarian sedans and American Pershing missiles. Above all, Bild dedicated itself to the destruction of communist East Germany, and fought a long battle against what it viewed as enemy collaborators in the leftist student movement at home.Such was the stature of Bild in West Germany that in 1965, after the daily rose in price from 10 to 15 pfennigs, Axel Springer, who referred to Bild as his “dog on a chain”, proposed to Chancellor Ludwig Erhard that the state introduce a special 15 pfennig coin to make it easier to purchase the paper. Meanwhile, the East German Stasi was so impressed by Bild as a state propaganda tool that it crafted its own – imaginatively titled – NEUE Bild Zeitung, which was sold at the border with West Germany, where it conspicuously failed to wean class enemies off the original.Today Bild is paradoxically less influential than it was in the 60s, but more politically important. “I read it first in the morning because it is the agenda-setter,” says Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of the liberal weekly, Die Zeit. “Politicos in Berlin probably read it first in the morning as well.” The paper enjoys a close relationship with the German political elite. The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was one of the best men at the wedding of former Bild editor, Kai Diekmann, and in 2008, Diekmann performed the same role for Kohl at his wedding. “Kohl rules with Bild,” the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll wrote, and Kohl’s successor as chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, affirmed the practice: “To govern I need Bild, Bild Sunday’s edition, and the telly,” he once said.Bild’s intimate relationship with some of Germany’s most powerful figures is a vestige of its days as the country’s decisive reputation maker-and-breaker. The former defence minister, now the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has shown up at one of Reichelt’s dinner parties at the Bild offices in Berlin, and for the past few years Bild has hosted part of the annual Munich Security Conference, the equivalent of Davos for the global defence industry. Although Angela Merkel has not ingratiated herself with the Springer complex — despite receiving early political support from Bild — her husband is nevertheless paid €10,000 a year to grace the board of the nonprofit Friede Springer Foundation, named after Axel Springer’s widow.Despite its traditional proximity to power, Bild has mutated into something beyond a stalwart defender of the German status quo. Now, says Joffe, it is “an equal-opportunity anti-establishment force”. “Previous Bild editors made their alliances more based on personal feeling,” says the journalist Stefan Niggemeier, who in 2004 co-founded the BILDBlog, a website that corrects Bild’s factual errors and misrepresentations. “But Reichelt is different. He is an actually political person.”Reichelt’s agenda is marked less by novelty than by a chest-crunching resuscitation of Bild’s core commitments: pro-US, pro-Nato, pro-Israel, pro-austerity, pro-capital, anti-Russia, anti-China. According to the Bild worldview, the best way to counter the left is to portray its demands as totalitarian, and the best way to kill off the far right is to cannibalise its grievances. While Bild prints relatively little material that a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would object to, Reichelt sees the party as a threat to his effort to remake the German political scene. “We want nothing to do with the imbeciles of the AfD,” he told me. “The way to destroy them is to make room for their voters in what used to be the political mainstream of this country.”Bild’s main attack targets remain Germany’s “Gutmenschen” – the do-gooders, vegetarians, Greens and 1968ers who are treated as parasites and irritants to Germany’s robust economy and middle class. More recently, the paper’s sights have also turned on Merkel and her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “The paper’s constant targeting of Merkel, but also its current take on refugees and all sorts of minorities definitely reproduces rhetorical elements of the AfD,” says Fatma Aydemir, a novelist and columnist for the leftwing daily Tageszeitung, known as Taz. In the absence of serious challenges from within Merkel’s own party, or from other parties – she has been chancellor for 14 years, a tenure surpassed only by Kohl and Bismarck – Bild has attempted to make itself into that opposition. Yet any populist challenger finds itself in the hard position of convincing Germans that Merkel’s very successful form of reactive politics has run out of historical steam. “We are the voice of ordinary people,” claims Reichelt. “If we didn’t exist, they would really think the whole system is against them.”We pulled into the fire station in the proud town of Sprockhövel, about 18 miles north-east of Düsseldorf, where a few dozen people greeted us, most of them in firefighter gear. Bild beer steins, Bild lighters and other Bild paraphernalia had been laid out on the firefighters’ bar. Reichelt marched out to the garage with the fire engines, where a small table stood. He took a sip of beer, and addressed the group with aplomb.“It’s an honour to be among you because, as you know, I like to meet our readers face to face,” Reichelt said. He wanted to know why they had become firefighters. “It’s that feeling that we’re brothers,” said one of the younger firefighters. “That we have each other’s back. You don’t get that feeling elsewhere.” Yes, Reichelt agreed, courage was in short supply in Germany. Courage: that was a virtue Bild could get behind.“The only trouble we have with Bild,” said another, old fireman, “is your picture contest!”Reichelt made a show of pricking up his ears. “Oh really? Is there something we’re doing wrong? I welcome your criticism!”“It encourages people to send in the most sensational photos possible, but people block the way to fires because they’re trying to take photos for Bild!”Reichelt’s face registered the gravity of the charge. He moved like a matador, coaxing anyone else with negative things to say to hurl them at his face. “Look, that’s terrible, and we’ll have to stop that. I’ll get on that immediately,” he told the man who complained about the photo contest.After Reichelt had presided over dinner in the firefighters’ hall, we got back into the Mercedes and sped into the dark. I asked him why he goes out of his way for pow-wows with his readership. “Bild is the last national campfire experience in German life,” he told me. “It’s the last thing that Germans can come together for.” It was a curious way of viewing a newspaper that has, for decades, polarised a country otherwise committed to “consensus politics” into two camps: Bild readers and Bild haters. Yet Reichelt delivered this well-greased lump of Springer-speak with what seemed like sincerity.The experience of reading Bild is a sugar-rush of gossip, accompanied by the clanging gong of headlines. As is traditional, scandals are designated for the front page, but in Bild’s current iteration, fear-mongering appears to be privileged over celebrity soup: “Germany’s most dangerous gang leader is free again” reads a typical headline. Alongside the main stories, the front page also lists the dollar exchange rate and the price of gold, as well as the “winners” and “losers” of the day. A loser might be Prince Charles, whose charity, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, may have received dark money from Russians. (“Bild says: black money for blue blood!”) Or a loser might be Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, claiming that there is a “large, coordinated campaign” by the German government to fund misinformation in Russia: “Bild says: what nonsense!” Winners tend to be businessmen making big deals or celebrities being nice to children.The most reliably absurdist section of Bild typically falls on page 3 or 4, with a report from Paul Ronzheimer, Reichelt’s star protege. There one finds Ronzheimer posing in front of a Brazilian forest fire Ronzheimer posing in front of the Venezuelan opposition leader Ronzheimer posing in front of a Hong Kong street fight Ronzheimer posing in front of Syrian refugees Ronzheimer disbursing fake Drachmas to poor Greeks encouraging them to leave Europe. His stories appear as little frames of text under giant, hard-won selfies, as if to declare: Bild was here! “Ronzheimer does have a discernible function,” says von Lucke. “He makes Bild readers feel like they’re reading a paper that has incredible access, that Bild has a global presence.”As editor, Reichelt sees himself less as a news impresario than as an emotional entrepreneur. “Journalism is basically about emotions, as all of the other news outlets in this country seem to have forgotten,” he told me. Reichelt likes to point out what he sees as the shared delusions of the more “respectable” German press. “Take Merkel,” he said. “Here you have this completely mediocre mind, and the press has created this elaborate mythology around her. That she’s some sort of savage wit in private – which is not true, by the way – and that she’s fantastically clever – which is not true either. She’s just capable of identifying the direction of prevailing winds.”For Reichelt, Merkel represents the depoliticisation of German society, a process that has obscured the faultlines between conservatives and liberals. For almost two decades, at a series of decisive moments, Merkel has deftly stolen her antagonists’ platforms out from under them. In 2003, she phased in a neoliberal agenda in the CDU, but when it nearly backfired at the polls two years later, she started to introduce programmes from the Social Democrats. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Merkel became anti-nuclear overnight. Merkel’s response to the 1 million migrants entering Germany in the summer of 2015 has been widely interpreted as an instance of principle over pragmatism – a chancellor seizing the chance to make amends for her nation’s past – but even then, Merkel had carefully weighed German public opinion, and promptly ramped up anti-refugee legislation once the middle class’s pro-refugee enthusiasm had subsided. The leftwing sociologist Wolfgang Streeck once described Merkel as “a postmodern politician with a premodern, Machiavellian contempt for both causes and people”.This shape-shifting has made German politics a much more difficult game to play, and Reichelt sees it as his job to restore the old pre-Merkel isions. To this end, he has made Bild into a loudspeaker for some of the chancellor’s fiercest critics. In early September 2018, in the wake of violent far-right demonstrations in the Saxon city of Chemnitz, Reichelt met with Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of German intelligence, and offered him the the pulpit of Bild when Maassen wanted to contradict Merkel’s account of anti-migrant “hunts” that had allegedly taken place in Chemnitz. Maassen’s attempt to cast doubt on the chancellor’s version of events got him removed from his post, but it transformed him into one of the most vocal martyrs of the German right.Since his earliest teenage years, Reichelt dreamed of becoming the editor of Bild Zeitung. I asked him how someone like himself, born in Hamburg in 1980 – when Bild was still considered radioactive by most teachers and students across Germany – could have concocted such an ambition. “I was born into a family of journalists,” Reichelt told me. “In our household, Axel Springer was a hero, and Heinrich Böll was an enemy.” Reichelt, who perfected his English abroad at Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, looked up to young Bild reporters as bourgeois paladins pitted against the leftwing rabble of 1980s Hamburg, a city teeming with wealth, but also one of the hubs of the country’s anarchist left.It is hard to think of an institution more tightly bound up with the history of the Federal Republic than Bild Zeitung. The first introduction that some young Germans get to the paper today is Günter Wallraff’s withering exposé, Der Aufmacher (The Leader-writer), which continues to be taught in a few secondary schools four decades after its publication. In 1977, Wallraff went undercover in order to try to expose Bild as a giant fabrication mill. Instead he discovered an underworld of cynical publicists intent on becoming cheerleaders of the postwar German economic boom. In one scene, which describes a regular day at the Bild office, one of the Bild reporters listens to a distressed caller who has called into a fake suicide-prevention hotline that Bild has set up, and whispers to Wallraff: “He’s about to jump off the balcony any minute, he’s nearly there!”I visited Wallraff last year in his light-filled studio in the Ehrenfeld neighbourhood of Cologne. His office is full of African art, and the books of his heroes, such as Upton Sinclair. “In the 1970s and 80s, Bild was in total control of the media, and there was very little being done about it,” Wallraff told me, over a game of ping-pong in his workshop. “If you were their enemy, they made you into a terrorist.”We retreated back into Wallraff’s studio, where he had the latest copy of Bild. The headline was about Boris Johnson’s hair: “This mop now rules Britain”. “I haven’t flipped through it in a while,” Wallraff told me. “But I can see it’s taken a more civilised tone. You should have seen it in the 1970s: all of the articles in support of the dictatorship in Greece and Chile, the articles in favour of apartheid.”Wallraff remains a heroic figure for many Germans who remember Bild as an enemy of the student protesters of 1968 – whom the newspaper referred to as “rioters”, “a radical danger”, and “left-academic fascists”. One of Springer’s main targets was the Marxist thinker and activist Rudi Dutschke, who was shot in 1968 in Berlin by a rightwing fanatic inspired by the murderer of Martin Luther King Jr. A few days before the attack, Bild had referred to Dutschke as “State Enemy #1”, and it had previously run headlines such as “Stop Dutschke now!” After the shooting, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Berlin, chanting, “Bild shot as well!”. Dutschke suffered brain damage from the attack, and died years later as a result of his injuries.“West Germany in the 1960s was a completely authoritarian state,” said Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz – Dutschke’s widow, and an author of several books about 1968 – when we met in Berlin earlier this year. “Bild was the symbol of that.” Dutschke-Klotz agrees with Wallraff that Bild is a milder publication today, and that the 1968ers triumphed over it. “Society was full of old Nazis then,” she said. “It was full of people who, outside of the Weimar Republic, had barely lived in a democracy. Bild has been beaten in the cultural sphere, especially if you consider the place of women in society now, or climate politics.”But in the 60s there were others who took a different view: that what they were witnessing was the irreversible Springerisation of society. Heinrich Böll devoted not one, but three books, including one of his literary masterpieces – The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum – to denouncing Bild, which he credited not only with poisoning public life, but also with wrecking the German language itself with “primitive bon-mot-ism”. Bild, wrote Böll in 1972, was “no longer crypto-fascistic, no longer fascisoid, but naked fascism: incitement, lies, garbage”.The most visible element of West Germany’s hard left, the Red Army Faction, and its leading voice, Ulrike Meinhof, took Böll’s criticism a considerable step further. In May 1972, after calling for the expropriation of Springer, and holding public hearings against the company, the Red Army Faction bombed the Axel Springer offices in Hamburg, injuring at least 17 people. Meinhof declared the attacks were in the name of Springer’s victims: communists, Palestinians, foreign workers. “Who else were they going to attack?” Dutschke-Klotz told me. “The mayor of Berlin? He had already apologised for attacking student protesters. Bild was the obvious target.”That was almost 50 years ago. After the cold war, Bild became a celebrity rag, which former adversaries could dismiss as a more innocuous symptom of a depoliticised culture than an ideological lodestar in its own right. Kai Diekmann, who edited the paper from 2001 to 2015, neatly exhibited the contradictions of German conservatism in the Merkel era. A faithful page of Helmut Kohl, he wanted to maintain Germany’s position as the prime European reaper of globalisation – the country’s export model depends on taking advantage of a currency weakened by its fellow Eurozone members – but also attacked expressions of globalisation within Germany’s borders.In his 2007 screed, The Great Self-Deception, Diekmann railed against the usual suspects of the German right: Muslims, “multi-kulti” liberals and environmentalists. Diekmann’s idea was that the leftwards shuffle of the political consensus – exemplified in Merkel’s long-standing coalition with the Social Democrats – needed to be beaten back by an elite-led populist movement that would restore German conservatives to their former glory. The dream was to bring back good old-fashioned German values, but keep the settings of German economic dominance in place. As the political face of this movement, Diekmann favoured Merkel’s defence minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose impeccably aristocratic credentials and Ted-talk persona would make him the ideal patrician-tribune of Germany’s silent majority. But the dream collapsed in 2011, when Guttenberg fell into disgrace after it was discovered he had plagiarised his doctoral dissertation. Today, the man who was once due to make German conservatism great again runs an investment firm in Manhattan, and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut.Reichelt took over Bild in 2018, after his immediate predecessor, Tanit Koch, who tried to steer the paper in a more anodyne, Merkel-friendly direction, left the position. (Koch has spoken of her exit in cool terms, telling a German news website that she felt she did not have the support of the Axel Springer CEO.) Under Reichelt’s tenure, the paper quickly established itself as a battering ram against Merkel. Bild once again plays the game of guiding and reflecting public opinion on a host of questions. Among its enthusiasms are German cars and the arms industry. “At last! The Leopard-2 tank in Idlib and possibly soon in the fight against Assad’s Russian tanks (T-55, T-62, T-72 and T-90),” tweeted Bild’s political editor about recent events in Syria. “As always, it takes a Turk to use a German tank for what it was built for.”There are a few non-populist positions Reichelt takes that have the appearance of principle. “He has staked out anti-Putin, pro-Nato, pro-Israel positions well beyond the standard German line,” says Niggemeier. But the majority of the paper’s content is an ever-shifting attempt to harness popular discontent rather than indoctrinate readers in any specific programme. Reichelt himself has, for instance, repeatedly come to Merkel’s defence on her decision not to close the border to Syrian refugees in 2015, describing it as an ethical “no-brainer”, but the paper goes to great lengths to associate migrants with crime, and to demand deportations. On the environment, one day Bild might be lamenting Merkel’s call to shutter coal factories by 2038 (“The coal deadline is going to cost us!” ran a headline about the prospective job losses.) But another day you might read that “Our government officials are destroying the environment!” atop an article detailing the 200,000 yearly flights German officials take between ministries in Berlin and Bonn. Like Merkel herself, Reichelt is an arch-opportunist, congenitally averse to letting crises go to waste.Several German journalists I spoke to attributed Reichelt’s heightened focus on Bild’s politics to a desperate attempt to counteract falling readership numbers. One of Reichelt’s heroes, he told me, is Franz-Josef Strauss, a legendary conservative postwar politician, who was famous for his political mantra: “Never allow a party right of the Christian Social Union”. Bild’s competitors on its right today come from Breitbart-esque news blogs such as Politically Incorrect. Bild seems to have done its best to outflank these outlets by covering the same kinds of stories as them, often in much the same tone. In more than one case, these articles have been false. In 2017, the paper ran a story about a mob of Arab men assaulting women in a Frankfurt restaurant, which police subsequently confirmed never happened. On the international front, Bild echoes the calls of prominent German centrist liberals who believe Germany must assume a leading role in world affairs. “You have this ongoing performance whereby they call for Germany to be in the middle of the action, but have no sense of responsibility for what that would entail,” says Blätter editor Albrecht von Lucke. “As soon as you have German troops deployed anywhere, even on the most humanitarian mission imaginable, who will be the first to cry out about it when the first guys fall in the war? Who will demand they come home and that it’s all been a mistake? Bild. You can count on that.” It is the same mentality that led one Bavarian AfD politician earlier this year to tweet against the banning of a beer festival because of Covid-19 – only to go on to sue the city of Rosenheim for the rise in cases after the beer festival did take place.The coronavirus pandemic initially caught Bild – and the German right – off guard. After the government’s strong response to the crisis, Merkel seemed immune to criticism. Bild turned its focus to China. In April, Reichelt published a public letter demanding €149bn in reparations from Beijing for the economic impact of Covid-19. “You shut down every newspaper and website that is critical of your rule,” Reichelt wrote in the letter, “but not the stalls where bat soup is sold.” The stunt made headlines around the world, and predictably enraged the Chinese embassy in Berlin. (A more expansive version of Bild’s letter by Springer’s CEO, calling for the decoupling of western economies from China, appeared in Springer’s respectable daily, Die Welt.) It’s this willingness to play fast and loose with geopolitics, now in a populist vein, that makes Bild, according to von Lucke, “much more dangerous than it ever was before”. (Not that Bild neglected the domestic front. “Despite corona restrictions, 300 people gather at mosque for prayer”, read one headline in April. “Churches closed for fear of Ramadan-chaos,” ran another.)When public impatience with closed schools and shops began to mount in late May, Bild, having failed to gain traction with its usual scapegoats, changed tack. Its new target was Germany’s leading virologist, Christian Drosten, who had become an unexpected celebrity thanks to his measured media interviews and his advisory role to Merkel’s government. On 25 May, one of Bild’s reporters sent him an email, claiming that other experts had serious criticisms of his latest study on Covid-19. The reporter demanded that Drosten respond within an hour. Instead, Drosten published the email on Twitter and said there that he had “better things to do”. The subsequent article, which tried to blow up minor statistical disagreements into a public assault on Drosten’s reputation, backfired drastically. The German mediasphere rallied to his defense: #Ichhabebessereszutun (#betterthingstodo) became a hashtag. Georg Streiter, a former deputy government spokesperson who also used to work at Bild and still praises the paper, called it a baseless smear campaign, and put the blame squarely on Reichelt. “It’s like dog owners,” he said. “The problem is usually at the top of the leash.”“We’re read by more German professors than any other publication,” Reichelt told me when I visited his office in the Axel Springer building in Berlin last year. “We’re read by the businessmen and the workers – and if some read us for ironic reasons, well, that’s fine, too.”The Springer building is a giant glass structure that towers over nearby restaurants and embassies. (A new Springer building, designed by Rem Koolhaas, which resembles a damaged glass cube, has been recently erected across the road.) Outside is a statue of a vaguely leprous-looking Axel Springer. A few streets over, extending more than five storeys up the side of the headquarters of Taz, the leftwing daily, stands another piece of Bild lore: a giant high-relief sculpture of Kai Diekmann’s penis. This ostentatious invasion of the former Bild editor’s privacy, unveiled in 2009, sprouted out of a long conflict that had begun seven years earlier, when Diekmann sued Taz for publishing a satirical article claiming he had undergone penis enhancement surgery in Miami. (At the time the judge ruled that, as the nation’s leading purveyor and profiteer of gossip, Diekmann must learn to live with this jab at this dignity.)With its smartly dressed assistants and ample supply of alcohol, Bild’s headquarters in Berlin succeeds in transmitting a throwback aura. “In case there’s any doubt that I’m a real tabloid editor,” Reichelt said, flashing me his lighter with a naked woman on it, as he lit up a Gauloises Blue in his office. The room was strewn with Americana: a Kennedy photograph, a Reagan biography. On top of a pile of books lay a child’s car seat, next to a contemporary military-grade helmet that Reichelt wore when he covered the Syrian war for Springer. On the floor was a copy of the Financial Times. (“It repays the attention you give it every morning,” he told me. “It’s such a great product.”) I asked him why, in the past couple of years, Bild has reduced the number of naked women in the paper. “It wasn’t for any politically correct reason,” said Reichelt. “It’s just that when so much of your staff is female, and they’re all very professional, it just gets slightly awkward having to rank naked women with them day in and day out.”For the daily editorial meeting, we entered a conference room, where about 12 staffers were seated around a long table, overlooking the Berlin skyline. “What have we got?” Reichelt asked. An image of Ursula von der Leyen was displayed on a big screen. “Can we give her a bit more brightness in her face?” asked one of the women at the table. “She looks a bit lugubrious.” “There we go, there we go – more gravitas now,” said another woman.“What’s going on in that?” Reichelt said, looking at a photo of a musician wearing lederhosen and a high-and-tight haircut. Reichelt was munching on chocolate now. I had been told that Bild editorial meetings could be rough going, but this one was running smoothly.“That’s the folk singer Andreas Gabalier,” said another man at the table. “He going to be awarded the Karl Valentin prize in Munich, but apparently he’s some kind of rightwing hardliner.”“What’s he doing in the photo?” Reichelt asked.“Apparently he’s contorted his body into the form of a swastika,” the man replied.“I don’t quite see it,” Reichelt said.“Couldn’t it just be a walk-like-an-Egyptian dance move there?”“Yes, it’s all a bit unclear.”“All right, we’ll just say that some people interpret it as a swastika.”“Anything on the crime front?” Reichelt asked.“We’ve got a paedophile paediatrician who sexually abused young boys for 15 years.”“What was the ruling on this guy?” Reichelt asked.“Judge has put him away for ever.”“Nice. Great judge. Can I see a photo of him?” A photo of a grey-haired man named Roland Christiani flashed up on the screen. “What a great face! He looks like a professor,” Reichelt said. “Let’s give him a bump in the headline.”“How about ‘Judge locks paediatrician away for ever’?”“I like it!” said Reichelt.“Can I get a show of hands of how many of you are for the proposed speed limit?” Reichelt asked his lieutenants. Merkel’s government was threatening to impose a speed limit on German cars. A few hands went up. “God, it’s just like the country at large – we’re completely ided on this,” Reichelt said. “Why are you against it?” He trained his eyes on an editor.“People just drive too fast. I’m tired of being scared on the autobahn when a car comes by doing 200kmh.”“The trouble is that if you lower the speed limit I can’t make it to Hamburg in two hours any more,” another editor said.“You drive to Hamburg in two hours? That’s insane: maybe there should be a limit,” Reichelt joked.The trouble with the speed limit, Reichelt later told me in private, was that it interfered with the fundamental German ideal of freedom, which is that, within the rules, you can do what you want. “There are too many Germans now waking up to find that if they eat meat and love their car, they’re suddenly Nazis,” Reichelt said. “And that’s exactly how the German left speaks. They speak of their fellow citizens as criminals, as people committing crimes against future generations, and they even want to see if they can perhaps introduce punishments – to formally make this into a crime. But what about all those people who aren’t waiting for the delivery of their new Tesla?” Next year will almost certainly be Merkel’s last as chancellor. She has already relinquished her position as the secretary of the CDU. When it came to the struggle to determine her successor last year – specifically, who would fill the role of secretary – Reichelt personally favoured the millionaire businessman Friedrich Merz over Merkel’s chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. But Reichelt hastened to point out that his favourites don’t get special treatment in Bild. “Did I want Merz to replace Merkel? Probably. Did we hesitate to destroy him? No. Bild ran the interview that fatally damaged his campaign when he claimed he was a millionaire but still middle-class. The power to destroy is Bild’s most valuable weapon, and I would not sacrifice it for anything – not even my own political preferences.” It was a nice line, but Reichelt’s resort to journalistic principle seemed a convenient way to gloss an interview that had, quite unexpectedly, taken on a life of its own.With Merkel’s departure on the horizon, the fight is already brewing at the political centre, as German regional leaders try to outbid each other with the comprehensiveness of their coronavirus crackdowns in a headlong appeal to the aged voters who still determine German politics. In the face of this political future, Reichelt is sanguine. “Trump has shown that anything can happen – that’s just a fact,” he told me. “There is no reason that the future has to be dictated by Green parties and child protesters.”But there seems little chance that Bild will be able to retrieve any viable vintage of German conservative leadership from the cellar. “We have to hope that the radicalisation of Bild, like the rise of autocrats around the world, represents the last gasp of patriarchal thinking,” says Tania Martini, a media critic for Taz. As Bild’s sputtering failure to derail Merkel and her scientists during the pandemic showed, the German public is largely unwilling at present to erge from what it takes to be the steady course. Threats to Bild’s position as Merkel’s leading critic are closer to home: the most scathing recent critique of Merkel’s government has come from outside any established political platform, in the form of a blue-haired, 27-year-old internet influencer who castigated the German political establishment for its record on climate change, welfare, and migration in a 55-minute, copiously annotated YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 17m times.The last time I saw Reichelt in his office, last summer, he wanted to talk about his preferred enemies. “There is Putin,” he told me. “He wants to weaken our German institutions and interfere with our elections. You know why? Because he knows he lives in a piece of shit country – that he has made his country into shit – and so he wants other countries to come down to his level so that his disastrous record can be less easily seen.”Before he could get any further in his diatribe, a Bild reporter lunged into the office. “Piëch is dead,” he announced. The family owner of Porsche, Ferdinand Piëch, had apparently died.“In a pizzeria,” said the reporter. “It seems it was a heart attack.”“Can we get confirmation?” He suggested giving Gerhard Schröder a call.“Sure, we’ll get confirmation.”Piëch had not died in a pizzeria after all, we learned a few moments later, somewhat to Reichelt’s annoyance. But then he quickly picked back up the thread. “Then we have the spineless left at home, that just wants to let Putin and Assad run roughshod over the whole liberal western order. They want to bring the German car industry to a screeching halt, freeze rents in Berlin, starve the economy and keep Germany from doing anything in the world. I remember meeting with some people here in the defence ministry when I got back from covering the war in Syria. Let’s build a no-fly zone in northern Syria, I said. Let’s go do it alone if we have to. But no one in Germany with power knows how to use it – or even wants to use it.”“What about Bild?” I asked.“With Bild,” Reichelt smiled, “it’s the other way around.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c79106f1b268eba9afffd3035c1dfbf29eca92/0_69_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8ea96a24a6ba9e6e2294c85aee9f4d7","title":"black lives matter sculpture of jen reid removed colston  bristol","story":"The sculpture of protester has been taken to a museum for artist Marc Quinn to collect, says Bristol city councilThe sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester that replaced a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol has been removed just 24 hours after it went up.Contractors were pictured using ropes and a crane to secure the statue of Jen Reid, who had been photographed standing on the plinth with a raised fist on the day the figure of Colston was removed, at about 5.20am on Thursday morning.A witness said that the workmen carefully secured the strap before moving the Marc Quinn sculpture, with one saying “don’t break her dress”. It was then lifted into a recycling and skip hire lorry and driven away.A Bristol city council spokeswoman said: “This morning we removed the sculpture. It will be held at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection.”BBC Bristol reported that Quinn would be charged with the cost of the removal and that the council said it had received complaints of fly-tipping.Reid and Quinn have said that any proceeds from the sale of the work will go to two charities chosen by Reid that are devoted to improving the teaching of black history in British schools.The black resin and steel statue, entitled A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, was put up without the council’s knowledge shortly before 5am on Wednesday by a team under the direction of Quinn. He had said it was not intended to be in place permanently.Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the city was going through an “incredibly delicate time”.“This is not about taking down a statue of Jen, who is a very impressive woman,” Rees said.“This is about taking down a statue of a London-based artist who came and put it up without permission.”Rees said when he spoke to Quinn, the artist was unaware that after the toppling of the Colston statue the grave of Scipio Africanus - a memorial to an enslaved African man – had been vandalised. A message left in chalk near the site read: “Put Colston’s statue back or things will really heat up.”“If you’re going to do something, you need to do it with awareness and a full knowledge of the context in which you’re doing it,” Rees said.The statue of Colston had stood for more than a century, prompting some social media users to say that the council should have allowed the statue of Reid to remain in place for longer before bringing it down.Tim Burns, a charity worker, said: “Some days I wake up a feel proud to live in Bristol. Other days I feel like we missed the point? The Jen Reid statue didn’t need to be permanent but after procrastinating for years over whether to take down Colston removing this after 24 hours feels unnecessary.”The author Bernardine Evaristo tweeted: “Now it has to find a public spot. If Bristol doesn’t have the guts, I nominate Brixton.”Police said on Thursday that no offence had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. Most passersby in Bristol appeared to approve of the addition to the plinth, with many taking selfies raising a fist in front of it.There was some tension last night when a group arrived to say the statue should come down, prompting others on the scene to take a knee.Before the statue came down, Reid and Quinn both said that they viewed its future as being a matter for others to decide. “Whether it’s there for a day or a week or a month, it’s been there,” Reid said.Quinn said that “once you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more”.• This article was amended on 16 July 2020 to correct a statement about damage to the grave of Scipio Africanus and to correct a misspelling of Bernardine Evaristo’s first name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fde270d2974279aa347d8d27f3cc0e62ded6d/73_138_872_523/master/872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b666b2b45dc051c9ed3ad4e85ff5b09","title":"dutch city ends ties with polish twin declared gay free zone nieuwegein pulawy","story":"Nieuwegein council votes to end links to Puławy, which has vowed to discourage tolerance A Dutch city has severed its longstanding ties with its twin in Poland after the Polish municipality established itself as an official “gay-free zone”.The city council of Nieuwegein, south of Utrecht, voted almost unanimously to end its friendship with Puławy in eastern Poland.The municipality 80 miles from Warsaw is one of 100 that have vowed to discourage tolerance and avoid providing financial assistance to NGOs working to promote equal rights.“LGBT-free zones”, backed by resolutions voted on by local councillors, are said by equality campaigners to cover about a third of Poland.Following the decision by councillors in Nieuwegein to vote by 26-1 to terminate the relationship, stickers with a rainbow flag were placed on one of the city’s entrance signs to cover up its Polish counterpart’s name.“Setting the gay-free zones is a serious business and our council has issued a very clear statement that this is not acceptable,” said the Dutch city’s alderman, Marieke Schouten. “We are a rainbow city. And we are both part of Europe, in which we believe that whoever you are, regardless of your orientation, you can be there in public space. It does not include a gay-free zone.”The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, who secured a new term last weekend, vowed during his election campaign to “defend children from LGBT ideology”. The pledge proved popular among his conservative base and the Catholic church.In a survey conducted last year, when asked to name the biggest threat to Poland the most popular answer among men under 40 was “the LGBT movement and gender ideology”.Duda, who is allied with the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) , also vowed to oppose gay marriage or adoption by gay couples, which he described as part of “a foreign ideology”.The mayor of Nieuwegein, Frans Backhuijs, had expressed his concerns about developments in a letter to Puławy in March but did not receive a response.Bożena Krygier, the president of Puławy city council, told the Dutch broadcaster RTL Nederland: “Poland is Poland with its own identity, its own history and its own ideas. This is why we believe that partner municipalities should not interfere with our resolutions.”Relations between the two cities had already been in the deep freeze since 2015 after more than 21 years of official twinning.The motion backed by the councillors this week formally proposed to “unfriend” the two municipalities and terminate all contacts.“We therefore hope that the people concerned, who belong to the LGBTI community in Poland, feel supported by us,” Schouten said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165f7aa213b1edf42a42074b8b21cc573a5771fa/0_101_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1509fbecdf1a7f62e6c08f3b0fa560d2","title":"moderna coronavirus vaccine trials","story":"Promising details were released this week about Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine but it remains in the early stages of developmentHopeful news about a Covid-19 vaccine developed by US government researchers and Moderna Inc has buoyed expectations – and markets – on the potential for a preventive measure against a global pandemic that has killed more than half a million people and upended daily life.Moderna first announced its vaccine, backed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, prompted an immune response in 45 adults in May.On Tuesday, it published a fuller look at the data in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.But experts cautioned against heightened expectations about the Moderna vaccine, one of many being worked on around the world, as it is still in the early stages of development.“These are small studies,” Hotez added. “This is why you have to do the big phase 3 clinical trials in 10,000 to 30,000 patients,” he said.The news comes as cases surge across America’s Sun Belt, a region ning southern California to Florida, and researchers not involved in the research noted challenges lay ahead.Florida has crossed an ominous threshold with more than 300,000 Covid-19 cases. Republican Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt announced he had tested positive for Covid-19, the first known case in a US governor. And America’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci issued a pointed call for the White House to stop the “nonsense”, referring to criticism of his efforts, in an interview with the Atlantic.More than 150 laboratories worldwide are working to develop vaccines for Covid-19, most in early phases. Moderna’s vaccine is one of 23 in human trials, and a handful entering phase 3 of clinical trials.Moderna is one of five pharmaceutical companies that have received billions from the US government, in a vaccine development initiative called Operation Warp Speed. Later this month, Moderna and a handful of other laboratories will begin recruiting tens of thousands of volunteers to take the vaccine.Coming studies must balance safety and efficacy. In other words, how large a dose of the vaccine is necessary to make it effective, while also minimizing unpleasant and potentially harmful side effects?“The safety and immunogenicity data in this preliminary report are promising, and they support continued development of this vaccine,” said Dr Penny M Heaton, the CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Medical Research Institute, in an editorial that accompanied Moderna’s study. “However, we must bear in mind the complexity of vaccine development and the work still to be done before Covid-19 vaccines are widely available.”Notably, Moderna researchers abandoned a higher dose of the vaccine because it did not appear to provide a better immune response and produced worse side effects, including headache, chills, fever and fatigue.At the same time, researchers must contend with Covid-19 antibody tests that can be unreliable. It is also unclear how long an immune response might last. One year? Six months? The Moderna study reported on findings after 57 days, though researchers will follow participants for one year.In addition, older people most vulnerable to Covid-19 may face special challenges. Older people may need more of the vaccine because their immune systems in general are less responsive. The same phenomenon takes place in influenza vaccines, Heaton wrote.In light of so many unknowns, fundamental questions remain about when and if a vaccine will be developed for Covid-19, and what it will look like once it is approved.“Everyone’s been saying, ‘We’re going to have these vaccines by the fall or the end of 2020,’ and I keep saying – no, we’re going to need those Phase 3 studies,” said Hotez. “We won’t have the information until third quarter of 2021, and even that would be a world land speed record.”The news has also renewed criticism about Operation Warp Speed and how to distribut an approved vaccine equitably in a world where taxpayers subsidized its development and demand will outstrip supply many times over.“We are now two months into Operation Warp Speed and people across the country still have no idea if the drug company executives Trump put in charge of it secured any assurances regarding access and affordability of vaccines developed with taxpayer dollars,” said Eli Zupnick, spokesman for Patients Over Pharma, a group critical of pharmaceutical companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7116b4330ed16d880f6d3c27e84fd12ea035e825/0_216_5529_3318/master/5529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1c509e89a4de5941b4032c61a03410a","title":"north macedonia social democrats election victory","story":"Party now faces wrangle to form coalition government in run-up to EU accession talksThe pro-western Social Democrats leader, Zoran Zaev, has declared victory in crucial elections in North Macedonia, saying the win paves the way for the Balkan state’s integration with Europe.“You are winners, be proud. Progress has won,” Zaev told ecstatic supporters, who were surrounded by party officials wearing protective masks.The 45-year-old leader, who has promised to impose policies to fast-track the country’s EU accession hopes, called the poll in January after the bloc initially refused to launch membership talks with the former Yugoslav republic.Much had hung on the election, held amid surging coronavirus infection rates and the first since the nation agreed to change its name – adding a geographical qualifier of “north” to Macedonia to appease Greek fears of territorial designs over its own province of Macedonia.Zaev had been the architect of the so-called Prespa accord, ending the long-standing dispute, and named after the lake around which it was signed with Athens’ leftist Syriza government two years ago. With the election victory secured by a mere 10,000 votes, a period of political horse-trading will follow. A workable coalition can only be formed with 61 seats in the 120-member parliament. Parties representing the country’s large ethnic Albanian minority, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its 2.1 million population, have emerged as kingmakers.The narrow victory will likely exacerbate polarisation over the controversial name deal, which the opposition opposed.“There is huge frustration that Zaev won,” Markovikj said. “Political polarisation over the Prespa agreement is likely to be even higher now. But if there was a chance to dispute it, and remove Zaev from power, it was this election. The accord is the Social Democrats’ child. It will now be solidified because they were more inclined to defend it and with it euro integration.”International officials monitored the election, which had been postponed since April due to the pandemic. Infections have soared in the landlocked state since restrictions were lifted, with authorities reporting more than 8,500 cases and 393 deaths as of Wednesday. Special provisions were made for about 700 people, either stricken with Covid-19 or in quarantine, to vote ahead of the poll. Elderly people and prison inmates were also permitted to cast ballots in advance.Many of the estimated 1.8 million eligible voters who have left North Macedonia and form part of the nation’s European diaspora were unable to return because of coronavirus.Zaev had faced a strong challenge from the populist VMRO-DPMNE party, whose leader, Hristijan Mickoski, has sought to move the party to the centre right since replacing its disgraced and exiled former leader Nikola Gruevski.The Social Democrats’ victory was welcomed by western observers based in Skopje amid hope it will help facilitate the country’s embrace by Europe. Moscow, which has long been accused of meddling in the region, had backed nationalist forces in North Macedonia.“Zaev managed to win the elections despite changing the name of the country,” said Eva Ellereit, the resident representative of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung German political foundation in Skopje. “Voters clearly want to see what he can put together now and how he can continue the pro-European reform agenda. The results are humbling but clear: the citizens of North Macedonia want to start accession talks with the EU, they do not want to return to the nationalist confrontations of the 1990s.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67fb20cb61fa0f8f7f55bd95f6d120c9f67449b/0_0_5669_3780/master/5669.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fead3f4394ce21304f2cfcd978f960f6 1760w","title":"coronavirus live news fauci says us must stop nonsense south africa cases top 300000","story":"Israel reports new daily record of cases if Tokyo Games don’t go ahead, Beijing 2022 also likely to be cancelled Fauci says US could make end-of-year target Bolsonaro tests positive againPhase one human trials of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford suggest it triggers two types of immune response, unnamed sources working on the vaccine have reportedly said.

We strongly recommend that production of the unattenuated virus begin immediately consistent with good manufacturing practices for potential use in trials that balance risks and benefits and respect the safety and autonomy of volunteers. It is also vitally important that there is both full transparency on the vaccine development and trial process and a erse group of trial participants necessary to provide a broadly effective and universally available vaccine.The organisation, 1 Day Sooner, which speaks for some volunteers taking part in trials tweeted a link to the letter Among those whose name appear on the letter is Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, where a massive effort has been under way to develop a UK vaccine for coronavirus within months and make it available to save lives before the end of the yearUkrainians are fed up with the coronavirus lockdown and the government should be cautious about extending it beyond August, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.“Everyone is tired of this quarantine,” the presidential press service quoted him as telling government officials.Ukraine imposed strict restrictions in March but partially eased them in May to allow economic recovery.It has been extending the lockdown monthly, with current rules in place until the end of July requiring people to wear masks and adhere to strict norms in restaurants and public places.“Therefore ... we will extend it for a month, but not longer.” That scenario would mean the lifting of lockdown restrictions at the end of August. Ukraine has recorded 56,455 coronavirus cases and 1,445 deaths – relatively low numbers compared with countries in western Europe but there have been worryingly high levels of new infections in recent weeks.Spain has paused to honour its tens of thousands of victims at a state ceremony joined by top EU and World Health Organization figures.The memorial took place barely three weeks after Spain ended its months-long state of emergency, but since then there has been a growing number of new infections, with health chiefs monitoring more than 120 active outbreaks.So far, the virus has officially killed 28,413 people in Spain, making it the seventh worst-hit country in the world.“Today, we are symbolically saying goodbye to mothers, fathers, children, siblings, friends: we take their hands, caress their cheek, kiss their forehead and remember their glance in our hearts,” Hernando Calleja, who lost his brother in April, said in an address at the ceremony.Presided over by Spain’s King Felipe VI, the memorial took place in a square outside the royal palace in Madrid in the presence of bereaved families and a host of top EU and WHO officials, with an orchestra playing Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings.“This act cannot heal the pain felt by so many families at not being at the side of their loved ones in their final hours ... but what it can do is pay tribute to their lives, to their contribution to our society, to their memories,” the king said.Among those present was the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who tweeted that he was honoured to be there.He added: “From its highest levels, the Spanish state has shown exemplary leadership to reverse the spread of the country’s #COVID19 outbreak, led by testing, contact tracing, treatment \u0026amp isolation.

And the list of Municipalities of Hope has dwindled to a few dozen.Israel faces the prospect of a fresh lockdown as a new daily record of confirmed coronavirus cases was reached.The country’s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,898 new cases of the virus, as it registered more than 44,500 total cases. At least 380 Israelis have died of Covid-19. It comes as a new economic plan announced by the embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, came under fire as the economy continues to struggle.Netanyahu had announced a plan on Wednesday to give out hundreds of dollars in economic aid to every Israeli citizen.Whereas the initial virus outbreak was concentrated predominantly in ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities, whose populations often live in poorer, crowded conditions, the health ministry has now warned the disease is spreading more widely.This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog in London from Alexandra Topping.

According to the World Health Organization, about 23 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, and more than 130 are in development.The biotech firm Moderna and the National Institutes of Health in the US said their vaccine provoked a desired immune response in 45 iniduals it will move on to larger-scale testing at the end of the month. The University of Oxford, which has paired with drugmaker AstraZeneca to create another vaccine, said it was anticipating “positive news” on early trials of its drug.Danielle Renwick has interviewed experts Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, and Anna Durbin, physician and professor, international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Read their thoughts here:The number of confirmed cases has passed 35,000 in Afghanistan, while the number of deaths has surged. Poverty will mainly impact households whose work or activities are vulnerable to lockdowns, such as small retail and daily labor in construction, agriculture, or personal services, according to a report by the World Bank which was released Wednesday.The report finds that economic activity plummeted in the first half of 2020 as lockdowns and social distancing measures to curb Covid-19 negatively impacted the industry and service sectors. Despite continued robust growth in agriculture following the recovery from the 2018 drought, lower outputs in industry and services, as well as declining revenues due to trade disruptions and weaker tax compliance have put government finances under pressure. Henry Kerali, the World Bank’s country director for Afghanistan, said:The Covid-19 crisis is having a devastating impact on the livelihoods of Afghans while undermining the government’s revenue collection and its capacity to finance comprehensive programmes to save lives, protect the poor, and jumpstart the economy.Short-term measures are needed to support households through the current crisis, while improvements in the business regulatory environment and maintaining the core functions of government will pave the way for longer-term recovery. Ongoing support from development partners will help finance critical government operations and restore private sector confidence. The World Bank is working closely with the government of Afghanistan both to implement the short-term response and lay the foundations for longer-term recovery.The number of deaths from Covid-19 rose by 21 from the previous day to stand at 1,115 on Thursday. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus had reached 35,070, an increase of 76 on the day before. There have been 22,881 recoveries. Kabul reported 19 deaths today. The capital has been the country’s worst-affected area with 409 deaths.The western province of Herat, which borders Iran, reported 16 new infections on Thursday. Local officials there have warned of a second wave of the virus in the province. Officials said the flow of Afghan refugees from Iran and the failure to follow health guidelines have increased the possibility of a new wave of the virus. Fresh outbreaks have already started in some areas and the virus is threatening the lives of thousands of people, according to officials.In France, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced that masks will be compulsory in all indoor public spaces from next week.

He issued the demand the day after prime minister Boris Johnson committed to holding an independent inquiry to “learn lessons” from the crisis.Speaking to reporters after visiting a care home in Gedling, Nottinghamshire, Starmer said frontline care workers had been “desperate” for access to tests, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak.They have said to me that they were frustrated and disappointed,” he said.“Even now the Health Secretary says there are weekly tests, and they are telling me they haven’t had tests for two weeks - they are still waiting for the next batch.“It is very important there is the inquiry and we need a commitment from the Prime Minister that getting to the bottom of what happened in care homes will be a priority for that inquiry.“I want him to make that commitment because what’s gone on in care homes has been absolutely awful.”On Wednesday, Johnson told MPs he did not believe now was the right time for an inquiry but it would “certainly” happen in the future.Britain has said Russia sought to interfere in the 2019 general election by illicitly acquiring sensitive documents relating to a planned free-trade agreement with the US and leaking them on social media.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “It is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents.”“Sensitive government documents relating to the UK-US free-trade agreement were illicitly acquired before the 2019 general election and disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit.”He added: “The government reserves the right to respond with appropriate measures in the future.”The equivalent of 20 double deckers busloads of litter was left strewn across London’s Royal Parks over month of lockdown. In June, 62 extra tonnes of rubbish were left in the eight parks compared with the same month last year – an increase of a third. Litter pickers spent more than 11,000 hours collecting more than 250 tonnes of rubbish in the same month.Royal Park managers described it as a “never-before-seen level of littering”, with office furniture, face masks and pizza boxes among the abandoned items picked up by staff. Tom Jarvis, director of parks, said: We’ve had lots of really nice messages from people thanking us for keeping the parks open and telling us how the parks have been a lifeline for them, particularly for those without gardens,” he said.“But the downside is the litter. We’ve never seen anything like this before.“Every day we wake up to unprecedented levels of litter, with PPE, pizza boxes, plastic bags and picnic scraps strewn all over the grass.”He added: “We’re asking everyone who visits the parks for a bit of help to spread some kindness this summer and help us look after the environment.People who are shielding in Wales will no longer need to do so after 16 August, the country’s chief medical officer has confirmed. Dr Frank Atherton said the 130,000 people in Wales who have been advised to shield could go to work, school or shopping from that date. He added:As the level of the virus in our communities is now low, shielding should pause from August 16.”This means those who have been shielding can gradually resume day-to-day life, but taking extra care around physical distancing and hand washing.“We will keep this under review and if we see transmission levels increase, we may need to consider advising the shielding group to take extra precautions and measures to protect themselves in the future.Figures released by the Department for Health and Social Care show that as of 8 July, an estimated 741,021 coronavirus tests had been carried out on workers in UK social care settings. The number includes symptomatic household members. An estimated 352,946 tests have been carried out on care home residents. However, the estimates are not an indication of the number of people tested, as some people have been tested more than once.

An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has revealed that the proposals – which Rishi Sunak said could amount to up to £30bn in support – are partly funded by spending cuts on previously planned projects and investments. The thinktank said the failure to clarify this in its plans was “corrosive to trust”. Sunak’s Plan for Jobs will ultimately cost around £20bn, the IFS said, adding that it was revealed with “much less fanfare” that there were reductions in previously planned spending.According to the IFS, the Treasury’s decisions on funding for the devolved administrations suggest they expect these underspends to amount to almost £8bn, while the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects it to be around £10bn.In its summer economic update last week, the UK government launched its £30bn Plan for Jobs.What it didn’t say was that almost £8bn of that is to be paid for by spending less than previously planned on other things.Indeed, the whole of the £5bn of additional capital spending trumpeted by the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in fact represents funding previously allocated to other capital projects which will no longer happen this year.The IFS said the £2bn green homes grant announced by the chancellor is funded from within pre-existing spending limits, while almost half the £400m for traineeships and apprenticeships is reallocated money.The proportion of people receiving Covid-19 test results from regional or mobile testing units within 24 hours has fallen week-on-week. Last month, Boris Johnson pledged to get the results of all in-person tests back within 24 hours by the end of June He told the House of Commons he would get “all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that”.The latest NHS Test and Trace data has been published by the Department of Health and Social Care.

The government is to finally publish the greatly anticipated Russia report before the summer parliamentary recess begins next week.A statement from the intelligence and security committee said:The intelligence and security committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the Report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess. There will be no further comment. The committee produced a report on alleged Russian interference in UK politics which was supposed to be published before last year’s general election. But the prime minister Boris Johnson withheld its release, promising it would be published “in due course”.There will be more on this as we get it.Michael Gove has confirmed that up to five sites in Kent will be used as Brexit border facilities as the government confirms purchase of the vast Kent site for customs clearance and a lorry park. Just days after the Cabinet Office minister said it was not the intent to use it as a lorry park, the Department for Transport has written to residents in Ashford to confirm the move, first revealed by the  on Friday. Local MP Damian Green, a former close ally of Theresa May, criticised the move on Monday as “wrong headed” attacking the lack of consultation on a scheme that would affect those who were buying new houses next to the site and the local hospital. The new chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee has condemned Downing Street’s attempt to impose its “preferred candidate” to lead the committee.Lewis said he did not respond to a call to vote for former cabinet minister Chris Grayling as he considered it to be an “improper request”.Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members.In a statement, he said that the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members.It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair.I did not reply as I considered it an improper request.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed. Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.And, in a further precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease, the Government has extended the mandatory wearing of face coverings to shops, shopping centres and retail workers where there is no protective screen or a two-metre distance between them and their customers.The rise in the number of infections from “unrestricted house parties” has led the Government to recommend social visits to other people’s homes be limited to 10 visitors from no more than four households.The advice against unnecessary travel overseas has been extended but the Government still plans to publish a “green list” of countries with similar levels of infection rates that people can travel to, though it is maintaining advice against non-essential foreign travel. Reproduction numberTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government was not proceeding with the fourth reopening phase as the reproduction number of the virus, a key metric tracked to assess the rate of infection, had risen above one, meaning it was spreading in the community.Mr Martin said the virus had not changed and “remains as indiscriminate in its cruelty as it has since it arrived, and it remains as relentless as ever in its effort to find new hosts”.Getting the “R number” back below one would give the Government the best possible chance to reopen schools in late August and to resume essential healthcare, he said. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) was “worried about the trajectory” of the virus, Mr Martin said, and if it continued to spread at the current rate, it could jeopardise plans to reopen schools. The Taoiseach also said there needed to be “better follow-up” to ensure visitors arriving into the country were complying with the 14-day self-isolating period. He promised an increased presence of compliance staff and communications at ports and airports and more extensive tracing.The State’s acting chief medical officer, Dr Ronan Glynn, said the 14-day incidence rate of the disease had risen from a low of 2.5 cases per 100,000 people to 3.9 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday.“This virus is extremely infectious. It wants to spread but it wants people to come in contact with each other to do so,” he said. Dr Glynn said the R number was between 1.2 and 1.8, which means that for every five infected people, the disease will spread to between six and nine other people. He said there had been large clusters linked to private homes, in some cases infecting 40-50 people.The pause in lifting of restrictions marks the first time public officials have delayed reopening since the country first started to emerge from lockdown in May.Covid-19 figuresThe NPHET reported another two coronavirus-related deaths and 14 new confirmed cases, bringing to 145 cases over the past seven days. And the number of clusters – defined as two cases or more – in private homes increased by 96 in the week to last Sunday, according to figures from the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Representatives of the pub trade reacted angrily to the Government’s decision describing the delay in the reopening of about 3,500 pubs as a “hammer blow” to the industry.Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, said rural family-run pubs would bear the brunt of the decision. And Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association, said it was a “crushing blow” for pubs which will be unable to trade for 40 per cent of the year.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Celebration for 500 people had been planned before Covid-19 restrictions extendedDecision to delay reopening pubs and resumption of large gatherings will help return to education, Harris saysIncreasing proportion of these contacts are not coming forward for testing, briefing is toldDetective says he can connect accused with firearm through DNA evidenceNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryFace coverings to become mandatory in shops and shopping centresQuantum computers could perform billions of times faster than current supercomputerThose who have recovered from coronavirus \u0026lsquounlikely\u0026rsquo to see impact on premiums or coverSwan owner Ronan Lynch brands decision to push back opening three weeks \u0026lsquoa disgrace\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader will seek to promote \u0026lsquopractical\u0026rsquo co-operation during delayed visitSector now \u0026lsquooverlooked\u0026rsquo as driving lessons brought foward in reopening planProcess to deal with claims cannot be established until new members chosenF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland director does not want tourists at his hotel who have not quarantinedThat\u0026rsquos Maths: Influential Hungarian took up position in Dias in 1954New strategy: Students able to select further-education courses alongside CAO picksUK government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound2bn insufficient in light of coronavirus, cross-party group saysBenjamin Blackwell, now aged 15, claims he contracted narcolepsy after getting Pandemrix jabStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306123.1594901470!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government urges close contacts of positive cases to get tested","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLiz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach: ‘If you are asked to get a test, please do so’The Government has urged people who are identified as close contacts to positive coronavirus cases to get tested for the condition, following reports some people are not coming forward.Speaking at Government buildings on Thursday, Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the proportion of people who are refusing to be tested is increasing.“Public health doctors are reporting an increase in the number of clusters around the country in recent days but they’re also reporting an increasing proportion of people identified as close contacts of positive cases who, when offerred a test, are not coming forward to be tested,” Ms Canavan said.Ms Canavan was speaking following the Government decision on Thursday to push back phase four of the roadmap for reopening society until August 10th due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the community.The decision means, among other things, that pubs, bars and nightclubs will not be allowed to reopen as planned on July 20th. Currently, pubs are only allowed to operate if they are also providing a “substantial meal” – of at least €9 – to customers.Ms Canavan said that between July 3rd and July 12th, gardaí identified 37 inidual cases where there were “potential breaches of the health regulations . . . even after providing the premises with an opportunity to rectify the situation”.“In all of these cases, gardaí found customers consuming alcohol but no evidence of food also being consumed and no evidence of receipts to show that food has been sold. Files will now be prepared by the DPP in each of these cases,” she added.Ms Canavan said she understands “how disappointing” the decision to pause phase four is for business owners, employees and the public but added it is better to “pause now and avoid risking any reversal”.She explained why the Government made the distinction between food-serving premises and pubs, adding “we all know the difference between our behaviour and our expectations when we go into a restaurant as opposed to a pub”.Ms Canavan said that “to support the sector and, acknowledging the very strong food business for many publicans”, the Government permitted pubs acting as restaurants to reopen.“The National Public Health and Emergency Team have doubled down on their ask of pubs that are open to behave as restaurants, and the guidance on what that means is clear,” she said.Despite the pausing of phase four, and the addition of other measures – such as mandatory wearing of face covering in shops and indoor spaces – Ms Canavan said “we are still in a very good place with the disease”.“The trend in infections has crept up, in a small way and slowly, but that small increase is persisting. The problem is the nature of this disease. It’s highly infectious, it spreads fast.”Earlier on Thursday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said pubs reopenimg now could “materially add to the possibility of a second wave” of the coronavirus.The Government would be prioritising the reopening of schools and healthcare facilities, the minister told Morning Ireland.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one. At present it is between 1.2 and 1.8, if that rate were to continue within three weeks the rate would be up to 150 cases per day, he warned. Mr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris has admitted phase four of the Government’s roadmap to reopen the country could be pushed back further if there is an increase in Covid-19 cases. The Government delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown on Wednesday, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people until August 10th. Mr Harris said this could be further postponed if cases continue to rise but added “I would hope that not to be the case.”“We can’t presume that Covid-19 is gone because it’s not,” Mr Harris said. The Minister also said the decision not to proceed with the next stage “increases the ability” to ensure children return to education in late August and early September.“I think it would have been a grossly irresponsible thing to ignore public health advice, to move forward with phase four in spite of the public health advice, knowing that we have a huge body of work to do as a country to get our kids back to school and indeed get our learners and students back into third level as well,” he told reporters on Thursday morning. Mr Harris said a “huge body of work” is being led by the Minister for Education Norma Foley to make sure schools can reopen at the end of next month. He said his department is finalising a framework for universities and colleges to reopen. The Minister echoed Tanaiste Leo Varadkar’s comments on Wednesday that the recent rise in Covid-19 cases in Ireland “is not a second wave”. “The Tánaiste is right, there isn’t an indication that there is a second wave here currently, but there are enough warning signs for us to press pause, try and bank the progress that we have made, and I suppose reignite the conversation with each other about the measures we need to take in terms of social distancing, hand washing, cough etiquette and keeping close contacts as minimum as we can,” Mr Harris said.“As of now the indicative date is August 10th but we’ve always been very honest with people. These are indicative dates and they entirely depend on the behaviour of the virus but we are not powerless in that regard,” he said.Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of the National Further Education and Training Strategy at Richmond Barracks in Dublin. Mr Harris said everybody wants to protect their own health and the health of students and staff but “equally we need to get people back to education”. “We can’t live in a country where we’ve nearly opened up everything else except our education sector. I think that would reflect very badly on our values as a country that values education and sees that the benefit of education runs far beyond just academic benefits too,” he said. The Minister also said the country is “absolutely open” to international students this coming semester. Mr Harris said he has heard from some universities that there are international students who would be willing to come to Ireland in September and quarantine for the recommended two-week period. Earlier Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it could “materially add to the possibility of a second wave” of the coronavirus of pubs reopened now.The Government would be prioritising the reopening of schools and healthcare facilities, the minister told Morning Ireland.The Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one.

International evidenceMr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”. He added that he hoped there would be no need for enforcement of wearing face covering in shops.The Minister said that the Government is taking Nphet advice to limit gatherings in homes to no more than 10 visitors. “It’s not 10 people, so if there’s five of you living in the house then you can be up to 15. Nphet have said for no more than four additional households which means essentially whoever lives in the house plus up to 10 people.”He said health are worried about clusters of cases.“What you can have is one person who is infected, but they are asymptomatic, they don’t know they are, they go to a house party, everyone’s talking loudly, there’s plenty of droplets going out into the air, you can end up with 20 to 30 people walking out of that house infected.”Mr Donnelly said the Government did not make the decision lightly. “But the public health advice is if we were to open now it could materially add to the possibility of a second wave and that’s just a risk we can take.”The lifting of the remaining restrictions would depend on the R rating he said. “It’s not one number, it’s not one fact, it’s in the round, where are we going, are we moving away from a second wave or are we moving towards a second wave.”Hospitality industryThe Government’s decision disappointed members of the hospitality industry.The president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said “hitting the pause button” on the relaxation of Covid-19 regulations will put thousands of jobs at risk at a time when hotel room occupancy is only 30 per cent.The pause will also have an impact on people who had planned gatherings in hotels and wedding venues, she said.Around 18,000 couples this year will have their wedding day plans impacted by Covid-19 with many already changing their arrangements two to three times, she added.However, Infectious diseases consultant Corrina Sadlier has said the Government’s decision to pause the relaxing of the lockdown was the right thing to do.She said she understood this would cause extreme difficulties for the sectors affected, but “nothing about Covid-19 has been easy for anyone”.If the pause had not been implemented the country had been heading towards a second wave, she warned.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe delay in allowing pubs to reopen has been described as “devastating” by a third-generation Dublin publican who said everything was already in place for a planned reopening next Monday.The Swan, on the corner of Aungier Street and York Street in Dublin 2, is one of a handful of Victorian pubs left in the city. Its owner, Ronan Lynch, said the decision was “a disgrace”.He pointed out that he had a range of health-and-safety measures planned including social distancing and hand sanitisation stations and strict guidelines for staff to follow.He accused the Government of failing to even discuss any details of the measures already taken and those which were still required with the industry.“This is absolutely devastating,” he said. “We have been closed for 18 weeks and were the first and hardest hit sector . We all have financial commitments and things are just going to get harder and harder. It is so frustrating because we have not had any communication from Government as to what more we need to do.”He said the successful reopening at the end of June of pubs that serve food had given the sector great confidence that the remaining pubs would be facilitated from Monday, which made the news even harder to swallow.“There has been no dialogue from Government, it has been appalling, and we will end up being closed for 40 per cent of the year. We missed St Patrick’s Day, the end of the football and rugby season, all other sports and the tourist season, and on top of all that we have Brexit coming down the tracks.”He said what made it harder to understand was that publicans were already accustomed to managing customers better than most other sectors and knew how to control their space in a responsible fashion.‘Devastation’His views were echoed by others in the pub trade.“It is just devastation for us, the work we have put in to be ready for Monday for them to simply say we can’t reopen for another three weeks,” said Paul Moynihan of Moynihan’s Bar in Donard, Co Wicklow. “And it will be devastating for our customers too.”He pointed out that house parties and other social gatherings would continue where there would be few guidelines followed, “and yet we are the ones being kicked in the teeth”.“I can’t fathom it. Even on a personal level I was really looking forward to seeing our customers again, and we would have been well able to control it, but nobody appears to be listening to us.”Walsh’s pub in Stoneybatter has reconfigured its operation so it can reopen as planned on Monday.“The delay is simply not fair on so many pubs,” owner Anthony Malone said. “We were concerned this might happen and have been planning to offer food, and that is what we will do. Everything will be by the book and it will hopefully be another small step back to normal.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305303.1594832126!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public health ahead of commercial reality says hotelier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeitrim Sean Nós dancer-videographer Edwina Guckian and her son Páidí  with singer Eleanor Shanley  working on the   Enjoy Leitrim promotional video. Photograph: Brian FarrellA Co Leitrim hotelier has said while the consequences of the 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas visitors will be economically catastrophic, he does not want tourists who have not followed the rule staying at his hotel. Joe Dolan, a director of Fáilte Ireland and former president of the Irish Hotels Federation, said public health “has to take precedence over commercial reality” during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would frown on overseas visitors who had not quarantined coming into my hotel,” he said. Mr Dolan, who owns the Bush Hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon, said he was “speaking with my heart and not my head” and understood the logic of the 14-day isolation requirement. “I wish it were not the case, but it is probably necessary. But the economic consequences for Ireland will be catastrophic because this will eliminate all short-stay visitors, including from the UK, our biggest market,” he said. He was speaking in advance of the launch of Enjoy Leitrim, a three-minute promotional video he has commissioned showcasing the benefits of visiting and living in the county. The video includes contributions from locally based writers and musicians including Michael Harding, Seamus O’Rourke, Eleanor Shanley and Charlie McGettigan, and will be launched on Thursday on the Leitrim Tourism social media channels. Edwina Guckian of Dreoilín Productions, who made the video during the lockdown, said the timing meant she was forced to focus on the county’s landscape rather than its people. “Myself and the four artists who were involved wanted to get the message across that we should appreciate what we have here, and this has been brought home to us during the pandemic,” she said. “We want people to know there is more out there than the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs of Moher.” Mr Dolan said the current circumstances were making it extremely difficult for the tourism sector in Leitrim and around the country to operate, with many businesses expected to decide at the end of the summer whether to shut up shop for the winter. “For some it will be a case that they will lose less money by being closed than by staying open,” he said. Subsidy schemeHe added that while the Government’s Wage Subsidy Scheme had been crucial to the survival of many businesses including his own during the pandemic, other measures were needed such as waivers on rates and water charges. The owner of the 65-bedroom hotel, who laid off his staff at the start of the coronavirus lockdown, said he had 65 staff at the height of last year’s tourist season but only about half of that number had so far returned, though others were due back next week. “I would have to close my doors tomorrow without the Wage Subsidy Scheme,” said the hotelier, who believes he is luckier than many as almost 80 per cent of his business is domestic. He said the general consensus in the hotel sector was that while “you can’t get a cottage in the country for love nor money”, hotel room occupancy would be 25-33 per cent this year with consumer confidence a big factor. Mr Dolan also said a Government announcement about a package for the hospitality sector was expected and he believed a lot of businesses would need a non-repayable grant scheme to bridge the difference “between what we need to borrow and want we can afford to repay”. A cut in the VAT rate for the sector would be a key factor in stimulating bookings and sales, he added. “The last cut in VAT was very effective , the most innovative job creation strategy after the financial crisis,” he said.

It’s definitely bigger than M Martin. I have apologised for my actions. I made a stupid mistake but I did not do what they have accused me of,” he texted.The Taoiseach also told the Dáil he had “never sought in any shape or form to undermine . . . the accuracy or credibility of any Garda statement on the file”.That put his position on the Garda Pulse report of the incident directly at odds with that of Mr Cowen. The Offaly TD has strongly refuted a statement in the report that he tried to evade a Garda checkpoint.The  understands the Garda Pulse record is brief and says Mr Cowen turned his car off the road ahead of gardaí up ahead.It suggests that when the gardaí went to check where his car had gone, they engaged him in conversation and detected the drink-driving offence.No vettingGardaí have also said they process requests for access to personal data without preferential treatment and do not carry out ministerial vetting.Fianna Fáil TDs contacted yesterday said as many as a third of the party’s members would be sceptical of, or openly opposed to, Mr Martin’s leadership. One said a substantial minority believed the coalition with Fine Gael could lead to the ruination of the party.Another TD said: “Those outside the fold believe Micheál is a spent docket. The only question is: will there be a challenge to him sooner rather than later?”In a move widely expected, deputy leader Dara Calleary was appointed new Minister for Agriculture. Dublin West TD Jack Chambers has been named as Mr Calleary’s successor as chief whip with responsibility for the Gaeltacht. In a tweet he promised to work hard to improve his Irish.

He issues a statement saying he is “profoundly sorry”. He also lets it be known he now has a full driving licence but does not disclose when he made the test.Sunday, July 5th:The situation has now become a crisis for Fianna Fáil. The party has earlier had to contend with internal ructions over ministerial appointments. Cowen, in the first of a series of apologies, is a guest on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics.He makes a candid apology. “The fact of the matter was it was a terribly stupid, stupid, mistake on my part,” he says. “It is something that I am very regretful for.”He admits that he had driven unaccompanied on occasions when on a learner permit and says, in hindsight, maybe he should have informed Micheál Martin at the time.Paul Murphy, the Rise TD, says it is “bizarre” that anybody who is close to 50 did not have a full licence.Further stories emerge about a speeding ticket and another minor road traffic infractions, seemingly gleaned from a Garda Pulse report.Monday, July 6th:Amid persistent demands from the Opposition for more clarity, it emerges that Cowen has contacted the Ceann Comhairle asking to make a personal statement on the matter in the Dáil. It is agreed he will speak the following day.Micheál Martin seems reassured by Cowen’s apology and explanation for not contacting him earlier. “He was deeply ashamed of it and embarrassed that the incident occurred in 2016,” he says.Tuesday July 7th:Cowen makes a personal statement in the Dáil at 9pm. He again apologises about his “stupid mistake”.He explains for the first time the details of his drink-driving arrest. It happened on the day of the All Ireland football final. He was stopped in Co Kildare as he was returning to Co Offaly with a friend.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a Breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.”While he was on a provisional licence at the time, he says “I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence.“Before reform it was not uncommon for people of all ages and experience to be on a provisional licence.”He also says he has spoken to a number of road safety campaigners earlier that day including Susan Gray of Parc. He says he had apologised to them.But Gray later criticises Cowen, saying he failed to address various aspects of his driving licence. She and others call for him to specify how many learner permits he held, and if he displayed “L” or “N” plates on his car.Sunday, July 12th:The controversy seems to have receded a bit. However, The Sunday Times now reports details of the Garda record of the September 2016 incident which alleges the Offaly TD was pursed by gardaí after doing a U-turn before a Garda checkpoint.Cowen begins a robust defence. He claims the Garda record is “incorrect” and says the fact that gardaí leaked a Pulse record was an act of criminality.He states that he had never evaded or avoided a Garda checkpoint. “I did not evade or attempt to evade a garda. Such an act would constitute a serious criminal offence,” he says.It was, arguably, a more serious offence than the drink-driving ban. Under Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act failure to stop a vehicle when required by a Garda is a criminal offence, punishable by fine, andor imprisonment.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) is asked by the Garda to investigate the circumstances in which the confidential Garda Pulse record of the incident was leaked to the media.Other details are now emerging. It is clear that copies of the Garda Pulse record had been leaked to reporters at least ten days before then. And the record contained the allegation that Cowen had tried to avoid the checkpoint.This allegation of evasion had been put to Cowen and to Fianna Fáil as early as July 3rd, nine days beforehand. However, Cowen had denied it very strenuously. It had not appeared in earlier media reports and Cowen himself had made no reference to it.The previous week Martin had briefed Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green leader Eamon Ryan on the incident but had made no mention of the alleged evasion of the checkpoint. Varadkar had said he did not want any more surprises.Monday, July 13th:Perhaps the day that sealed Barry Cowen’s fate. Asked for comment by RTÉ’s Midlands Correspondent Ciarán Mulooly, Cowen says that under legal advice he was not making any further comment until such time as Gsoc issued its report.Varadkar is interviewed on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. He refers to his comments from the previous week where he wanted no more surprises and then refers to the new revelations. However, the thrust of his interview is calibrated. He does not call for a head and seems to accept that perhaps allowing the Gsoc investigation to follow its course might be the preferable option.Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin, speaking on Newstalk, says Cowen needs to clarify matters further.That is the theme being pursued by the Opposition parties who are asking Cowen to make a new statement and also to answer questions in the Dáil. Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly says the fact there was a dispute between his account and that of the Garda record showed the need for him to answer questions in the Dáil.\u0026nbsp“He has said he wants to draw a line under it, the Taoiseach says he wants to draw a line under it. Clearly a line has not been drawn under it. We are still talking about it now ten days after it was first revealed.”The previous week, Cowen had requested and received the Pulse report of the incident from the Garda. He and Martin have a lengthy conversation on Monday night about the record. Martin asks to see it.As questions are raised about the source of the leaks, the Meath East TD Thomas Byrne rejects suggestions that he had tipped off the media about Cowen’s run-in with the Garda.“There’s a civil matter in relation to this. It does not involve me. I’m on good terms with Barry Cowen,” he tells LMFM in an interview.Tuesday July 14th:Micheál Martin and Cowen meet to further discuss the matter. Cowen shows Martin the Pulse report, which suggests a more benign interpretation of events than had been portrayed by the media.Martin lets Cowen know that in his view a “comprehensive statement was required” and that he as Minister and an office holder was obliged to come before the House to explain himself.“In my view, the issue could only be resolved with the political route.”Martin tells Cowen it does not have to be on Tuesday, or even Wednesday but at some stage a comprehensive statement is required.At around 11.30am, Martin meets Varadkar and Ryan and tells them that Cowen has said he will make no further statement and he has had asked him to reflect on his position. Both said they agreed with his position and would support what decision he would make.Sources in both parties insist that neither forced the issue in any way or “sought a head on a plate”.“I thought when the Taoiseach went in at 2pm he was actually going to announce that Cowen was gone,” said one.In the event, Martin gave a partial defence of Cowen under questioning in the Dáil from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. Again he referred to some ambiguity in the Pulse record.“I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed. \u0026nbspNonetheless, the document is there.”In those sentences, he was outlining the problem (the Pulse document existed and needed to be explained) and the possible solution for Cowen (a more benign reading of it).But it needed Cowen to agree to make a fresh statement before the Dáil and answer questions.Shortly after Leaders’ Questions Martin went to the canteen in Leinster House and spoke casually to journalists. He pointed out that the statement made no explicit reference to a “U-turn”. It seemed to suggest that he was still holding out hope Cowen would change his mind.The relatively spirited defence of Cowen, plus the refusal to allow a statement, suggested that the Government was holding a line and was now prepared to weather out the controversy. Those with experience of previous occasions when office holders were sacked or resigned were familiar with the temporal arc. The controversy would reach a point where the pressure was so unbearable and the clamour so frenzied that the Minister was holding on by a thread. One more sliver of trouble would be enough to topple him or her.As one former Fine Gael minister said on Tuesday: “It had not reached that point. It was much too early. Nobody had any expectation that he was about to get sacked.”And that’s why it took so many by surprise. Just before 9pm, Martin went to the Dáil to announce he had sacked Cowen over his refusal to make a further statement. He said there were questions that needed clarification and it was not tenable for other Ministers to provide a proxy for Cowen by trying to answer them.So what happened in the intervening seven hours? Well, it seemed that well before 2pm, Martin had already made up his mind that Cowen had to go if he refused to make a second statement.His defence of him in the Dáil was affording the Offaly TD a final chance to address the issues. Later that afternoon he formally asked Cowen to reconsider. Cowen refused. He then asked him to resign. He refused. The plank was now readied.Within half an hour of the bombshell, Cowen responded with a lengthy statement on Twitter, with a direct cut at Martin for sacking him only seven hours after backing him.“Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process,” he said.Publicly, Fianna Fáil TDs strongly backed the Taoiseach’s decision, praising him for being decisive. They also expressed personal sympathy for Cowen, who is popular and respected by his colleagues.Wednesday July 15th:Martin’s disposition was matter-of-fact and unruffled during Leaders Questions in the Dáil’s temporary home of the National Convention Centre. He refuted Mary Lou McDonald’s claim that he (Martin) challenged the Garda report, arguing that he had never done that, and that was why he expected Cowen to make a clarification.Cowen arrives at the centre and goes into the chamber. He is seen talking to John McGuinness and, later, to Eamon O Cuív. They may be chance encounters but they underline the potential split within the party. Backbench TDs in the canteen are bemused - they refer to it as the worst possible start in Government.Nobody quibbles when Dara Calleary is announced as the new Minister.Martin continues to face questions about the matter from Opposition TDs. However, as the day continues, it is the Apple judgement that begins to dominate the agenda. A potential crisis has been allayed for now."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Cases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December. Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Photograph: Nicolas AsfouriAFP via Getty ImagesFerocious partisanship has its uses. If nothing else, a ided nation can console itself that no government idea goes unexamined and unopposed. Scrutiny can be all the more exacting for being born of tribal malice rather than Socratic truth-seeking. The US is riven – it has managed to politicise the workaday face-mask – but it avoids the equal and opposite danger of unreflective consensus.Except, that is, on the most momentous policy of the century. To be in Washington is to sense a nation sliding into open-ended conflict against China with eerily little debate. Politicians who can be counted on to dispute the colour of the sky or the sum of two plus two are of a piece on the necessity of a superpower duel. In the Rambo trailers that pass for his campaign ads, Joe Biden faults President Donald Trump’s China line only for its softness.Nor is the Democratic candidate for the White House a rare belligerent in his party. Chuck Schumer, who leads it in the Senate, has urged the president to “hang tough” on tariffs for “strength is the only way to win with China”. He was not pressed to say what in the historic record justifies this coffee-mug banality, or against which nation he would ever counsel weakness. No, that would require debate. Neither in Washington nor in the corporate sector is there much to be found, at least on the record. Academics have been more forthcoming with their qualms, but not in great number or to great effect.The result is that un-American thing, consensus, and it concerns not just the future but increasingly the past. Everyone now “knows” that pre-Trump Washington was a place of Whiggish credulity, forever betting on material enrichment to make of China a vast Japan or South Korea: a democracy, a friend. In this account, its admittance to the World Trade Organisation was the inadvertent crowning of a rival by American enablers.Leave aside the slander against presidents from George HW Bush (who defied Beijing to arm Taiwan) to Barack Obama (who put tariffs on Chinese tyres). Leave aside the idea that America’s only options are liberal naïvéte and a second cold war. As in the 1940s, when the US was said to have “lost” China to communism, the premise here is that Earth’s most populous country, and oldest living civilisation, rises and falls in response to US policy. That it has agency of its own, that its post-1978 reforms were going to restore its stature anyway is, in Washington, a more exotic suggestion than it should be.Minority reportsNone of this is a plea for (how easily the Soviet-era patter returns) detente. It might be that a US-China struggle is not just defensible, but ordained. We know the international-relations theory by now. A surging power, an established one a one-party state, a democracy: the raw materials for conflict are there. But it is possible to believe all this and still feel unnerved by the lack of public deliberation and prominent dissenters. Even at the dawn of the cold war, there was Senator Robert Taft to argue against Nato. There was diplomat George Kennan, the 20th century’s most unwittingly important man, who viewed “containment” as a bellicose misreading of his advice. And these minority reports were filed in a much more deferential America than today’s.The absence of such voices now is disconcerting. For it means that policy is not being refined and stress-tested through argument. It is no longer clear, for instance, if US grievances stop at China’s trade practices or reach into its domestic treatment of its own people. Mikes Pence and Pompeo, the vice-president and secretary of state, flag the second more often than Trump does. Democrats mention it more than Republicans. This mission creep, if it is afoot, rather matters. An economic rivalry would be fraught enough. One that pits governing philosophies against each other is much harder to finesse.Another implication of the consensus is that dissent is becoming a political no-no. There is a dark past to contend with here. It is forgotten that McCarthyism’s breakthrough had little to do with Russia. It was that alleged loss of China. American diplomats were hounded by their own lawmakers (the right mastered cancel culture first). When President Harry Truman cashiered general Douglas MacArthur, who itched to strike China, not everyone sided with civilian over military power.Washington now is nowhere near that level of frenzy. Even by the standards of an election year, though, the reluctance to say anything construable as “soft” is impossible to miss. America’s ultimate advantage is the raucousness of its public discourse. On the China question, it is troublingly civilised. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 organisation centre storm","story":"On the 7th of April, Donald Trump tweeted “The W.H.O. really blew it.

He would then stay somewhere else. This happened on so many occasions that it is not possible for me to remember them all in detail. However, I would describe it as a recurring cycle that Ms Heard would abuse Mr Depp, who would then remove himself from the situation.Mr Depp, 57, is suing the tabloid\u0027s publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards Ms Heard, 34, throughout their relationship.Mr Depp denies ever hitting Ms Heard or being abusive towards her.Appearing in support of the actor Mr Bett, a former officer at Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department, said problems would frequently arise from Ms Heard\u0027s habit of drinking large quantities of red wine.He said: Ms Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognize the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further. I also knew that she could be violent towards Mr Depp, so it was important that he did not remain in a situation with Ms Heard when she was in this kind of abusive mood.Mr Bett, who admitted in court that he found Ms Heard to be perfectly polite when he was on his own with her without Mr Depp, said he had never seen the actor physically abusing his wife or anyone else.He said: “I have never seen Mr Depp being violent to anyone including Ms Heard during the long period I have been working for him. In addition, I have observed Ms Heard throwing bottles, glasses and other objects at Mr Depp while being verbally abusive towards him. As a rule, during these episodes Mr Depp remains fairly passive and either tries to calm Ms Heard down or remove himself from the situation.Mr Bett told the court he took a number of photographs of injuries to Mr Depp which he claims were caused by Ms Heard, including one showing a red mark to his cheek taken in March 2015, and another showing a scratch and reddening around his nose, taken in December 2015.He said the photograph was taken after “Mr Depp said Ms Heard slapped him in the face”.Mr Bett told the court that following the couple’s arguments he would sometimes be asked by Mr Depp to drive Ms Heard home to the Eastern Columbia Buildings from his Sweetzer Avenue property in Los Angeles, to make sure she got home safely.The bodyguard said: During these times she would be crying, saying how much she loved Mr Depp and she\u0027s tired of the arguing, and I would tell her, \u0027well this has to stop between you two\u0027.He told the court that he did not see any marks or bruises on her during these journeys.Sasha Wass QC, NGN\u0027s barrister, suggested Mr Bett was lying about the lack of visible injuries on Ms Heard\u0027s face. She had visible reddening, she said.Mr Bett responded: You can call me a liar 100 times. I\u0027m not, I\u0027m telling the truth.The actor\u0027s legal team decided on Thursday they would not need to call actresses Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis.Mr Depp’s former partners were due to give evidence over a video link but his barrister David Sherborne said there was no need to call them since the defendants’ case is that the actor was violent to Ms Heard and not other women.He told the court: There is no need to reschedule those witnesses, much as it would have been a pleasure to have them here.The Pirates Of The Caribbean star is suing NGN and Mr Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018 with the headline: Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?.His lawyers say the article bore the meaning there was overwhelming evidence Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on a number of occasions and left her in fear for her life.Ms Heard claims that during one incident in Australia she was subjected to a three-day hostage situation during which Mr Depp drank to excess and took pills.NGN is defending the article as true, and says Mr Depp was controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Ms Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"danish ice cream maker drops eskimo name avoiding offending","story":"A Danish ice-cream company has said it will rename one of its classic varieties due to the potential for the name “Eskimo” to cause offense to the native people of Greenland.After initial reluctance to change the name of its vanilla and chocolate offering, “a process of dialogue and reflection made it clear to us that people feel the name Eskimo reminds them of a past of degradation and unfair treatment,” Hansen’s ice cream maker said in a statement.The company remarked that the name Eskimo had been used throughout its 100-year history, but that a recent debate about unfair treatment of indigenous people had prompted a change of heart.Eskimo is popularly used in Denmark as a name for vanilla ice cream coated in chocolate. Another ice cream company, Premier, has resisted pressure to change the name of its “Giant Eskimo” variety.Meanwhile a chocolatier in the town of Fredriksberg has refused to alter its menu after finding itself at  the centre of a social media storm for selling waffles covered in “Eskimo” ice cream.Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, one of two MPs for Greenland in the Danish parliament, welcomed Hansen’s name change. Eskimo has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders. So I think it is only natural to show this level of respect for us, she said.While the exact origin of the word Eskimo remains unclear, a reason commonly given for its offensiveness - that it means “eater of raw meat” - is now largely discredited.More likely, it comes from the French esquimaux, meaning one who nets snowshoes. Many of the indigenous people of the Arctic region of North America prefer the word Inuit, meaning “people”. Others, particularly natives of Alaska, continue to refer to themselves as Eskimos, as Inuit has no meaning in their language. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16th july 2020","story":"Indonesian Clowns use face shields while entertaining children in refugee camps, in Jakarta, IndonesiaTravel latest: Nicola Sturgeon \u0026#39will not shy away\u0026#39 from quarantine for English visitorsCoronavirus latest news: More than a quarter of close contacts not reached by NHS Test and TracePolitics latest news: Russians tried to interfere in 2019 election by promoting document touted by Jeremy Corbyn Do face masks work?

It was photographed close to the starboard side of the ferry.The report says the two vessels could have been within 100m of each other as the ferry, which had 282 passengers and crew on board, took the avoiding action.Although aware of the ferry, the submarine’s control room team had overestimated the civilian craft’s range and underestimated its speed. The report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said the submarine’s commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that\u2028”might have appeared rational to them at the time” but were actually based on inaccurate information. The report cited two previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels in recent years. In all three incidents key decisions on board the submarines were made based on “an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity” the report said. The Stena Superfast VII ferry was just over 200m long and weighed 30,285 tons. Given a closing speed of around 27 knots between the two vessels there was every chance that the ferry would have suffered significant underwater damage had a collision occurred.It is not known if the Royal Navy vessel was an Astute or Trafalgar Class hunter killer boat, or one of the four Vanguard Class nuclear-armed deterrent submarines. There were no nuclear safety issues during the near miss.The report said there is no expectation that the bridge team of a merchant ship should be able to detect or avoid a submerged submarine. The investigation board said it was “extremely fortunate” that Stena Superfast VII’s lookout spotted the submarine’s periscope.The  understands the Royal Navy has accepted in full the recommendations of the report. A thorough safety investigation in 2018 identified the necessary actions to prevent a re-occurrence and these have now been enacted by the Navy and explained to the MAIB. Administrative action was taken against at least one member of the submarine’s crew rather than disciplinary proceedings. The MoD said it would be “inappropriate to comment any further on inidual cases”.The incident is the third in four years involving Royal Navy submarines and civilian vessels.On 15 April 15, 2015, a submarine was deep in the Irish Sea when it snagged the fishing vessel Karen’s trawl wires. Karen was dragged backwards at about seven knots and partially submerged before the trawl wires snapped.On 20 July 20, 2016 the Royal Navy attack submarine, HMS Ambush, collided with the merchant vessel Andreas near Gibraltar.HMS Ambush was at periscope depth and conducting tactical training exercises at the time. A subsequent investigation found the crew were not maintaining a continuous all-round look to reduce the risk of detection in a simulated threat environment. The report stated the key common factor between the latest incident and two previous collisions involving submerged Royal Navy submarines was the absence of a sufficiently accurate plot of surface shipping, a critical factor to ensure sound decision-making.A Royal Navy Spokesperson said: “Ensuring safety at sea is a top priority for the Royal Navy, which is why we welcome this report and have already taken action to tighten our training and procedures.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/27/15/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-arms.jpg","title":"family offices super rich increased wealth ubs report coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.More than 75 per cent of family offices report meeting or exceeding financial targets this year\u0026nbspMore than three in four of the world\u0027s super-rich have increased their family wealth despite the global economic downturn resulting from the pandemic, according to a new report.Of the 121 family offices across 35 countries surveyed by the Swiss bank UBS, 93 of them said they had managed to hit or exceed their financial objectives from January to May this year. The research comes at a time when charities are warning that hundreds of millions of people around the world could be pushed into poverty due to the effects of Covid-19. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe family offices surveyed by UBS currently have a combined wealth of $142.4bn (£113.6bn) and an average portfolio of $1.6bn (£1.28bn) each, which they look after for their ultra-high net worth clients. In a statement released in the report, Josef Stadler, head of UBS\u0027 global family office, wrote that the majority of the offices have performed in line with, or above, targets during one of the most volatile moments in the history of financial markets.Sunak looks to target rich with review of capital gains taxRich countries must act now to prevent further global povertyHow the super rich took over London After writing that family offices could embrace and manage risk like no other investor, Mr Stadler said: It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss. The report found that two-thirds of the family offices had traded up to 15 per cent of their portfolios since March. The UBS study follows reports that many billionaires have increased their wealth during the coronavirus crisis, including Jezz Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and the world\u0027s richest person.According to Bloomberg, Mr Bezos\u0027 wealth has risen by $56.7bn (£45.3bn) this year alone, after Amazon shares jumped due to increased demand for the delivery service.

Jose Maria Vera, interim executive director at Oxfam International, said: The devastating economic fallout of the pandemic is being felt across the globe. But for poor people in poor countries who are already struggling to survive there are almost no safety nets to stop them falling into poverty.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 between April and June - almost two-thirds lower than in the same period last year and the lowest level since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.John Phillips, GMB acting general secretary, said: “Without further Government action, the risk is the cuts to jobs and wages so far will just be the tip of an iceberg that crushes livelihoods and crashes our economy.  “The response from this recession cannot be like the last if we are to recover.  “This country cannot endure another decade of weak growth and cuts to services - we need a Government prepared to make bold investment in jobs, skills and industries.“Business Secretary Alok Sharma said many people are facing a very, very difficult time, following the publication of the latest unemployment figures.I think the best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner, a cautious manner, and get businesses up and running again, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers are said to believe they have made a breakthrough after discovering the jab could provide “double protection” against the virus. Leicester’s mayor has urged the government to lift the local lockdown in 90 per cent of the city, warning a further two-week extension would leave residents “very angry indeed”. His comments come ahead of a meeting involving health secretary Matt Hancock to decide whether the shutdown will continue.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpain honours its Covid-19 victimsMemorial held in tribute to Greater Manchester Covid-19 victimsGovernment to decide on Leicester lockdownHopes for vaccine as Oxford human trials show ‘promising results’\u0026nbspFears are going over a second wave of Covid-19 in Australia after the state of Victoria recorded a daily record rise in infections – despite strict lockdown measures being reimposed on 5 million people in Melbourne.Health officials in Australia’s second-most populous state reported 317 new infections on Thursday – the highest number since the pandemic peaked in the country at the end of March.\u0026nbspThe mayor of Leicester has argued that official data showed that just 10 per cent of the city’s neighbourhoods “have a higher transmission” of coronavirus, after the government said it will review the lockdown.Sir Peter Soulsby\u0026nbspcalled on the government to release the “other 90 per cent of the city” currently under lockdown, and said they “should be allowed to go free with the rest of the country”.\u0026nbspIllegal armed groups are imposing strict Covid-19 quarantines in parts of Colombia where the state has a weak presence, threatening and even killing those who don’t comply, Human Rights Watch has warned.At least nine people have been assassinated in recent months for either refusing to abide by the restrictions or actively opposing them.\u0026nbspItaly bans entry from another three countriesItaly has banned people coming from Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro from entering its territory to prevent the importation of Covid-19 cases from the outside.Health minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement today:\u0026nbspAnyone who has been in these territories in the last 14 days is prohibited from entry and transit in Italy. In the world the epidemic is in its hardest phase.

It will feature interactive and immersive experiences for fans. The website will be modelled as a timeline documenting the history of the boys from their first X Factor audition up until they went on hiatus. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe boyband announced their break in August 2015, five months after member Zayn Malik departed from the group.Fans can also expect the release of a 10-year celebration video. The new video will document highlights from their career including behind-the-scenes footage, as well as an archive of music videos, artwork, and TV performances.Why is Hollywood so obsessed with King Arthur?One Direction spark reunion rumours with social media activityLiam Payne says One Direction have been discussing 10 year anniversaryA reformatted EP featuring the group’s B-sides, rare songs, remixes and live recordings, as well as acoustic tracks, will also be made available to stream online.So far there is no confirmation on whether the five members will reunite for a show to celebrate the landmark anniversary.In May, however, Niall Horan confirmed that the band had “chatted” about a reunion. Horan said on Redknapp’s Home Fixture that “there’s been a bit of talk about it because in July it’s 10 years since the band got together, so everyone’s been waiting to see if anything’s going to happen”.Liam Payne also said, “Obviously, we know it’s a very big anniversary and we definitely want to do something.”Since forming the group in 2010, One Direction has accumulated a huge global fan base. The band has sold more than 200 million records worldwide and generated over 21 billion streams with 3.6 billion of those being in 2019 alone.

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.This is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat this outermost layer are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It’s possible these nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decade“It’s obviously way too early to tell but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries,” Yannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter Deputy Project Scientist at ESA, said in a statement.“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” adds Daniel Müller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter Project Scientist.“Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner Solar System, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of these campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere, said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the SPICE Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six which monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.This includes the Orbiter\u0027s Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA), which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun\u0027s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun which can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shockwaves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to alight. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300 billion to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort from Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa from the United States.It was built by Airbus Defence and Space in the UK, and launched from Nasa\u0027s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the closest planet in the solar system to the SunGravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft.

Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 between April and June - almost two-thirds lower than in the same period last year and the lowest level since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.John Phillips, GMB acting general secretary, said: “Without further Government action, the risk is the cuts to jobs and wages so far will just be the tip of an iceberg that crushes livelihoods and crashes our economy.  “The response from this recession cannot be like the last if we are to recover.  “This country cannot endure another decade of weak growth and cuts to services - we need a Government prepared to make bold investment in jobs, skills and industries.“Business Secretary Alok Sharma said many people are facing a very, very difficult time, following the publication of the latest unemployment figures.I think the best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner, a cautious manner, and get businesses up and running again, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So when will there be a vaccine available  Here is everything we know...Speaking on Peston on ITV on Wednesday night, Matt Hancock said the best-case scenario is for the vaccine to be available this year.But the health secretary added it will more likely be ready in .However,human trials are successful it means that the virus could be available as early as Autumn.Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed that a jab developed by Oxford University began human trials in mid-April - with the top university receiving a £million boost.An Oxford consortium is testing its vaccines in , healthy volunteers, including healthcare workers.The Oxford study is currently tracking about , people, half of whom have been given the real vaccine. But the team plans a later-stage study with another , volunteers for a final answer and expects it to be tested in other countries.Imperial College, meanwhile, is involved in two clinical trials testing a vaccine against Covid-, led by Professor Robin Shattock.Its joined the Oxford-led clinical study, with trials conducted at multiple centres across the UK, including Oxford, Southampton, Bristol and London.Expected to run for the next six months, Imperial will be one of several sites carrying out trials of the vaccine, which is being fast-tracked by £.million of government funding.Oxford scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in their quest for a vaccine after discovering that the jab triggers a response that offers a double defence against the virus.Thereported that phase one of the vaccine has shown that it generates an immune response against the disease.Blood samples taken from a group of volunteers given a dose of the vaccine showed the body produce both antibodies and killer T-cells, a senior source told the .The discovery is promising however the source cautioned that the results, while extremely promising, did not yet prove that the vaccine provides any long-lasting immunity to coronavirus.WHAT’S the UK doing A potential vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford has begun its human trials — the first in Europe.HOW will it be produced The Oxford study has linked up with UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to mass produce the potential vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.WHEN will one be available Most experts reckon by mid- but the Oxford team says researchers will knowtheir jab works by this summer.IS there a drug to treat the coronavirus Early results of a US trial suggest antiviral drug remdesivir cuts the number of days patients take to leave hospital by almost a third.HOW does it work Remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, targets a cell enzyme the virus needs.IS it a game changer Potentially. Dr Anthony Fauci, leading member of the US coronavirus task force, said: “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” But a second trial in China showed no benefit.WHO is looking for a drug cure There are around  clinical trials going on worldwide.About  research groups are pursuing vaccines with nearly a dozen in early stages of human trials or poised to start.Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a vaccine through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Aside from Imperial and Oxford, other researchers in the UK are also making headway in the bid to create a lesaving jab.Experts from both the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University are lending their expertise to Scancell Holdings Plc, which develops immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.Scancell is designing a DNA-based vaccine which will be safely delivered into humans, whose bodies will then produce antibodies and T cells to kill the virus.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well, but it will need support from government agencies.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight Covid-, using genetically modied tobacco plants but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.On April , Britains Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the Government has set up a vaccine task force to accelerate the development of a coronavirus jab.Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a major step toward creating a vaccine.Meanwhile, over in Germany, CureVac are also working on a vaccine, with majority investor and owner of football club Hoffenheim - Dietmar Hopp - revealing that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come."},{"url":null,"title":"leicester lockdown end coronavirus","story":"Now the Government has revealed it intends to review the restrictions to control the coronavirus.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved.

What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is. But the facts on the ground do not match the rhetoric.Anda right-wing politician was suggesting the introduction of a border blocking free movement by citizens of the UK we would never hear the end of it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He immediately spat it out because this is not the type of thing you would expect to find in an esfiha.“When we inspected it, we were horried to discover the piece was the top of a human finger.“My son was ill when he realised what had been in his mouth and that he had nearly swallowed it. He is totally shaken up and is suffering nightmares after this appalling experience.”A team of health and safety experts from the Consumer Protection Institute visited the takeaway within hours and ordered it to close following its apparent failure to meet acceptable hygiene standards and safety conditions.The owner faces substantial fines for inadequate consumer standards along with criminal charges of culpable bodily injury and endangering the health and le of a minor and worker.The evidence has been collected by the Institute of Forensic Medicine and is being examined as part of the criminal proceedings. The teenager’s mum said her son will never eat another meat pastry again.The family has been advised to take legal action and seek compensation against the restaurant for risking the teenager’s health and endangering his mental stability.The injured chef was taken to hospital and has already been discharged with remedial treatment continuing at home.The bakery has been contacted for a response.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He told ministers this week that tens of thousands of Whitehall civil servants could set an example by ing to work. Ministers are hoping to entice people back by encouraging people to believe that public transport is safe to use.

Peak rush hour usage between am and am is still to be advised against, which will remain for essential travel. Instead, Brits will be encouraged to drive, walk and cycle, and only use buses and trains between am and pm, and after pm. The new roadmap would show how staff canto work over the next nine months - including details on using public transport safely.

Errol Grahamaposs daughter-in-law has been granted a two-day judicial review hearing to argue the governmentaposs protection for vulnerable benefit claimants was unlawful. In an important test case, Alison Turner will also ask judges to declare the Work and Pensions Secretary, Therese Coffey, breached the law by failing to properly review its policies after Errolaposs death. If she wins the judicial review, it could have profound implications for the future of Department for Work and Pensions benefit policy for the most vulnerable. A DWP spokesman said: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.” Errol Graham weighed less than five stone when bailfs found his body in June  - eight months after his ESA disabled benefit was stopped for missing an appointment. The -year-old, who had severe mental health dficulties, had just a couple of five-year-old tins of fish in his cupboard. Mr Grahamaposs death was referred to a Serious Case Panel. But its membership is secret and the DWP has refused to sayMs Turner will be allowed to see the findings. Ms Turner said in a statement: “Errol had a long history of serious mental illness which left him severely incapacitated. When the circumstances of his death came to light we had hoped and from what the DWP stated at the inquest, we had expected that the department would review their safeguarding policies and involve us in that review. “But, incredibly, that has not happened.We deserve answers and those answers need to be public for the sake of other families - and other vulnerable benefits claimants who suffer similar mental health dficulties. “No one  should be put at risk in the same way Errol was because adequate safeguarding measures are not in place.” Mr Grahamaposs death sparked fresh calls for an independent inquiry into benefit claimantsapos deaths. The spiral towards losing his benefits began on  August , when he failed to attend a fit-for-work test for his ESA.

We should also move as quickly as possible. The PM said that the case for both Houses staying in place should be considered but that other locations should be in the mix. He stated: However, the review should also consider a possible location outside London. The Government is considering establishing a Government hub in York and it would therefore make sense to consider this as a potential location. The comments came after a new consultation process was launched last month which considered whether MPs and peers would need to vacate the historic building as work is carried out. In the letter to people involved in the review, the PM said: We should also move as quickly as possible, both because of the risks associated with the current state of the building and the need to provide certainty on the way forward and thereby minimise disruption to our business. Before Parliament voted in  to approve the renewal works, which will entail decanting the whole building for at least six years, MPs had pushed rival plans that would have seen only a partial vacating required. This would have forced builders to work around the Commons schedule.The idea has since gained traction again following the coronavirus outbreak.A recent report by the National Audit Officestated that the £ billion cost previously reported for the project was likely to be a median figure, with the final outlay on the Unesco World Heritage Site expected to be higher. Initial estimates put the final bill as high as £ billion, with the builders expected to be in until the s. The body said that a team will assess whether a recommendation made in a report four years ago that all MPs and Lords should leave the Palace of Westminster while the work was carried out is still the best and most cost-effective option.

The compact grills designed to hook over balcony railings in high rise blocks, have been linked to hundreds of blazes and have been slammed as “a staggeringly irresponsible idea by a leading fire brigade boss. They have become popular with those living in flats with little outdoor space as the portable grills are large enough to cook several sausages or kebabs in one go. But figures from the London Fire Brigadeshow it dealt with  balcony fires in the last three years, including one at a block of flats in Deptford, south east London, in May caused by a barbecue being dumped in a plastic bag on the balcony. The blaze damaged the fth floor flat, as well as most of the roof of the building and part of the roof of the adjoining block, the LFB said. Residents of the affected flat escaped uninjured but around  people were evacuated and half were permanently displaced as a result and had to be rehoused by the local housing association. And the LFB revealed firefighters have been called out to an average of four balcony fires a week during the summer. The Brigade’s deputy commissioner Richard Mills wrote to Amazon and other companies that stock or manufacture the products last month and slated the so-called balcony barbies “an accident waiting to happen”. He said: “These balcony barbecues are a staggeringly irresponsible idea and are being marketed carelessly, with hardly any thought as to how dangerous they are. “They are an accident waiting to happen and they are even being advertised with images of wooden balconies and with the suggestion customers have a fire extinguisher nearby. “There are many hazards which can cause balcony fires and they have the potential to be devastating with highly damaging consequences - with a risk to le and the potential for not just you but your neighbours to lose their homes. “We understand people want to enjoy their outside spacethey have it, especially at the moment while we are all spending more time at home, but please don’t think it won’t happen to you, because it can.” Since his call for them to be scrapped, Amazon and gt and gadget website Menkind have withdrawn them from sale. Deputy commissioner Mills said: “We welcome the prompt and crucial action taken by both Menkind and Amazon in response to the concerns we raised. “We advise that people never barbecue on their balconies as balcony fires can be devastating. “Products designed specically for people to barbecue on their balconies are incredibly irresponsible, and we are now asking customers to take action immediately and not to ignore the warning.”Amazon said the products were removed when the “new evidence” came to light. A spokesman added: “Safety is extremely important to Amazon. As soon as the London Fire Brigade raised concerns and new evidence about these particular products we took quick action, removed them from sale and contacted customers. “We value the expertise of the London Fire Brigade and are committed to working closely with them and other relevant authorities on these matters.

The potentially massive maritime disaster came after the crew of the partially submerged sub had underestimated the ferry’s speed and distance. But the Stena Line ship’s quick-thinking officer took “immediate and effective action” to avoid the collision in the Irish Sea, a report has revealed. The crew of the Royal Navy submarine had spotted the Stena Superfast V vessel seven minutes earlier – calculating its distance at , yards. But they turned across its path believing they had time to get clear.A two-year probe found the sub thought it was , yards away when the ferry swerved.It was actually a quarter of that. The sub is part of Britain’s nuclear-powered fleet, although it is not knownit was one of four that carry nuke missiles. The near-miss took place in  but the report into what could have been the UK’s worst sea disaster in years was released only tonight. It was played down by authorities at the time and its severity has only just emerged.It was also revealed it was the third time in four years that a submerged Royal Navy submarine had narrowly missed a collision. Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents, said: “The lookout on board the ferry spotted a submarine’s periscope close ahead. “The Officer of the Watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision.”  He says underestimating the ferry’s speed and position led to “safety-critical decisions being made on inaccurate information”. The report adds that the ferry assessed “an imminent risk of collision [and] the OOW [Officer of the Watch] told the lookout to adopt hand-steering and, at :, ° of port rudder was applied.”And it warns: “This was the third [such] accident or incident in four years, which is a matter of signicant concern.” The Maritime Accident Investigations Branch said the control room’s electronic tactical display “presented a picture of a safer situation than reality.” The roll-on, roll-off ferry operates between Belfast and Cairnryan in Scotland, carrying up to , passengers. It set sail at .am on November  with  passengers and  crew, and was an hour and  minutes into its trip.

The father and daughter lived together in the strange home until , when he passed away.

Upstairs, drawers in the bedroom are still stuff full of clothes, with mice using them as a nesting place for their families.And on the dressing table lies a jewellery box, filled with dust-covered necklaces and rings - never to be worn again. Old family portraits, faded by sunlight and time, hang on the walls of people who havenapost set foot inside the cottage for decades. There is an old record player, now thick with dust, with a record on top, waiting to be played while others are propped up close by.

Ms Turner stated that she did not know when Meghan might make a bid for the White House - but it could be in the not too distant future, reports the Express. America is set to go to the polls in November with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden looking increasingly likely that he will replace incumbent Donald Trump.Ms Turner said: She will run for President, I have no doubt about it. I have no doubt, I think this is all part of the plan. It may not be very soon but it will be. A rather sceptical Jeremy Vine said it was the first time I have ever heard anyone say that. Ms Turner replied: I have it on fairly good authority that she would like to run for President There may be worse Presidents, I would like to see a mixed-race woman in the White House, I would. Mr Vine said: I don’t know whether woke wins elections, that is the problem here. Ms Turner asked: What do you mean by woke  Opinionated   Mr Vine responded: Woke is not aligning with where consensus is now, I suppose that is the thing.The Duchess of Sussex has hit out at the treatment by “those in the corridors of power” in her first speech since quitting her role in the royal family. In a pre-recorded video, Meghan spoke to the Girl Up  Leadership Summit, as part of a session called The Time Is Now. Speaking from her Los Angeles home, Meghan, , said: “I want to share something with you. “It’s that those in the halls and corridors and places of power, from lawmakers and world leaders to executives, all of those people, they depend on you more than you will ever depend on them. “And here’s the thing: they know this. “They know that all of you, at a younger age than any modern comparison, are setting the tone for an equitable humanity. Not figuratively, literally. “This is a humanity that desperately needs you.  “To push it, to push us, forcefully in a more inclusive, more just, and more empathetic direction. “To not only frame the debate, but be in charge of the debate—on racial justice, gender, climate change, mental health and wellbeing, on civic engagement, on public service, on so much more. “That’s the work you’re already out there doing.” Meghan and husband Prince Harry left their royal roles officially in March and now live in a friend’s borrowed £million mansion. In recent weeks they have criticised the Commonwealth’s “uncomfortable past” while Meghan has hit out at her treatment at the hands of the royal family saying she felt “unprotected”.

I literally couldnapost believe the size of the monster jellyfish. Lots of people gathered round to see what the fuss was. There were lots of gasps of disbelief, and some people that were still in the water quickly made their way back on to the beach.I wonderitaposs to do with the very warm weather we have had in the last few weeks, but it looked like something out of a film.Itaposs the first time Iaposve seen jellyfish on the south coast this year, although we did see a small swarm off Tolcarne beach a couple of weeks ago.

The phase  trial in healthy adult volunteers, which began in April, showed the vaccine generated an immune response, with blood samples indicating it stimulated the body to produce both antibodies and killer T-cells, the Dailyreported. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said teams were working towards a best case scenario of a vaccine being made available some time this year, although he conceded it was more likely in . David Carpenter, chairman of the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, which approved the Oxford trial and continues to work with scientists on amendments, told thethat the team were absolutely on track. They can strengthen findings by targeting people in hospitals, healthcare professionals, where the spread is [more] likely to happen, he said. Nobody can put final dates... things might go wrong but the reality is that by working with a big pharma company, that vaccine could be fairly widely available around September and that is the sort of target they are working on. But a source told the newspaper that the results did not yet prove that the Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx nCoV-, provides long-lasting immunity. I can tell you that we now know the Oxford vaccine covers both bases - it produces both a T cell and an antibody response, the source said. Itaposs the combination of these two that will hopefully keep people safe. So far, so good. Itaposs an important moment. But we still have a long way to go.  Speaking on ITVaposs Peston on Wednesday evening, Mr Hancock said: Weaposre all working towards the best case scenario, weaposre all giving AstraZeneca and the team at Oxford, and the Imperial vaccine, every possible support, weaposre working with the other potential vaccines around the world, in America, and Germany, and the Netherlands. Weaposre working with them to ensure thatthey come off first, that weaposll get access to them here. But this is an inexact science and itaposs at risk. He said the most clinically vulnerable, such as the elderly, and healthcare workers would be the first to get the vaccine. Thataposs the principle set out by the independent committee who oversees these things, and on the clinical evidence, he added.

The -year-old, who is part of Britain’s biggest family the Radfords, is expecting her first baby who she is calling Ophelia in September.Sharing the adorable picture on Instagram, Millie wrote: “ weeks until we get to meet Baby I can’t wait to meet you.”Excited grandma-to-be Sue Radford replied saying: “Counting down the weeks till we get to hold you Ophelia we love you so much already.” Millie is preparing for her daughteraposs arrival with a stunning nursery decorated in animal prints, adorable personalised blankets and a stylish white crib where Ophelia will sleep. Generous super-mum Sue reduced the teen to tears when she treated her to a haul of baby items including a brand new pram. But with restrictions in place due the lockdown, Millieaposs pregnancy hasn’t been what she expected. Sharing a pic of her baby bump at  weeks she confessed: “I’m gutted I haven’t had the chance to enjoy this pregnancy like I wanted to because of lockdown. No baby shopping, no listening to babyaposs heartbeat, no sharing this experience with my friends or family.  When Millie announced she was expecting she said she as worried as Sue was  week pregnant with her nd birthday with husband Noel. She said: “My parents have always seen me as the ‘good girl’. They are not strict but I knew that telling them would make it real. “Thankfully, they weren’t disappointed. They were excited.” Sue went on to give birth to Heidie in April which means the tot will become an auntie at the young age of just five months when Ophelia arrives.  Heidie joins her siblings Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, nine, Oscar, eight, Casper, seven, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, Archie, two, Bonnie, one and Millie. Millie said she hopes the tiny age gap means the two girls will be close growing up. She added: “It’s weird that my baby will have an aunt who is only five months older. But it means they’ll hopefully be really close.” The Radford family recently revealed how busy they have been during lockdown by adding a bar, play area and outdoor cinema to their -bedroom home.

The Cambridge kids looked adorable in their little outfits as they were ushered into the church by their mum the Duchess of Cambridge. Unlike Kateaposs wedding to Prince William, the celebration was a private affair but well-wishers and members of the press were outside the church to see Pippa and her husband-to-be James Matthews arrive. While most people loved the excitement of the almost-royal wedding, the big day was a bit too much for some of the younger guests and little George got a tad upset. The Queenaposs great-grandson, usually the master of the polite smile and wave, broke down in tears after the ceremony at St Markaposs Church in Englefield, Berkshire, in . The poor little prince had already had enough as he left the church and was pictured pulling a face as he led the rest of the children scattering confetti in front of Pippa and her new husband. As they made their way over to the cars waiting to whisk them off to the reception, Kate turned to her son and gave him a stern telling off. It included the famous aposthataposs enough nowapos finger point, a universal hand gesture recognised by stressed mothers everywhere, and left George in tears.  According to the Daily Mail, he was in trouble after Kate spotted him purposely stepping on the train of Pippaaposs white lace Giles Deacon wedding dress. The little prince spotted Charlotte doing it, so decided to have a go himself. Oh dear... And the prince wasnapost the only page boy acting up, as one appeared to stick out his tongue and pull a dubious finger gesture - right under Kateaposs nose.  The bridesmaids on the big day were Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French, Avia Horner and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, with Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire, William Ward and Prince George acting as page boys. But allaposs well that ends well, as the young Prince soon appeared to forget his tantrum, and resume smiling sweetly and waving to the media as the cars drove the wedding party to the reception at the Middletonsapos family home. To the princeaposs credit, he played his role perfectly as he arrived at the ceremony, looking angelic as he prepared to walk down the aisle. Adorably dressed in a white shirt, green trousers and long white socks, big brother George even appeared to help his sister Charlotte carry her flower arrangement. But just before the ceremony got started, the Duchess was spotted shushing the children as they got a little too caught up in the buzz of the day.

But when she collected the bed and took it home she found it all broken. And after she contacted the page, they told her they would send a new one, before blocking her on Faceboook. Sophie, who has a two-year-old son, said she messaged the page privately to order the bed in response to their advert. She paid them a deposit of £ by bank transfer and then the other £ on collection two weeks later, on May . But after taking it upstairs at her home in west Hull, she found that the middle bracket needed to put the bed together had been ripped off the bed.

But when I went to message them the next morning they had blocked me. So she said she then got a friend to enquire about a potential order to get a phone number for the business so she could complain via phone on May . She claimed they told her she could not receive a refund but that she would be given a new bed and that they would contact her again before the delivery date because they had to get the bed manufactured again. Despite a series of further unanswered messages to the number from Sophie, she received no further reply. She also notied them in June with a formal letter that she had referred her complaint to Trading Standards, but claims she has still heard nothing back.

Met Officeweather charts show plenty of warm weather and sunny skies between now and the end of the weekend - with the heat peaking on Friday afternoon.Previous forecasts had suggested Brits would have to wait until Saturday for Mediterranean highs, preceded by days of cloud and rain. Meteorologist Clare Nasir said Thursday will be a better day all around than yesterday outside of the northwest of the country, with highs of C and sunshine for many. North and southeast Scotland, northeast England, eastern parts of Wales and central southern England will be the favoured spots for seeing some sunshine. This will help temperatures up into the s, said Ms Nasir. While Friday looks even better, with BBC forecaster Darren Bett describing tomorrow as the peak of the heat for the next few days - with warm air bringing highs of C in London. However, he added that temperatures over the weekend are going to slowly ebb away due to strengthening wind and patchy rain - though Saturday will still see highs of C and Sunday C in the south.  The hot and dry weather wonapost be felt by all, with Ms Nasir warning a bank of rain and wind will arrive across western Scotland this evening, moving down across central Scotland and Northern Ireland. On Friday, she said: Many of us will see some brighter weather - it will feel warmer south of the rain band, with some sunshine coming through. That rain band pushes down towards the far north of England, [and] extends towards northern parts of Wales.  She added: Into the weekend it continues its passage southwards, with some fresher air to arrive in the north and also some sunshine. The Met Officeaposs long-range forecast has warned any sustained heatwaves are unlikely, however, until at least the middle of August. Temperatures sticking around normal with any warmer weather being short-lived, the report says of the period from July  to August .

The mumaposs frantic search for her child ended in heartbreak as she found her child unresponsive inside a vehicle. Police are not filing charges following the July  death in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, according to US reports.According to weather forecasts the state recorded highs of C that day. The case has sparked a stark warning young kids could be more at risk of climbing into hot cars unnoticed this summer as stressed parents juggle work and home-schooling during coronavirus lockdowns.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, visit our liveblog here    Hopkinsville Detective Sergeant Todd DeArmond told local station WHOP News Radio the girlaposs mum told police she began looking for her daughter after noticing her missing.It is believed the girl got inside the vehicle on her own, according to the report. Emergency services took the girl to hospital where she was pronounced dead, a coroner said. No other details on the incident have been released, and the girlaposs identity is not yet known. But according to a United States organisation that works to raise awareness about the dangers of unattended children and vehicles the little girl died after gaining access to a vehicle on her own.  We are currently much lower than the average number of hot car deaths for this time of year due to the pandemic, but we are concerned that the numbers will increase as routines continue to sht and families begin going back to work, Kids AndCars president Janette Fennell said. Nine children have already died in hot cars in the UK this year, according to the organisationaposs data On average around  children die in hot cars in the US by this time of year, the nonprofit said. According to the websiteaposs data,  children nationwide died last year from vehicular heatstroke,  died in , and  lost their lives in . According to the Park Look Lock campaign, many cases of vehicular heatstroke involve children who were unknowingly left in vehicles or forgotten. However the pandemic brought a higher risk of young children getting into trouble climbing into unlocked cars and boots to play, then finding they canapost escape, according to the campaign. A four-year-old boy died of heatstroke in that horrible way in Tomball, Texas just this April, the advocates warned. According to its analysis of past tragedies, children aged two and three are most at risk as they are old enough to clamber into vehicles alone - but lack the ability to get out. The highest risk days for children dying in hot cars are typically Saturday and Sunday when children are at home and not school. However, the campaign warned that Covid- lockdowns measures were seeing more children normally at nursery school being home-schooled.

Donning the face coverings to hide their youthful looks, they make a few adjustments to their clothing and hair and find themselves walking out of the stores with bags of drink, before posting the results on social media. The craze is sweeping the video sharing social media app TikTok as the teens exploit the coronavirus crisis to avoid being asked for ID for the alcohol. Multiple videos show underage drinkers applying white powder to their hair to mimic the greying locks of senior citizens and donning older-style clothes before dropping in on the liquor store. One even decided to don medical gloves to hide her youthful skin on her hands, while the mask covered her young face. Unsurprisingly, several video posts have gone viral, with some in the millions of views. Some describe the videos as apospranksapos but others were quick to point out it was illegal. On TikTok, one -year-old said she used baby powder in her hair and tucked some into a scarf to make her look aposmatronlyapos. Complete with sunglasses and face covering, she managed to buy a bottle of wine without being challenged. Excited, she tells her followers she is shaking.She added thatshe had been challenged to provide ID, she would have said I had forgotten it in the car and left the store. Another viral hit shows a girl of unknown age apply her costume in her bedroom before driving to a shop. Accompanied by pals, she puts on an OAP mask from a costume shop, with fake hair that covers her face.  Her mates film her secretively as she walks through the shop, mimicking the frail gait of an elderly lady. She emerges victorious with a shopping bag packed with tins of booze, as her friends laugh excitedly. While some have crazed the teens for their creativity, others point out it is illegal and that posting the evidence on social media might not be the smartest move.  In the UK, everyone will have to wear face coverings inside a shop nine days from now. The new rules, which come into play on July , are being welcomed by most in the medical community. If you fail to cover your face while visiting a supermarket or High Street shop you may be fined £.

The Solar Orbiter has discovered that mini solar flares called “camp fires” are constantly erupting on its surface. Designed and built in the UK, it is part of a mission to understand how solar flares may trigger electricity blackouts across Europe.Such major Space weather events can disrupt satellites and other infrastructure that mobile phones, transport, GPS signals and the electricity networks rely on.Science Minister Amanda Solloway said: “The Solar Orbiter was eight years in the making, and represents an incredible feat of UK engineering. “Now this spacecraft has helped us make this historic discovery of the ‘campfires’ near the surface of the Sun. “This mission is one of the UK’s most important space ventures for a generation.” The Solar Orbiter was constructed by Airbus in Stevenage and blasted off from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on February . It has been designed to withstand the scorching heat from the Sun that will hit one side, while maintaining freezing temperatures on the other side of the spacecraft as the orbit keeps it in shadow.  The spacecraft will make a close approach to the Sun every five months, and at its closest will only be  million miles away, closer than the planet Mercury. Dr Caroline Harper, head of space science at the UK Space Agency, said scientists were excited by the presence of campfires that are “millions of times smaller than the solar flares”. She said: “The science will allow us to start improving our operational capability to predict the Space weather, just like you predict the weather here on Earth.”  Occasionally the Sun erupts giant amounts of particles which slam into Earth’s magnetic field, generating surges of electrical current. Solar scientists do not have reliable ways to predict such an eruption. The largest one known to hit Earth was the Carrington event in , named after one of the people who observed an intensely bright spot on the Sun where the eruption occurred  The surge caused some telegraph wires to catch fire. A similar event today could cause a continent-wide blackout by destroying giant transformers on the electric grid, which could take years to repair. Satellite services such as communications, navigation and Earth observation supporting wider industrial activities are worth £ billion to the UK economy. The UK provided funding for four of the  scientic instruments on board the European Space Agency mission.  The campfires were captured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager developed by scientists at University College London. Dr David Long, of UCL, said: “No images have been taken of the Sun at such a close distance before and the level of detail they provide is impressive. “They show miniature flares across the surface of the Sun, which look like campfires that are millions of times smaller than the solar flares that we see from Earth.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that.

That was a bit of a blow.“I drove my car down to the pitch to make sure they weren’t on it, but sure enough, they’d already unloaded their horses and their horses were on the pitch.”He added: “The pitch was looking good, we’ve done a lot of work over the last three months on it to try and get it back to a better playing surface.“But the horses have been down the top end of the pitch.“They’re doing the toilet all over the pitch, and they’re eating the grass, chewing it up and walking about.“Slightly later in the evening, there were kids on quad bikes tearing about the campsite and tearing across the pitch, so that’s going to tear up the pitch as well. It’s a bit gutting to be honest.”The team also play at Balmoral Stadium and Lochside Academy, but both are currently closed.Mark added: “The boys are devastated. Depending how much damage that’s going to do to the pitch, it might not be able to be used until next year, by the time you get things repaired and done properly.“We don’t want to put the kids on itit’s a danger to them. It’s going to implicate a lot of costs for the club as well.”In the meantime, Goals Aberdeen has offered to host the team at a discounted rate.Currently, there is only one official Gypsy Traveller site in the Aberdeen area, with space for  permanent pitches and four short term pitches.The site, at Clinterty near the border with Aberdeenshire, has a waiting list.Councillor Alex Nicoll, whose ward contains Aberdeen Gateway, said: “Clearly, the council need to address the problem of where to have for a Traveller site, because the present arrangements are simply not satisfactory.“There are insufficient pitches, as we know, and there is insufficient availability, and as long as that situation continues, we are going to continue to have the problem of Travellers using unauthorised pieces of land and causing problems for local groups that wish to use those areas.“It really is something we need to resolve, and the sooner we manage to do that the better.“The present situation is simply untenable.”The proposed Aberdeen Local Development Plan  identies five development sites that will be expected to make contributions towards the provision of sites for Gypsies and Travellers.That includes on-site provision at Grandhome, the Newhills Expansion and Loirston, for small sites of six pitches.Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Liam Kerr, who has been contacted by Cove Youth over the situation, said: “I’m shocked and appalled to see this occur at Cove Gateway which is a fantastic facility used by a number of football teams in the area.“For months, the players have been waiting patiently for the chance to play football with each other again and to have this taken away from them is shameful.“This situation is extremely disappointing for everyone at a time when it’s vital we encourage youngsters to get back outdoors and play sport as lockdown eases.“I’m confident Muir Group will act as fast as they can to enforce action to allow the teams to train and play on the pitches again.”Muir Group has been contacted for comment.The Evening Express asked Aberdeen City Council about existing Traveller provision in the city and how the authority expects to resolve the situation with only one available site.A spokesman did not respond to those questions, saying only: “We are aware of this matter and we are in discussions with the land owner over further steps.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

unavailability of face masks for his family, as he faced the Covid- lockdown with a pregnant we and his dad in a high-risk category.Hass, who had previously set up a global video business, Volcano City, that saw him work with likes of footballer Neymar and pop superstar Katie Perry, spent  weeks researching the market before launching his #sasMASK brand from home, in the midst of the national lockdown.He had been looking after his four-year-old son Otto as a stay-at-home dad and living with his parents in Colinton, Edinburgh, while his home in Musselburgh was being renovated when lockdown kicked in.Their family business, making greetings cards and gts, based in premises at Newhailes Industrial Estate in Musselburgh, was also closed due to the lockdown restrictions.Hass, a member of Musselburgh Roads Cycling Club, said: ldquoDuring week one of lockdown, we discussed as a familywe needed to wear face masks.ldquoWith my dad in a high-risk category and my we Louise pregnant, we decided we did.ldquoI started shopping for good-quality masks that didnrsquot compromise the medical PPE supply chain. However, this turned out to be much trickier than I had expected.He claimed: ldquoThe face masks available at that time seemed to be distributed by untrustworthy-looking websites, looked to be of poor quality, took weeks ndashnot months ndash to arrive and were extortionately priced.ldquoI realised that I couldnrsquot be the only person facing this problem, so I decided to stop moaning and take action ndash and #sasMASK was born.He explained that the #sasMASK is manufactured in Europe and complies with the latest material and layering guidelines for non-medical-grade face coverings.It has not only been designed to be washable, comfortable and affordable, but also comes in more than  designs, with this range due to double in size in the coming weeks, he added.With the wearing of face masks now compulsory on public transport in Scotland, Screen  Shield is expecting orders to continue to surge as Hass, now back at his home in Musselburgh, fulfils hundreds of orders there until he can open a warehouse.He said: ldquoA fundamental aim of the #sasMASK brand was to create a business model that also benefited charities that support frontline workers and community groups.ldquoIt seemed to me that ndash in a health crisis ndash anyone who was selling masks should be giving back to the community, and especially to those hardest hit.ldquoI set up Screen  Shield so that  per cent of all online sales go to NHS-related charities. But any participating community groups charities influencers buying masks for their network also receive  per cent of the sales value ndash as well as their members also receiving a  per cent discount.ldquoAlong with local and national charities, wersquove had the likes of a cheerleading squad, a group of redundant BA staff, a nursery group and a community centre in Somerset all sign up to

This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah-pubs-reopening---love-even-worst","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of going too slowly she has been accused of going too quickly. She has been accused of simply copying actions taken by Downing Street and she has been accused of taking Scotland on a dferent path from that being pursued in England. She is damnedshe does and she is damnedshe does not. Things though must be pretty desperate for her criticsour First Minister is now attacked for her choice of personal protection. The letter by Dr Edwardssuggesting that for Nicola Sturgeon to wear a tartan face covering is somehow politicising the pandemic is frankly risible. He claims that she aspires to be some sort of \"super heroine\" on a mission to \"save Scotland\". What nonsense.There are two problems for Dr Edwards and his fellow-critics. Firstly he should read the Daily Update figures printed each day on Page  of The Herald. Here he will see the dramatic fall in the number of infections recorded in Scotland over the past weeks added to that the fact that at the time of writing, for the last five days there have been no deaths attributable to the virus. If he casts his eye further down to look at the UK figures. then he will see quite a dferent story. Frankly I find it depressing that the undoubted success achieved thus far by the Scottish Government working with our NHS and care workers in suppressing the virus is never acknowledged by critics such as Dr Edwards.The other problem for such critics is the fact that the steady, thoughtful, progress being charted through this pandemic by the Scottish Government, and so clearly articulated by Nicola Sturgeon, has won the support of the vast majority of Scots.There are more than enough examples of the failings of the UK Government to keep your correspondents busy just now. Your report in the same issue that since January of this year some , children have been admitted to English hospitals suffering from the effects of malnutrition is truly shocking. This scandal has now been followed by details of the new immigration policy for the post-Brexit UK . This will hit hard key Scottish industries such as hospitality, tourism and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a shameful way to treat the large numbers of our migrant care workers on whom we have come to depend, several of whom have lost their lives during this crisis.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I HAVE taken to summarising Guy Stenhouses articles, to save me reading them in future, and perhaps saving him from writing them.His summary of governmental responses to Covid  is: Scottish Government bad, Westminster Government good.He is right that patients were sent from hospital to residential care without Covid testing Business, July , but no one was discharged with symptoms.It was not known at the time that asymptomatic patients would spread the disease so effectively. The lack of a crystal ball was present throughout the UK and patients were discharged from hospitals in England in the same circumstances. Strange that Mr Stenhouse is not also asking for Matt Hancocks head on a plate.Its also unfortunate that Boris Johnsons announcement of compulsory face masks in shops came too late for his article. Otherwise, he could have pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon was again following the Westminster line, and that Boris had preceded her by at least minus  days.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.THE letter from your correspondent L MacGregormust be an attempt to break the world record for the number of exaggerations, deliberate distortions, misrepresentation and downright lies that can be fitted into a single missive. In a way we should perhaps thank her for her summing up of the tissue of mendacity upon which the case for Scottish independence so heavily relies.These range from the insistence on best-case scenariosto utter fantasyvia financial irresponsibilityto that good old favourite the Independence Time Machine , throwing in for good measure the wilful misrepresentation of the devolved fisheries border of  as an oil field border. The rest of the claims in the letter are also rubbish of the same order.The SNP has recently been advised by a tame academic professor of marketing to abandon facts and tell stories instead ndash a lesson learned from Donald Trump and Aaron Banks and his successful Brexit campaign . Its followers are obviously quick learners.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.AFTER the human misery and predictable economic failure of a partitioned East Germany, West Germany paid heavily for the reunication, investing billions into the East. If Scotland ever becomes independent and when it inevitably failsit can expect no such support from England because of the toxic anti-English rhetoric that is the default position of the economic theory-free zone of the nationalists. Broke and desperate, our future will for sure be as a recipient of ldquoaid from Moscow or Beijing. Can I suggest that even Boris Johnson is preferable to Putin or Xi Jinping John Dunlop, Ayr.IN response to Janice MacKay , Scotland was a country long before most of the present countries of Europe and for some centuries before the United States was cobbled together from the ious territories stolen from the inhabitants. Scotland is an inidual country just as England is, and the fact that it is shackled to England by an unfair Treaty of Union does not negate its existence as a nation. When devolution was eventually prised out of Westminster, some small elements of government were restored to Scotland in the hope that this gesture would prevent the natives becoming any more restless. It did not work.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh EH.WE are currently bombarded in the media by the views of experts. My Chambers dictionary defines an expert as one who is skilled in any art or science.In his letter today , Douglas Cowe rightly places the word \"experts\" in inverted commas.After listing the supposed benefits of Scottish independence, L McGregor recommends that I read some of the work of true experts, whatever that means, like Dr Tim Rideout. Dr Rideout speaks, of course, in favour of an independent Scotland. Some \"experts\" lean to the political left, some to the right, some to unionism and some to Scottish nationalism.One can iniably find an \"expert\" who happens to suit ones own political leanings.Experts as defined by Chambers are, after all, human.David Miller, Milngavie.THE figures quoted by your columnist Kirsty Hughesto the effect that  per cent of Scottish voters ndash versus % in England ndash would wish to rejoin the EU seems to show that there has been little change in the disposition of overall electoral views regarding Brexit.However, it must lay to rest one belief held by some Remainers: that the narrow margin of victory for Leave in the referendum was due to the larger dferential turnout of elderly voters.Just over four years have passed since the referendum.

We know therersquos a strong socially conservative streak in Scotland but it cuts across all the parties. In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate. Yes, itrsquos   now, but think about this: therersquos a good chance that every second person in Scotland will look at the executions of Billy Wardlow and Daniel Lewis Lee during a global effort to save lives and think: good, justice has been served, job done.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

From my involvement I can confidently state that the one constant in this situation has been the rapidity by which the volume and quality of data relating to the virus has increased and knowledge and understanding of its impact has informed the need to adapt our response to reflect this.At the outset each country took its own stance relative to the scientic evidence available at the time. Inevitably this stance was clearly informed by politics and we can see the results of that by a comparison, albeit simplistic, between, for example, New Zealand and the United States.The situation in which we now find ourselves across the UK reflects this. At the outset the available science within the UK led the Westminster and the devolved governments to the same starting point. However, as the scientic evidence grew, Westminster chose one path while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took a dferent approach which reflected the same principles as those countries throughout the world who sought to eliminate rather than contain the virus.The evidence now clearly suggests this path has been the more circumspect, while only time will tell whether it proves to be wholly successful. What is clear, however, is that the actions of the devolved governments have been taken based around a structured and strategic response to evidence rather than, as appears to be the case, a series of ill-considered reactions to prevailing political dynamics that seems to characterise the Westminster administration.It has also been the case that far from relying on \"common sense\" as promoted by the politicians, those tasked with ing the athletes to training have been extremely prescriptive about what constitutes good, and safe practice leaving no room for doubt as to what is required. While that may appear to be dictatorial and imposing on an iniduals freedom, in reality one inidual not complying with protocols can have a serious effect on everyone  around them.These are unprecedented times, calling for clarity and effective governance. I leave it to others to determine the degree to which this has been achieved across the UK.Bill Mitchell, Kyle of Lochalsh.I HAVE had asthma all my le, and contrary to what youre told, after five decades it never gets any easier. I also have dficulty wearing the now-mandatory facemask for a prolonged period - after two hours I am struggling to breathe, and am obliged to head home to take it off.But the crux of the matter is none of us should be staying out longer than necessary anyway.

And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might mean they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":null,"title":"science-secrets-face-masks","story":"The Daily MailJanet Street-Porter is sick of hearing about politicians constantly talking about scientic advice.ldquoMembers of the public have been the guinea pigs for the Prime Ministerrsquos steep learning curve, ever since Covid- arrived in our live, she said. ldquoWe know from bitter experience that the catch-phrases trotted out by a member of the government mean very little.ldquoThe latest wheeze is that from Friday next weekwe must wear face masks when entering a shop or face big fines.She said she felt sorry for the highly educated members of the medical profession whose advice the politicians lsquopick throughrsquo and lsquouse the bits that suit them and ignore the ones that donrsquot, depending on how they are doing in the opinion polls.rsquoldquoFace masks are just the latest chapter in the confusion that typies the UKrsquos slow response to a deadly disease, she said. ldquoAt the end of the day, itrsquos up to adults to make their own lestyle choices, and government cannot impose endless dictats ordering us to wipe our bottoms, exercise every day and wear a face mask when buying a bottle of wine or toilet rolls.She pointed out that it was ludicrous to expect shop staff to police customers and the police themselves have better things to do.ldquoCult novel The Dice Man tells of a psychiatrist who makes every decision based on the throw of a dice, she added. ldquoWritten in , itrsquos sold millions of copies all over the world.

As the ferrys range reduced, the submarines officer of the watch altered course to avoid it.However, this turn was towards the ferry and reduced the time available for the submarine to keep out of the ferrys way, said the Marine Accident Investigatgion Branch report.With the sonar contact on a steady bearing, the submarines sonar team initiated a close quarters procedure - the commanding officer was also called to the control room.Based on the picture displayed by the submarines electronic tactical command system, the commanding officer intervened to cancel the close quarters move and ordered that the submarine remain at periscope depth rather than go deep to its safe depth.At about the same time, Stena Superfast VIIs lookout spotted a submarine periscope close on the port bow, and alerted the officer of the watch, who took immediate action to avoid collision.After taking avoiding action, the ferrys closest point of approach with the submarine was about  yards, which was unsafe, said the MAIB.However, the submarines commanding officer believed the passing distance to be about  yards, or four times the actual range.ldquoThis incident happened because the submarinersquos control room team overestimated the ferryrsquos range and underestimated its speed. This combination meant that the submarinersquos commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that might have appeared rational to them at the time but were actually based on inaccurate information, said the MAIB.ldquoTwo previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels show a similarity in that key decisions on board the submarines were made based on an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity. The Royal Navy has taken a series of actions in response to this incident, and previous similar accidents.As a result, the report made a safety recommendation to the Royal Navy to undertake an independent review of its actions taken to ensure that such actions have been effective in reducing the risk of collision between ed submarines and surface vessels.Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents said: ldquoThe officer of the watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision with a submerged submarine. The incident happened because the submarinersquos control room team had underestimated the ferryrsquos speed and overestimated its range, resulting in safety-critical decisions being made based on inaccurate information.ldquoAlthough there was no collision, this was the third accident or incident between a ed Royal Navy submarine and a surface vessel in four years, which is a matter of signicant concern.

For the audience, this mix of quizzical admiration and a sense of mounting calamity mean itrsquos impossible to look away.However, as an audience, the Scottish public today finds itself at the interval ndash kept on tenterhooks with the lead character, the SNP, poised precisely midway between absolute victory and complete defeat.In a Western world where trust in politics is supposedly dead, the SNP defies the new norm. After a shaky start to handling Covid ndash which many commentators, myself included, rightly gave Nicola Sturgeon a hard time for ndash the Scottish Government broke out of effective lockstep with the shambolic UK administration. As Boris Johnsonrsquos government staggered from one insulting, dangerous absurdity to another, Sturgeon projected calm and honesty ndash at the very least she was able to convincingly present herself as a person voters can trust.If looked at from the perspective of history, therersquos certainly an academic argument to be had, weighing the dferences between how Edinburgh and London faired over the unfolding course of the pandemic. Some will say that in terms of hard policy therersquos been little substantial dference in the actions of the two governments, and that when it comes to the numbers of fatalities therersquos really not a lot statistically between the UK and Scotland. However, that perspective is increasingly more dficult to accept with each passing day as the dferences between the two countries and their approach to Covid become more starkly defined.The harsh truth, however, is that policy nuance and the fine detail of statistics donrsquot really matter that much in political terms. What matters is: are you a convincing and trusted leader  When it comes to Johnson the answer is a screaming No with Sturgeon itrsquos a resounding Yes.

That big tent has been up so long that punters inside are starting to turn on each other.Then therersquos the perception of growing anti-English sentiment. To be fair, the perception is mostly driven by fringe extremists many of whom have nothing to do with the broader Yes movement.

Education Recovery Group which comprises local authorities, parent representatives and teachersrsquo organisations and trades unions, has been developing plans for how to open schools safely for everyone.ldquoWe are considering this advice as we develop comprehensive guidance which will give confidence to our school communities that the safety and wellbeing of children, young people and staff is ensured as we welcome them back.ldquoEnsuring the highest quality education for our young people, in a safe environment, must be a priority for us all and I know that everyone is committed to make sure that childrens education is not adversely affected in the longer term.Tory MSP Jamie Greene said:ldquoPrior to the pandemic, the SNP government had completely failed to reduce the attainment gap and it is clear that vulnerable pupils have suffered the most during the crisis.ldquoSerious thought must now be put into how schools can help these children bridge that widening gap so they are not permanently left behind.ldquoProgrammes focused on deprived children must be given priority, but the SNP government must increase teacher numbers, something they have also totally failed to do.ldquoSchool transport also continues to be a hugely problematic area, especially in rural areas.ldquoWith many services still cancelled and local authority funds depleted, John Swinney must put his money where his mouth is and ensure councils canbus services to pre-pandemic levels.ldquoWith only a few short weeks before school starts, the SNP government is going to have to move quickly to ensure schools have what they needthis promise is going to be delivered.ldquo"},{"url":null,"title":"russia-report-meddling-published-within-week","story":"Members of the Inteeligence and Security Committee

Governments announcement today is an attempt to deflect from the contents of the full report have been dismissed as \"nonsense\" by the Prime Ministers spokesman.The documents, leaked from the

When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.\"Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.\"He added that there was a criminal probe ongoing into the \"illicit acquisition\" of the documents, and so \"it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.\"He continued: \"The Government reserves the right to respond with appropriate measures in the future.\"The UK will continue to call out and respond to malign activity, including any attempts to interfere in our democratic processes, alongside our international partners.\"We fully support the recent action taken by our German partners who exposed Russian responsibility for the hack of their Parliament in  as well as their intention to act against those responsible under the cyber sanctions regime.\"The UK Government laid the statutory instrument for our own cyber sanctions regime on  June.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmNo physical distancing is required between children and young people in primary and secondary schools so long as infection rates of COVID- remain low, according to a Scottish Government education recovery group.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Apology to Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney. pic WvKrznenzimdash Simon ByrneJuly , Mr Byrne, who sent separate letters to the men on Thursday, acknowledged that Durham Constabulary was acting on the PSNIrsquos behalf.In the letter to Mr Birney, he wrote: ldquoI am writing to you on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to place on record my unreserved apology to you and your family for the distress and upset caused by the execution of search warrants at your home and business premises on  August .ldquoWhilst the searches were planned and conducted at the direction of officers from Durham Constabulary, those officers were acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in an external capacity and I fully accept the ruling of the Lord Chief Justices that the search warrants were unlawful.ldquoI can assure you that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will be reviewing all of the findings of the judgment to ensure that all appropriate learning is taken.ldquoI have already notied your legal representatives that I am keen to resolve all outstanding matters through a process of mediation in order to bring this matter to a conclusion.Last year judges ruled search warrants used by police had been ldquoinappropriate.This resulted in the criminal probe into the journalists being discontinued.Last Friday, a  of judges sitting in the Court of Appeal ruled the conduct of the hearing to obtain the search warrant fell ldquowoefully short of the standard required to ensure that the hearing was fair.The Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan told the court that the journalists had at all times acted as investigative reporters adhering to their professional code.ldquoWe see no overriding requirement in the public interest which could have justied an interference with the protection of journalistic sources in this case, he said. vw,vw,px, px\"The journalists had called for an apology after the Court of Appeal quashed a search warrant used to raid their homes and offices in  Mr McCaffrey welcomed the apology.ldquoI welcome this unreserved apology from Mr Byrne on behalf of the PSNI.ldquoItrsquos unfortunate that it has taken the PSNI  days to do the right thing and finally apologise since they raided our homes at am on August  .ldquoThe chief constable says the PSNI will look at what lessons need to be learned. I sincerely hope it does. I think itrsquos obvious that this was a lesson on how not to do policing in a democratic society. This was a deliberate and direct attack on press freedom.ldquoOn the morning of our arrest, the police publicly accused us of having put peoplersquos lives at risk. This was an outrageous slur on our personal and professional reputations. The Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan made it clear in his judgment that this was completely untrue and without foundation.ldquoWe have had to live for the last two years with that highly damaging slur hanging over our heads. Who in the PSNI is going to be held to account ldquoThe court found that there was indeed unlawful and illegal actions in this case, but it wasnrsquot by Trevor Birney or myself. It was by the PSNI and Durham Constabulary.Mr McCaffrey said senior police officers involved in the operation would not be held to account.ldquoWho is going to be held to account for the hundreds of thousands of pounds that was wasted in this case  Where is the accountability  he asked.Mr Birneyrsquos solicitor Niall Murphy said there remained serious outstanding issues to address, including the PSNI retention of data seized.ldquoMr Birney welcomes this morningrsquos unreserved apology, he said.ldquoHe is however conscious that actions speak louder than words and look forward to the words being met with decisive reparative action in the upcoming mediation between the parties, a matter which the Chief Constable personally referenced in the apology.ldquoThere remains serious issues to be addressed in relation to the PSNIrsquos illegal retention of massive swathes of Mr Birneyrsquos data, his unlawful arrest, wrongful detention and the impact it has had on his business.ldquoHe is determined that the PSNI and Durham officers who instigated and overseen his unlawful arrest and detention are held to account.ldquoIn meantime, he looks forward positively to the mediation to hopefully conclude this sorry episode in the days ahead.Mr McCaffrey added: ldquoUnfortunately, even though the court found that the PSNI unlawfully obtained our personal data, they still refuse to delete the confidential material belonging to us which they still retain.ldquoThey say they want to hold on to this material, even though it was obtained illegally, for  years. Why is that ldquoThis isnrsquot North Korea, this is supposed to be the north of Ireland .ldquoWhat rights and protections does an inidual havethe PSNI is allowed to retain unlawfully obtained material for a decade ldquoWhile I welcome the chief constablersquos apology, I feel this sorry chapter in bad policing cannot be properly resolved until this issue of data protection is dealt with fully.ldquoThe police had a job to do, to catch the Loughinisland killers, today I hope they now finally get around to doing this.copy -.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Providing play parks do not get excessively busy and that the guidance is adhered to the level of risk should be low.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Officers have been working with PlayBoard NI to develop guidance for parents to enable facilities to reopen.Risk assessments have been carried out in accordance with Health  Safety Executive recommendations and research conducted by the UK Play Policy Forum into the impact of Covid- and children’s play.A range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of infection have been agreed and parents and children visiting play parks are asked to adhere to the following guidance:Closed Play ParksIf the play park you wish to use has not yet been officially reopened, please do no attempt to use or access the equipment, and we will get the play park opened as soon as possible.Secured equipmentIn some cases, damaged or broken pieces of play equipment may have been secured to prevent use. If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.

Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires. Responsibilities in  policy areas - including animal welfare, public procurement rules and environmental regulations - will now go to one or more of the devolved administrations.The way the Government is handling theof powers from Brussels has already provoked a row with Nicola Sturgeon#s administration in Scotland after it was revealed that Whitehall will assume control of the state aid regime. The proposed changes - set out in a white paper being published today for consultation - will see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in . As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK the Government has drawn up plans for the internal market to ensure seamless trade between the home nations. At the heart of the plans are the principles of mutual recognition - so regulations in one part of the UK are recognised in all the other nations - and non-discrimination, providing a level playing field for companies across the UK. Officials said that without these actions a Welsh lamb producer could end up unable to sell their meat in Scotland, or Scotch Whisky producers could lose access to supply from English barley farmers. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: This plan is vital to protect jobs and livelihoods across all four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland exports more to the rest of the UK than to all of the EU combined - nearly % of Northern Ireland#s total external trade is with Scotland, Wales and England.We will be enshrining in law the UK Government#s guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses will benefit from unfettered access to the whole UK market. And we will implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way which safeguards the effective working of the UK#s internal market.Making sure that seamless domestic trade can continue will support our economic recovery, provide certainty for businesses and create more opportunities for investment across Northern Ireland.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’NeillCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I find it so relaxing and the whole day can pass in a complete blur because I am so absorbed in their little world.These are very precious times when we can all be together and share the fun and noise.The birth of these two sets of twins to her two daughters factored in Marie#s decision to step down from her role as principal of St Mary#s - a post she has held for the past  years.She added: I would probably have been thinking about retirement because I have spent a total of  years teaching in St Mary#s and  as principal but certainly the arrival of the four grandchildren was a factor.

Trying to give comfort and help to folk in trouble. And again, it#s people from all backgrounds and faiths who come to me. Everybody#s problems are dferent but their needs for comfort, help, discernment and guidance are all equal.The MP adds that he has been given a practical day-to-day insight into the faith by his Catholic constituents.Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought Ian PaisleyWhat strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he insists. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.Describing himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn, Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian PaisleyJust in the last six months, I#ve received over  letters and emails from constituents who are Roman Catholic offering support on this one issue. That cannot be overvalued.He goes on to say that this is in sharp contrast to those who take the same stance in his own faith.As an evangelical Protestant I get tired by the embarrassment some of my faith have in declaring pro-le views, explains Mr Paisley, They say to me: #Yes, Ian, you might think that but you can no longer say it#, or #I agree with you, but we#ve just got to leave it with the Lord and realise we can#t do anything about it#.Frankly, that lack of faith appals me. Maybe it#s because I was brought up by a man of action that I just won#t let go. But I think it#s also the fact that my Roman Catholic constituents want a champion, even when the odds are stacked so decisively against us all on this issue.Stressing that he admires that loyalty and determined spirit, he also singles out anti-abortion campaigner, Bernie Smyth, who heads up Precious Le.She very happily signed my Westminster nomination on the basis of my pro-le credentials. I was moved by the fact that she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast, said the MP.Northern Ireland is a small place. That sort of public declaration doesn#t go unnoticed. The local parish priest also wrote to me before the last election. He told me he was openly urging anyone who would listen to him to support me because of these credentials. Then, in a practical way, the community put their money where their mouth is, sending me members to join my campaign team to put literature through doors and talk to constituents about the matter.That reminded me of why I admire my Roman Catholic friends. I am so grateful to them for sharing the same values about the right to le for the most vulnerable.The  piece can be read online at www.catholicheraldBelfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’NeillCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While our international visitor numbers will be severely restricted this year there are already visitors coming to the city from all over Ireland and I am pleased they will get the chance to experience theGuildhalland Tower Museum again. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media. It’s totally wrong and shouldn’t be happening. There is a duty on us all to tackle racism and discrimination of any form in our communities and workplaces by challenging negative comments and behaviour.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As of July, they are full-time employees of the Club and they’ll be getting paid to play the sport they love, commentedAcademy Manager, Ricky Martin. “This will also provide them with an opportunity where they can spend more contact time with the Academy, as they will now be undertaking daily training and educational programmes. googletag.cmd.push “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players’ parents for their dedicated support in their sons development at the Academy, which has meant several trips every week for them to training and matches.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey, which was launched last week, is seeking the views of the public and user groups to help Council plan and understand their requirements when they reopen. By participating in the survey the public will help Council identy the issues that matter to users of its leisure centre and sports facilities. All completed surveys will be entered into a draw with a chance of winning a one month All Inclusive package once the leisure facilities are up and running again. googletag.cmd.push The deadline for completing the survey has been extended to run over the weekend until Monday next.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council.

He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation.

Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

I sincerely hope it does. I think itrsquos obvious that this was a lesson on how not to do policing in a democratic society. This was a deliberate and direct attack on press freedom.ldquoOn the morning of our arrest, the police publicly accused us of having put peoplersquos lives at risk. This was an outrageous slur on our personal and professional reputations.

Why is that ldquoThis isnrsquot North Korea, this is supposed to be the north of Ireland .ldquoWhat rights and protections does an inidual havethe PSNI is allowed to retain unlawfully obtained material for a decade ldquoWhile I welcome the chief constablersquos apology, I feel this sorry chapter in bad policing cannot be properly resolved until this issue of data protection is dealt with fully.ldquoThe police had a job to do, to catch the Loughinisland killers, today I hope they now finally get around to doing this..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PSNI chief apologises to journalists for  udistress and upset u of searches article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today’s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.“I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.“I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety.”Roger Gardiner, Orange grand secretary for Co Armagh, welcomed the PSNI acknowledgement of the efforts made to keep within the guidelines.“We did not expect anything dferent,” he said. “The only real events held by the Orange on Monday were really just a few members laying wreaths at war memorials across the Province. In Co Armagh we held a small outdoor event with less than  members who were all socially distanced.”The Co Armagh event took place at the Museum of Orange Heritage, Sloan’s House, Loughgall, on Monday afternoon.TUV leader Jim Allister also praised the handling of the Twelfth.“Many eyes were on the unionist community on Monday, ready to grasp any real or perceived breach of the regulations,” he said.“The reality is that they were left scrabbling around desperate to find something to complain about as the vast, vast majority heeded the Orange advice to have a Twelfth at home and celebrate responsibly.“The institution has provided tremendous leadership on this and I am delighted that the unionist community has responded so well. “Cancelling what is unquestionably one of the largest cultural events in Europe and foregoing generations of tradition was a big sacrice which deserves much wider recognition than it has received to date and stands in stark contrast to the actions of others in recent days. “While Stormont can no longer even give press conferences about the pandemic because the joint head of government blatantly broke her own guidance to honour a terrorist, there is no need for any Orange leaders to go into hiding.
