[{"url":null,"title":"Free speech legal supremacy Dominic Raab unveils plan stop democratic debate","story":"Share this article Harry Potter author JK Rowling and other public figures have been vilified for voicing concerns over an erosion of women’s rights by the transgender lobby, for example.Only this week, the creator of comedy series Father Ted Graham Linehan declared that he had been ‘thoroughly cancelled’ and that trans activists had cost him his family and his marriage. Recent years have seen cancel culture extend across society, with growing numbers attacked in public life, on university campuses and on social media for expressing their views.The author Jacqueline Wilson recently compared ‘scary’ cancel culture to ‘walking a tightrope’.Yesterday, Vladimir Putin tried to use the issue to score political points, suggesting the West was trying to ‘cancel’ Russia in the same way some have with JK Rowling.Mr Raab told the Mail that under plans being drawn up for the Bill of Rights, there would be only very limited restrictions placed on the new over-arching protections on free speech.He said it would be given a ‘different status in the pecking order of rights’, with checks to stop people abusing it to promote terrorism.Although the main impact of this will be on legal disputes, ministers believe that placing such a heavy emphasis on free speech is likely to have an effect beyond the courts and could help iniduals trying to push back against cancel culture.Mr Raab said: ‘We will still be clamping down on those who try and use either media or free speech to incite violence, to radicalise terrorists, or to threaten children. All of those safeguards will be in place.‘But we’ve got to be able to strengthen free speech, the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms, and stop it being whittled away surreptitiously, sometimes without us really being conscious of it.‘So it will have a different status in the pecking order of rights and I think that will go a long way to protecting this country’s freedom of speech and our history, which has always very strongly protected freedom of speech.’The Human Rights Act was introduced by Tony Blair’s Labour government 20 years ago, and Tory ministers believe it is ripe for reform. "},{"url":null,"title":"Duchess Cambridge looks world away afternoons wet regatta dazzles gown","story":"Dazzle like the Duchess in a gown by Phillipa LepleyTake a closer look here!We\u0026#39ve loved poring over the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s outfits throughout the Royals eight-day tour of the Caribbean.

At the moment it could be England, India or, if one of those two lose today, West Indies. Speaking of Nasser...It’s been a topsy-turvy campaign by England. They were gaping down the barrel of an early World Cup Exit after three defeats at the start of the tournament, ever since then it’s been pressure on - effectively playing elimination cricket in every match since.  Heather Knight will be desperately hoping that her side’s 2022 World Cup journey in New Zealand continues to go the way of the tortoise and the hare. That their ugly duckling early performances of dropped catches and wayward bowling continue to transform into something swan-like as the competition reaches the sharp end. Lose against Bangladesh today though and it will be Goodnight, Moon.  The signs are promising, some of those who had been having a ‘quieter’ time of it have stepped up. Danni Wyatt was in the runs and Katherine Brunt the wickets in the defeat of Pakistan. Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone, Nat Sciver and Sophia Dunkley have all performed consistently, so to the skipper herself.  “Everyone is peaking at the right time going into this game and then hopefully the semi-finals… it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish,” declared opener Tammy Beaumont in the run up to today’s match at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.  They won’t be taking Bangladesh lightly. Nigar Sultana’s side have beaten Pakistan and pushed both West Indies and India close. They nearly pulled off the shock of the tournament at a blustery Basin Reserve just a couple of days ago, reducing the unbeaten Aussies to 70-5 chasing a tricksy target of 135. If they’d been more proactive with the bat earlier on the piece then they could have pulled off a spectacular upset. They have a spin contingent that could damage England, especially with all the pressure on pale blue shoulders. I predict a bum-squeaker.  Play starts at 10pm GMT11 AM local time.

Illustration: Michael VineyThe little corpse at the edge of the path was the merest scrap of fur with a squiggle of a tail. To come upon it at the back end of winter was no great surprise. Ireland’s smallest mammal, the pygmy shrew, has a frantic, insect-munching lifestyle that rarely lasts much longer than 13 months.Compare that with the common pipistrelle, the tiny bat of so many Irish roof spaces. Its body size, at the heart of those flickering wings, is much the same as the shrew – it will, as one scientist friend put it, “fit on the end of your thumb”. Its feeding schedule, too, can be hectic: as much as 3,500 insects in one night. But the pipistrelle may live as long as 15 years.The extreme longevity of bats seems to counter the rule that bigger animals live longer. Of the 19 mammals that live longer than humans, all but one are bats. This has led one Irish geneticist to a line of research that now has a keen global following.Deep in the DNA that gives bats their longevity, hopes Prof Emma Teeling of Trinity College Dublin, “may lie the secret of everlasting youth”.In 2012, this conclusion startled a 2,000-strong Dublin audience at a TED Talk about the evolutionary characteristics of bats. Since then, in research that warranted the cover of Nature, she and the team at her Trinity “Bat Lab” have been exploring the bat genome that gives them their “unique and peculiar adaptations”.Forty-two yearsA key species for the research, with blood sampled at roosts in a village in Brittany, has been the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis. It lives as long as 37 years. Another species, Brandt’s bat, a vagrant visitor to Ireland, sets the record at 42 years.With more than 1,400 species identified so far, bats make up a fifth of the world’s mammals. Their consumption of flying insects (in annual thousands of tonnes) and pollination of many tropical fruits make them vital to the planet’s ecosystems.Of possibly huge importance to humans, bat DNA gives the animals a unique immune system and longevity. It tolerates viruses toxic to people and other mammals. It may also hold genes secure against blindness and deafness. The chance of insights into such woes of human ageing is the big drive to research.It also makes even more absurd the common human attitudes to bats. Born within a parish or two of Bram Stoker, Teeling forgives the vampire narratives. And the generous flow of fair hair around her shoulders disdains another cultural myth.The nonsense about bats entangled in women’s hair particularly incensed Prof James Fairley, now long retired from NUI Galway to his native Belfast. In the 1980s, as Europe’s zoologists were sounding alarm on the wide decline of bats, Fairley launched a wave of student interest in Ireland’s species and enthusiastic research by a group of young women.ThreatenedAmong them was Dr Kate McAney, later cofounder of Bat Conservation Ireland (BCI) and head of Irish conservation for the UK-based Vincent Wildlife Trust. Her special concern was for the welfare of the threatened lesser horseshoe bat, for whom roosts in caves, old farm buildings and big-house attics of Ireland’s western seaboard have been an important refuge.The hibernating bat in my drawing was hanging from the wall of an old mine shaft on a Connemara hillside, to which McAney had guided me. The lesser horseshoe, now numbering some 13,000 iniduals, leads the nine resident Irish bats described in a new identification guide published by the National Bioersity Data Centre and the BCI.Prepared by Niamh Roche and Andrew Torsney and well-crafted for the pocket, it pictures key features of animals held in the hand and gives sonograms of their calls as recorded on bat detectors.The echolocation calls of night-flying bats are pitched too high for human hearing and have to be tuned in, as to a radio station. The booklet offers downloadable, distinctive sound files for each species and a commentary offers much field experience.The brown bat, for example, is nicknamed the whispering bat and “can usually only be detected within 5m to 8m”, whereas the call of Leisler’s bat “sounds like chi-chi-chi-chop-chop when tuned in at 25Hz”.Yearly trendsWith funding from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, a cross-border Centre for Irish Bat Research studies three rare woodland bats.d BCI volunteers have tracked yearly trends in key species since 2003.All seem to be stable or increasing, despite loss of traditional roosts and hedgerows. Newer threats come from the spread of over-intense LED lighting and wind farm development.The first Irish research into the impact of wind turbines on bat populations, involving years of fieldwork, launched Dr Una Nealon as yet another woman expert in chiropterology."},{"url":null,"title":" checks for non irish entering ni says brandon lewis","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis met under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin. Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"long delays reported by passengers at dublin airport","story":"A spokesman for Dublin Airport apologised for the delays people have been experiencing. File photograph: Alan BetsonLong delays have been reported by people passing through Dublin Airport this weekend with queues of up to an hour forming at security as a reduced number of staff struggle to cope with the volume of passengers.A spokesman for the airport apologised for the delays people have been experiencing and said difficulties in training and recruiting staff in the post-pandemic period were to blame. He said that the logjam was likely to continue at peak times for the foreseeable future. Passengers have been posting images of long queues on social media and expressing frustration at the length of time they have had to wait.

He pointed out the “recruitment, training and background security checks for all staff working at an international airport” take several weeks. “We apologise in advance but queues for security will be experienced at peak hours,” he said. He encouraged passengers anxious to minimise the impact of delays to to check in bags where possible and to carry the minimum amount with them when presenting at security. “We would also encourage all passengers to be at the airport a minimum of two hours before boarding a short haul flight and three hours prior to boarding a long-haul flight,” he continued.According to the spokesman, more than 100 new security staff have been recruited since the start of the year but there have been delays in bringing some of these people into the operation because of the requirement for enhanced background checks for aviation workers that came into effect on January 1st. “This log jam is now easing, and we hope that more new staff can begin working on the frontline in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we appreciate the patience and understanding of our customers as we work to restore customer service levels to 2019 levels.”All told, around 1,000 staff left Dublin Airport under a voluntary severance scheme because of the pandemic, and while there is an ongoing recruitment drive to replace frontline staff in areas such as security and retail, “all companies who operate at airports across Europe are experiencing similar challenges as we approach the start of the busy summer season ahead”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

However, some may be less sanguine if it emerges that the Foreign Secretary’s comparison is the precursor to a climbdown from securing urgent changes to the protocol.Ms Truss sticks to the government line that Article 16 - the mechanism that the UK could trigger to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol - “remains on the table” as an option. But her rhetoric about the importance of harmonious relations with the EU appears a far cry even from Boris Johnson’s remarks just six weeks ago, when he said: “If our friends don’t show the requisite common sense then of course, we will trigger Article 16.” Senior Brexiteer MPs, including at least two members of the Cabinet, have been arguing that the UK must trigger Article 16 in order to break the logjam in talks and fix the problems the agreement is said to be causing to Northern Ireland businesses. Ms Truss still insists “that the Northern Ireland Protocol isn’t working to protect the BelfastGood Friday Agreement” and that the Government’s priority is to protect that deal. But she does not deny having shelved the idea of triggering Article 16 any time soon, because of the need for a united EU front in the face of Russian aggression. Earlier this month, The  revealed that Ms Truss wrote to Mr Johnson about putting Article 16 on hold because of the Ukraine crisis. She asked that the Government instead helped Northern Ireland businesses with an “economic stimulus” package, including tax cuts. Such a move could only take place with the backing of Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor. Amid internal discussions over the issue, Ms Truss will only say of the protocol: “I am working to fix it as a matter of urgency.”Ms Truss, 46, was promoted from her role as international trade secretary last September, replacing Dominic Raab as Foreign Secretary. Within weeks, she said, it was clear that Russia was going to dominate her time in the post. “By December last year, we had a very strong view that he was likely to invade,” she said.The “we” here includes a multitude of Russia experts and intelligence officials who have been working to get the Foreign Secretary up to speed with the Kremlin’s playbook, which some argue has changed very little since the Cold War.Among those who advised Ms Truss as she navigated meetings with Sergei Lavrov, her Russian opposite number, in the run-up to the invasion was Sir Tim Barrow, the Foreign Office’s political director, formerly the UK’s envoy to the EU.Sir Tim joined the Foreign Office in 1986, where he learnt Russian before being posted to Kyiv in 1989 and Moscow the following year. Ms Truss jokingly refers to Sir Tim as a “relic” when she later introduces him at Lancaster House, a 19th century building often used to host foreign dignitaries. Sir Tim, 58, and the Foreign Secretary were both at Lancaster House for an away day for the Foreign Office’s board on Thursday, when Ms Truss sat down for an interview with The   in a lavishly decorated ground floor room overlooking the  garden.“This is one of the many reasons why I think the UK has such an important role to play in this crisis,” Ms Truss said of figures such as Sir Tim.“We do have Russia experts, we do have Ukraine experts and we have people who were around at the end of the Cold War, who were doing things like supporting the Baltic governments in exile. And we’ve seen the playbook again, in Syria, in other conflicts Russia has been involved in, but we also saw it during the Cold War. And some of those techniques that were there then are there now.”As a more junior Cabinet minister under Theresa May, Ms Truss’ kitchen table in her South West Norfolk constituency was the subject of regular Instagram posts documenting family breakfasts and “pizza Thursdays”. She is seen as the Cabinet’s most enthusiastic adopter of social media.Today, her posts are dominated by pictures of the now Foreign Secretary standing behind lecterns and holding talks with world leaders and fellow foreign ministers. Her kitchen table, too, has become a hub of discussions about the finer details of foreign policy.“My elder daughter is actually studying the Cold War, so there are quite a lot of family discussions about what happened then and the parallels to what’s happening now,” said Ms Truss. She has two daughters with her husband Hugh O’Leary, the eldest of whom, Frances, is 16.The Ukraine crisis “is taking up my night and day”, she said, pointing out that it is difficult to switch off after conversations in which her Ukrainian counterpart telephones from Kyiv to press her for more sanctions and weapons.Ms Truss has played a leading role in the campaign for crippling sanctions against Moscow. She is now continuing to push Western countries to end all oil and gas imports from Russia. Along with Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, she has also been working to counter disinformation before it can take hold, setting up the Government Information Cell to dispel Kremlin falsehoods relating to the invasion of Ukraine.She said: “We’ve been exposing the plans to create a false flag around chemical weapons and I think this has been crucial in removing the aspect of surprise from what Putin is doing, and also convincing the international community that Putin is the aggressor.“He’s been unable to create a pretext for his invasion.”Ms Truss also revealed that she has set up a specialist negotiations unit to provide support to Ukraine “when the Russians are serious about negotiations”.She added: “I don’t believe they are serious at present and that’s why I’ve said we need to be tough to get peace. We need to double down on sanctions. We need to double down on the weapons that we’re sending Ukraine. But when there does come a time for negotiations, I want the UK to be a key part of making sure we support Ukraine to get a deal that works.”Ms Truss is convinced that a continuation - and in some cases escalation - of the current tactics being deployed by Ukraine and the West could bring Putin to the negotiating table.“Putin needs to be put under even more pressure”, she said - both “domestically through the economy and Russia being debilitated”, as well as by countries such as the UK continuing to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine.“With the supply of more weaponry to the Ukrainians, I think we could see his attempts to invade stall, she said. Over time, this will bear down on Putin’s ability to succeed and will ensure that he loses in Ukraine.“And at that point, we need to make sure that there isn’t a repeat of the Minsk process - that we actually end up in a situation where there is a genuine ceasefire, there’s a genuine withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, and there are real levers on Russia in the future to stop any future aggression.”The Minsk agreements were designed to secure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country in 2014 and 2015, in a process brokered by Germany and France, then represented by Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel.“We should have been part of those negotiations,” said Ms Truss, who was environment secretary at the time of the talks, when David Cameron’s coalition was in power.“We should have done more to stop Putin in 2014. And we are essentially facing the situation we are in now because - and this is not just Britain - the entire West, the entire free world, didn’t do enough to stop Putin.”Lessons have been learned, she said, adding: “What we know is that Russia signed up to multiple agreements they simply don’t comply with. So there needs to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever.“Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used. That wasn’t used in 2014.”Her remarks about the conditions for lifting the current sanctions appear to sketch out Britain’s blueprint for the “off ramp” that could be offered to Putin to end his invasion. They chime with remarks by Antony Blinken, her US counterpart, who has said that American sanctions against Russia are “not designed to be permanent” and could “go away” if Moscow changes its behaviour.Mr Blinken has said that, for US sanctions to be lifted, there must be a Russian withdrawal that is “in effect, irreversible” - so “Russia won\u0027t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years”. When asked about Joe Biden’s remarks that Nato “would respond” if Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, Ms Truss echoed he White House\u0027s message.“That would represent an escalation of this appalling conflict, she said. We’ve already seen abhorrent acts committed against civilians in Ukraine, but the use of chemical weapons would represent an escalation and there would be a response.”In the final months of Theresa May’s premiership, Ms Truss was seen as constantly “on manoeuvres” and attempting to flaunt her own potential leadership credentials. But as the Prime Minsiter’s position weakened in late 2021 and the first weeks of 2022 amid several scandals, she has shown dogged loyalty towards the Prime Minister. Ms Truss is careful not to criticise Mr Sunak\u0027s Spring Statement. But she does pinpoint “supply-side reforms”, such as tax cuts and deregulation, including an overhaul of childcare, as key to reducing the cost of living.“The Chancellor has committed that taxes are going to be cut, she said. That’s very, very important because ultimately, the way to get the cost of living down in the long-term is supply side reform, and it’s doing what we need to do to generate economic growth. And whether it’s on making childcare more affordable, which I’ve long been a champion of, whether it’s making housing more affordable, that is ultimately what will bring down the cost of living.”She defended Mr Johnson against claims that he likened the Ukrainian resistance against Putin to the UK’s decision to leave the EU. “I was sitting in the audience for that speech and I certainly don’t think that’s what he was doing. He was talking about the British people’s right to exercise their democratic freedom, as part of a general speech about freedom in which he also talked about people’s freedom once they had got the coronavirus vaccine.”Here, she segued into another reminder of the closeness with which Britain is working with the EU on the Western response to Putin’s invasion.“One of the points I would make about this crisis is we have worked very, very closely with the European Union, she said.“The EU are doing a lot of work to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, including sourcing liquid natural gas from the States and I support and applaud those efforts.“Of course, there are some areas with which we have differences with the EU. But fundamentally, we are all democratic nations, we all believe in freedom and the right of people to select their own governments and we are very much united in the fight.”More from NewsAll schools to be open for 32.5 hours weekly by 2023, ministers will announcePrince William suggests he may not succeed the Queen and his father as head of the CommonwealthChinese oil and gas company cancels $500m investment in RussiaKremlin confusion as Moscow contradicts own generals with claim it still wants to take KyivChaos as Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin ‘cannot remain in power’Russian MP accuses Poland of planning to take Kaliningrad back from MoscowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"workers world unite delia smith cooks manifesto new world order","story":"Delia Smith has claimed that the “workers of the world” should be in charge instead of a “few at the top”, as she swaps cookery for politics.The celebrity cook has deviated from her six-decade-long culinary career with a new book on spirituality, You Matter: The Human Solution, and told fans on Saturday that her days presenting food programmes are now behind her.Veering from gastronomy to political philosophy, she has claimed that party politics is at an end and that the “workers” and “people at the coalface” should unite and replace “shoddy” leaders.Addressing fans at an Oxford Literary Festival talk on her new book, Smith said: “The workers of the world should be running the world, not a few t-----s up at the top. The people that are running the world are not the right people.”Taking inspiration from her dealings in business and running Norwich City football club, she has argued for a collective approach to power and politics, where “you don’t have hierarchies and you don’t have leaders in this, that and the other. You have collaboration”.In addition, Smith has also suggested that political parties should be a thing of the past, claiming that party politics is finished” and “we need to have a new politics”.The cook, who in 2015 pledged to support Labour, has argued that this new politics should avoid ideological distinction, saying: “I would like to see our country get rid of ‘Left’, get rid of ‘Right’, and find people who can collaborate together and care about how to make it work.”Smith has argued for a change in You Matter, but told fans in Oxford that she herself is not a “prophet” and “can’t start a political movement”.She did however express the hope that “younger people will start a movement” to bring about change, and that her new book could be a “drop in the ocean” which could help inspire this and “make us all think”.Her new publication explores questions of spirituality and the place of humanity in the universe, taking inspiration from the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the French Jesuit theologian and scientist.Smith acknowledged that her new venture is an “ambitious” departure from most of her previous work – although she has written books on Catholic teachings in the past – but explained that after turning 70 in 2011, her agent told her she could “do whatever you like”.Her book makes no mention of religion, instead aiming at “natural spirituality”, but Smith said she still attends church.While not leaving her faith behind with her new work, the presenter best known for programmes such as How To Cook has confirmed that she will leave cooking shows behind her, and that she does not watch the work of contemporary TV cooks.Smith attended the Oxford Literary Festival with Michael Wynn-Jones, her husband who is also a shareholder in Norwich City. She spoke about the future of the club, which she came to love through her partner’s passion for the team.She said that the “billions” of other clubs made progress difficult for Norwich, but suggested that although no outside financier with similar funds had yet approached her about investing in the club, any investment of this kind would be decided by supporters.More from NewsAll schools to be open for 32.5 hours weekly by 2023, ministers will announcePrince William suggests he may not succeed the Queen and his father as head of the CommonwealthChinese oil and gas company cancels $500m investment in RussiaKremlin confusion as Moscow contradicts own generals with claim it still wants to take KyivChaos as Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin ‘cannot remain in power’Russian MP accuses Poland of planning to take Kaliningrad back from MoscowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10 mini budget graphs expose","story":" mini-Budget graphs that expose just how horrying the cost of living crisis isChancellor Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement had the usual cycle of a glossy sheen giving way to disappointment.

Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in .

Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is. But as we’ve talked about at the moment, there’s a lot going on, there’s a big job to do and I’m fully focused on doing that job and trying to do it as well as I can.” Asked again, with a cricket analogy,he would be interested, he said: “At this point, I’m just trying to stay at the crease and keep in place and not get out.” Asked a third time, this time with a football comparison, he said: “We’re stretching these analogies too far.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRichard HughesBoris JohnsonEnergy billsLiving standardsPrice risesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You can see his point, because they’re like wise Uncle Nigel, who’s a bit dull but always careful with money. “Always turn off lights when you’re not in the room”, says Nigel, “as we should only spend money on items that are essential, such as £billion on a track and trace system that doesn’t track anyone or trace anyone and has to be thrown away as it’s sodding useless.” Or they’re like Mrs Butterworth over the road, who says, “I’ve always been careful with money, dear.

Their estimated worth is over £million, making them richer than the Queen. Sothe Queen comes round, the Sunaks must say, “Oh no, we’ve got that awful woman from the rough estate visiting tonight. Make sure you hide the best crockery”. In one interview after the mini-Budget, the Chancellor claimed his family has noticed the increase in the cost of living. This week he might explain this further, saying: “Last year our weekly marble statue delivery from Ocado cost £,, but when we took our children to buy their marble statues for this school term, they’d gone up by over £! So we’re all suffering together.” When asked for something  he’d noticed had gone up in price, he said “crisps”.It is possible that the Sunak family would notice a p rise in a packet of crispsthey were buying eight million packets of crisps a day to build a ready salted palace. Or they order “truffle and vinegar’” flavour crisps, or “-carat diamond and onion”. Andany taxpayers’ money does go missing because someone hasn’t been careful, the Conservatives will announce: “Never mind, we’ll appoint someone to look into this and we know just the person. “It’s a bloke who goes to the pub with Matt Hancock… he’ll do it for fty million quid.

Adam Cone spent nine months creating a stunning underground bar in his home that hosts family film nights, quiz nights, poker nights, football matches, and even family birthday parties. The -year-old says  per cent of the materials he used were reclaimed and the total project cost him £, which included a double fridge, a beer pump, lighting and some of the other fixtures and fittings that he couldnapost get for free. Adam, an excavator operator, added: It was a wasted space that was full of damp. It wasnapost useful for storage because things would get ruined.  We enjoy having family and friends around at our house so it made sense to make something to host guests but also a clean and cosy place for the family to spend time. Iaposd say the bar has a rustic and cosy atmosphere with a mix of traditional and industrial elements.I used a lot of timber that I got from work, old pallets and items that I found on the Facebook marketplace. All the tiles were free and other bits we used were extremely cheap, such as the door and flooring which we got from Facebook. Other people chipped in to help us out too. My friendaposs dad upholstered the corner seat and my mother in law upholstered the chairs for us. My dad helped with digging out the floor which had to go down nearly two-foot because we needed to gain enough headroom to stand up as Iaposm ft inches.David roped his children and friends into the project who helped carrying materials and doing other work on the transformation. But the dad has always been a DIY enthusiast and reckons his interest has payed of in the final result. The children were there to help too. My son and eldest daughter carried bricks out from the original floor to be recycled into a new patio outside.  And a few friends also helped get the concrete in to make the new concrete slab for the floor. Adam says that he has always been a DIY enthusiast and used his existing skills to complete the project. However, he has also learnt some new techniques such as how to source materials for as little as possible because he admits that he is usually one to just buy without looking at the price.  His frugal approach and DIY ethos means he has saved money and in turn created a space his family can enjoy. The move has saved him and his we money on babysitters as they donapost need to leave their home four outside entertainment. Adam said: The bar has given us a brilliant family room where we have already enjoyed numerous birthday parties, film nights, game nights and family quizzes without even leaving the house.  It also saves on the babysitters because when the children are in bed and asleep, it allows us to continue the night with family and friends knowing that the children are safe. My son, Joseph, had part of his birthday party down there last week and Ruth, my we, had hers in there over Christmas with about  guests down in there at the same time!.

Natalie Newman suffered three miscarriages in all before having two children and completing her own dream family.Then, inspired by a TV drama about a childless couple, she felt an urge to help others experience the joy of becoming parents. And in November, she delivered beautul baby boy Bobby, joyfully passing him over to parents Andy Kenny and Gareth Mole. Natalie said: “When I saw the look on their faces, the sheer joy, I realised I’d done an amazing thing. “It meant the world to me to be able to do this for them, after what I’d been through myself. “We’ve become such good friends, so to know they are now a family because of what I did is heartwarming to see.”What a wonderful story - tell us your thoughts in the comment section  Natalie, , and husband Jack longed for children, but she suffered an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in miscarriage when she was . She lost a second baby at the age of .“Losing any child is devastating, but we never gave up, said Natalie. Then her dreams came true, when she had son Alfie in . “Having Alfie was the most precious thing imaginable for us,” she added. “He’s such a sweet, loving boy – I had never felt so happy.” Natalie, from Bath, Somerset, fell pregnant again in . It was a girl and Alfie helped picked her name – Sophie. They were blissful days. Natalie recalled: “We were so happy, we painted her nursery pink and got everything ready for her arrival. Alfie was so excited to meet his little sister. “The weekend I thought she might arrive, the same point that Alfie came along, I packed my bag, put the car seat in the car and made the pram ready.”  But heartbreak was to come as scans showed Sophie had stopped breathing. Natalie said: “The midwe couldn’t find a heartbeat. That was  weeks, four days into the pregnancy, the exact point when I’d given birth to Alfie. “Nothing prepares you for that moment, your future as a family ripped out of your hands. I was absolutely devastated. Scans showed the baby hadn’t suffered any distress. She simply stopped breathing and died.”Natalie was induced and delivered Sophie on March ,  – a date she will never forget. She said: “Holding her in my hands, tears streaming down my face, I didn’t know how I could carry on, but I swore to Sophie she’d never be forgotten. I posted a photo on Facebook of a pink balloon and a pink rose.I explained what happened, that our baby girl had passed away. That rose became a symbol of Sophie and whenever we want to remind people about her, when we have a family gathering, or it’s her birthday, we get a pink rose.” Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe couple created a memory box with Sophie’s blanket and teddy, her hand and foot prints and a card from a nurse detailing the birth. Natalie added: “Alfie had been distraught and looking through that box helped him take this in. “We closed the door on Sophie’s room and, over the coming weeks, grieved our girl. But we were determined not to give up on our dream of completing the family we’d dreamed of for so long.” That dream became reality when Natalie found out she was pregnant just four months later. And baby Lily was born in March . Natalie said: “She weighed lbs oz, the same as Sophie had weighed, and I just hugged her so tight, thinking after so many years of heartache and pain, our dreams had finally been answered. “Holding Lily in my arms, with Alfie and Jack beside me, I felt so completely blessed.”Another le-changing event was to come – triggered when Natalie and Jack watched TV drama The Nest, starring Joanne Froggatt and Martin Compston as a couple who use a surrogate to carry their child. “It detailed the pain and anguish couples experienced not being able to have children,” said Natalie. “It made me think how wonderful it would be to help make that dream come true for someone .” She and Jack talked things through and decided it was right for the family. Natalie said: “Jack gave me a massive hug and said he’d fully support me, he understood how this would help me heal after losing Sophie and the other two babies.” Marketing manager Jack, , said: “After getting over the surprise, I really liked the idea. It’s such a lovely thing. Natalie is a very selfless, caring and naturally maternal person. “She gets personal satisfaction from caring for others and always puts others before herself.” After joining surrogacy group Missing Pieces on Facebook, Natalie met Andy, , an embroiderer from London, who had suffered two surrogacy miscarriages with his husband Gareth, , a professional dancer. “Instinct told us they would make lovely parents. They were full of le and love, and I knew this felt right,” Natalie said. She formed a firm friendship with Andy and, after several meetings, agreed to be a surrogate. Natalie said: “I told him all about Sophie, how I was doing this for her, and he completely got that.” The embryo – from Andy’s sperm and an egg from Gareth’s sister Rebecca, a mum of two – was implanted in March last year. Natalie’s friendship with Andy and Gareth blossomed. And at five months pregnant – and a healthy baby bump – she, Jack and Alfie attended the couple’s wedding in Bethnal Green, east London. Natalie said: “There were several references in the speeches to me and their baby. To be part of their lives and given so many compliments by their friends and family, couldn’t have been more perfect.” The pregnancy ran smoothly and little Bobby was born last November – after a rapid delivery. Natalie revealed: “My whole labour was  minutes, then a couple of pushes and he was out. “Andy and Gareth had to run to the delivery room – it was like something out of a film. But they got there just as Bobby cried for the first time. “I passed him over to Andy, who held him to his chest so they could have that initial skin-to-skin bonding. He was still attached to me by the umbilical cord, it was such a special moment. To me, it felt like holding a friend’s baby, then passing him back to his parents. He was with who he was always supposed to be with. “I couldn’t sleep that night because I was on top of the world. “Now, when Alfie and I go and open Sophie’s memory box, we tell her about Bobby, about what we did. “I know she’d be so proud. I just feel so incredibly blessed with my own family, but also having helped another couple create their own in her memory. Andy and Gareth send me updates and we have visited Bobby. We have a very special friendship. It took a lot of people to create Bobby – and now there is a lot of love to go around for him.” Overjoyed Andy said: “Natalie is amazing, she gave us the most special thing anyone can give you. “That moment in the delivery room was overwhelming. Our little baby was there and it was love at first sight. “Meeting this little person we’d hoped and prayed for. “I was expecting it all to be more medical, but with the five of us there, holding Bobby, it was actually very calm and special. “He is five months old now and full of smiles and giggles. I can barely put it into words, what Natalie has done for us. We will be forever grateful.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesPregnancyMiscarriageSurrogacySunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Joanne and Ed are urging the public to check their own dog leads after their #ActionArchie drive prompted a Europe-wide withdrawal of the one they bought and two others. The couple have called for an official product recall notice by Pets At Home which which can only happen when triggered by the US firm, Mission Pets. Ed, , from Dunmurry, who was walking Archie at the time of the road accident, said: “Archie was basically my wee son. That’s just how I feel. I don’t have children of my own, he was my wee man, my first dog and the best thing to walk into our home. Joanne and I adored him and we used to joke thatwe had to choose between one of us and the dog, it would be a close run thing. Now he’s gone and our home feels desolate. Our hearts are broken.” Joanne bought the KONG-branded lead from Pets At Home last Saturday.On Sunday the clip opened during a walk, releasing Archie but the couple were able to corral him in a driveway and put the lead back on. The following day while on another walk, the carabiner clip clicked open again but this time Archie stepped into the road before Ed could pull him to safety and the dog was hit by a van. Archie died on the roadside. Ed said: “We checked the lead well before our walk on Monday because it had unexpectedly opened the previous day and it seemed to be working fine. We trusted the KONG brand and we trusted Pets At Home would only sell guaranteed safe leads. But now we know there are no guarantees.  “To witness what happened to Archie in a matter of seconds from being full of le to death, has been an absolute trauma. I saw the whole thing play out, I heard the noise, I keep playing it over in my mind. Iaposm tortured by it. I feel guilty that he was killed while I was with him. Joanne feels guilty that we bought the lead. “We’re just devastated and angry and we want to warn other dog families not to assume as we did, that a trusted brand bought in good faith from a trusted shop cannot fail just when you need it most.” The couple contacted Pets At Home to tell them what happened while using the KONG Rope Dog Lead and were initially offered a refund of £..  Distraught, they turned to BelfastLive for help. Joanne said: “We were sick with shock, we needed to explain what had happened and we wanted to understand how Archie could possibly be dead when we’d spent his whole le making sure he was secure, safe and looked after. “With the help we got through to KONG and then the manufacturer of the lead in the USA, a company called Mission Pets.  “Thankfully they listened to us, they responded quickly and sales of the leads with this particular carabiner clasp were stopped immediately, and they were removed from all of the Pets At Home shops with immediate effect. The three companies now want our lead to do tests on it and try to ensure whatever happened, never happens again. It will go to Mission Pets for full testing. “Sadly though it is just too late for our wee man. We’re bereft, devastated to have lost Archie in this way. He was such a good boy, the heart of our family who was just starting what we’d hoped would be a long and healthy le. He only turned one a week ago. Now he’s dead and all we have left are his ashes in a cask.  “If we had not used that lead,that clip had not failed, we would have him here by our side safe and happy. Instead our home has been consumed by sorrow. It was horrendous for the driver too, he was in tears and he has our every sympathy. We hope heaposs OK. The only lucky thing is that Ed wasnapost hit by a car because he stepped out instinctively to get Archie.  A spokesperson for Pets At Home said: “We were devastated to hear about what happened to Archie and our hearts go out to Ms McPoland and Mr Hughes at this very dficult time. We take safety concerns of this nature very seriously and are removing from sale three Kong products that use this carabiner clip, including the Rope Dog Lead, whilst we work with Kong to understand what happened. We have been in contact with Ms McPoland to offer our condolences and will keep her updated with the outcome of our investigation.

Many people are struggling to get by due to inflation and the rise in prices as they battle to heat their homes and put meals on the table.In the hospitality sector it is also having an impact with costs soaring and in pubs the cost of a pint of bitter has escalated over the past year.Marston’s, one of the biggest breweries in the country, has reportedly said that a pint is likely to break £ for the first time. The company owns six breweries and has more than , pubs and it has said it has had to raise prices due to rising prices including energy. Prices are going to go up between p and p at Marston’s, with the average price in the UK for a pint of beer £., reported The Sun. The cost of beer ies around the country, peaking in London where there is an average of £ and £. in Edinburgh but it is also over £ in many cities including Liverpool and Birmingham. “The price increase is a direct impact of the soaring energy prices and operating costs as being experienced by all businesses and households across the country,” a Marston’s spokesman said, reported The Sun. The Covid pandemic has put pubs under “financial pressure” reportedly said Nik Antona, from the Campaign for Real Ale. She said: “Our pubs have been under signicant financial pressure following two years of lockdowns, restrictions and partial closures, which is feeding these increases. “From rising energy bills and the cost of goods going up, to VAT increases and the end of business rates holidays, pub owners are feeling the squeeze from all sides.” Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been branded out of touch as Brits face the biggest income drop since the s. He was asked by BBC Breakfast which food he noticed was rising in price in the supermarket as inflation looks set to near % this year.When the presenter said for her it was crisps, he laughed, and replied: “It’s probably, I think bread, probably is the thing. The one we buy I’m sure is now about £. and it was about £, from memory.” Asked what kind of bread, he replied: “It’s a Hovis kind of seeded thing. We have a whole range of dferent - we all have dferent breads in my house, a degree of healthiness between my we, myself and my kids.” It comes a day after Iceland’s boss said food bank users are “declining potatoes and root veg because they canapost afford the energy to boil them”.The Budget watchdog said despite Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement cutting some taxes, Brits will face the worst drop in disposable incomes next year since records began nearly  YEARS ago.

The author of Behind the Throne: A Domestic History of the British Royal Household says they would often call him P.P when in private – a shortening, of course, of Prince Philip. And according to Tinniswood, the witty royal was always the Palace staffaposs favourite member of the family.That was backed up by The Crown actor Matt Smith, who, before the royalaposs death last year, told Variety : If you’ve talked to any of the staff, Philip’s the one they all love really. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section I think more than a lot of them, he’s a bit more of a man of the people. The royal protocol hasn’t dogged him in quite the same way his whole le and there’s a sort of rebellion in him and a naughtiness and a cheekiness. I think he’s quite affable and open by all accounts with the staff. They all love him.”The Queen has been given a number of nicknames over the years, including ‘Cabbage’ and ‘Lilibetapos - and ‘Gan-Gan’ by a young Prince George.It comes as another top author has claimed Philip told an aide “we were wrong about her all along” after discovering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had quit the Royal Family. He was spitting blood after learning about the coupleaposs plan to step back and leave the UK behind, it has been said. Christopher Andersen, author of Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, says he went straight to the Queen to express his “anger”. Furious Philip saw red after the couple decided to go public without informing the family first, he states.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stunned the world in January  when they announced they will step back as senior royals and work to become financially independent on Instagram. Get the latest royal news and gossip straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters No other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - were consulted before the bombshell statement as Buckingham Palace spoke of its disappointment. In the book, the aide revealed Philip had no knowledge of the social media  but was “furious, deeply hurt, spitting blood” when he learned of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s joint announcement.According to the aide, Philip shouted “this shows a complete lack of respect” as he told the Queen of his anger.The book also claims both Philip and his son Charles had a warm relationship with Meghan but their view eventually changed. Andersen wrote the senior royals now viewed Meghan as a twenty-first-century Wallis Simpson – the American socialite who married the Duke of Windsor, former King Edward VIII after he abdicated in order to be with her more than  years ago. Philip then confided in one of his closest aides that: “It appears as , we were wrong about her all along.” The Duke of Edinburgh was not the only male royal who was angry by Harry and Meghan’s announcement.

The tot, from Hall Green, Birmingham, was born with a condition meaning bones in his leg werenapost growing properly, and the leg became shorter than it was supposed to. It caused foot and ankle abnormalities and mum Chloe was told he would likely never be able to walk again.So the single mum chose an amputation for her son so he can get a prosthetic leg and learn to walk. Ollie had the operation a month ago and he is now recovering without making much of a fuss. University student Chloe said: This was the first time he saw it - he was a bit shocked. He didnapost really understand why it had happened, he just knew it wasnapost there any more. Then it was straight back to watching TV for him - he wasnapost too bothered. In fact, he was more annoyed that I had to take him to hospital to get a new cast put on than the actual amputation! Ollieaposs condition, called fibular hemimelia, meant his fibula bone was missing and his tibia bone was half the size it should be. It caused his ankle to be twisted and he had toes missing.On February , the little boy went to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital and underwent a six-hour amputation of his right leg. Chloe said: The days leading up to the amputation were the most dficult - it was the anticipation of it. It was a massive relief once it was done. His leg before wasnapost painful but doing it now means he will be able to learn to walk with a prosthetic. He will grow up and wonapost remember a time before the amputation, so it will feel totally normal to him growing up. A month on, Chloe said the healing process is going well - and Ollie saw his stump for the first time after his cast came off on March . He had a cast re-applied after it came loose, but it will be off for good in a couple more weeks time. Soon after, he will be fitted for his first prosthetic leg, and he will begin learning to walk with that.

Britain has baked in highs of C over the last four days and the temperatures could be set to soar again from mid-April. That means egg hunts outside could be on again for millions after last yearaposs glorious Bank Holiday brought sweltering conditions as we tucked into chocolate on Easter Sunday. The British Weather Services claim that some parts of the UK may even enjoy C warmth in just three weeks time. Although the Met Office state it is too soon to know for sure how warm it will be at Easter, things are looking promising - eventhereaposs rain on the way before. Forecaster Stephen Dixon says we may be getting some reward after a soggy start to next month.He told the Mirror : From Tuesday we will start to see the influence of the cold air coming down from the north, it will start to be unsettled again on Wednesday.Going into April weaposre going to see more of that unsettled weather across the UK, thataposs for sure. The warmth wonapost last past this weekend, but itaposs probably not the last weaposve seen of it before summer.  There will be showers, heavy at times, but it will be more dryer in southern areas. Unfortunately we wonapost be getting the warmer weather we have enjoyed this week at the start of next month. However, there is potentially some good news - it will be much more settled by mid-April and the trends we are seeing are more encouraging. We canapost put numbers on it quite yet, but people can draw their own conclusions when we say there could be a , for many, to much more settled weather.  While the Met Office avoided saying how warm Easter could be, Jim Dale - the senior meteorologist at the British Weather Services - said there is a real possibility that some parts of the UK could see temperatures as high as C. “I know March is the start of Spring but I think we’re probably going to get properly into April before we start to see the searing sort of temperatures.” He added: “I wouldn’t be surprised to see °C, °C, °C in the middle of April. “Longer-term, given what’s happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and what’s also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights.  A leading bookmaker has meanwhile has slashed the odds on this summer being the UKaposs hottest on record. Coral now make it - - down from from - - to break records. The weekend sunshine has got Brits dreaming of summer already said Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead. With temperatures rising we have slashed the odds on the UK recording its hottest ever summer in . Early April The first few weeks of April follow a very similar theme all over the UK - itaposs going to be unsettled. There will be showers, some heavy, and the north of England will be the worst hit. The south will be less wet, but there wonapost be too much in the way of sun. Mid-April Things will start to warm up in the second half of April. Thereaposs hope it will be another very warm Easter, with some even predicting it will be hotter than last yearaposs C sizzler. Most of the country can expect warm and sunny spells after a drab start to the month. Late April and early May The Met Office say itaposs dficult to know yet in the sunny burst will last. Temperatures will drop from April  and early forecasts show cloud with C warmth. But, at the moment, it is expected to be a dry end to the month.

Crowds were pictured lounging on beaches in Southsea, Portsmouth, Bournemouth and where.However, the Met Office has warned that conditions are set to change next week, with snow possible as temperatures drop to as low as -C.Todayaposs warm weather is expected to tail off tomorrow with predicted highs of C, although it will still be sunny.  A Met Office spokesman said: Although Monday will still see a good deal of dry and fine weather, increasing cloud will hinder high temperatures. The west will hold onto the warmest of the weather through the day. Coupled with this is the risk of a few showers across some central and southern areas of the UK. By Tuesday a cold air mass will attempt to push into the north of the UK and slowly sink southwards, although the exact way this occurs is still very uncertain.  However this happens, we are likely to see a change to a more unsettled and cooler weather picture from the middle of next week. Showers will be possible for much of the UK, although most frequent in the north and east, some of which are likely to be wintry in nature. Nighttime temperatures in the north could sink to –C in isolated rural areas. It comes after the UK enjoyed almost a week of warm and sunny weather.

On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” UK Weather Forecast This evening: A clear night for many northern and western areas, with patchy rural frost. Breezier across southern England, while increasing amounts of low cloud likely to spread to some eastern and central areas of England, with patchy fog especially on hills. Sunday: Sunny for many northern and western parts, warm by afternoon. Parts of southern and central England and perhaps east Wales, cloudier especially during the morning, leading to a cooler day. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Remaining warm initially, but gradually turning more unsettled with showers and rain. These turning wintry in the north as colder conditions filter southwards.

This will increase to £ a year when the price rises again in OctoberHeating bills can be reduced Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByJames RodgerRegional Content EditorNeil ShawGraeme Murray:,  Mar The worst vampire appliances which drain your energy and bank account have been highlighted as energy bills rise. A host of everyday costs are poised to go through the roof, with bill hikes on the horizon ahead of the Cost of Living Crisis. Utility bills will soar, but there are also rises in National Insurance, Council Tax water bills and other subscription services. Smart meter analyst Loop are now making households aware of eight appliances we use regularly which can drain your bank account.Steve Buckley, head of data science at Loop, told BirminghamLive : “Many people I speak to are really worried about their energy bills right now, and sadly the situation is not set to improve for some time yet.The reality is that the only way we can lower our energy bills right now is to reduce the amount of energy we use and the key to that is measuring our use.  If you measure it, you can control it. If you measure it, you can see the impact of changes you make. “Understanding whether your phantom load is low, medium or high is the first step towards reducing it and can lead to big savings. Our free app connects to your smart meter so you can benchmark against other households and track your usage and use the data to your advantage. You can easily identy the culprits draining your energy and adding pounds to your bills.” Energy-sucking devices, like electric towel rails or underfloor heating, could add a whopping £ a yearon energy bills from next week. This will increase to £ a year when the price rises again in October.  Utility bills are expected to spiral by % and will rise again in October with even more hikes predicted every three months.In his spring statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak hinted there could be more help on the way to pay for rising fuel bills. But Walesonline reports they can be reduced adjusting your thermostat and ensuring you have as much double glazing and insulation as you can.Before going bust last year, energy company Utilita created a guide to how much energy each appliance uses when on standby,Archie Lasseter, sustainability lead at Utilita, told The Sun : “Standby mode is a real energy drainer – some items use the same amount of energy as when they’re switched on. In each home, leaving just one TV on standby can waste up to £ of electricity a year. While £ a year may not seem much - turning a TV off would therefore save you £ month on your electricity bill. Moreyou have additional TVs, and more when the bills go up in April. A games console such as an XBox or Playstation will also use around  watts in standby - or £. a year each when not in use. A laptop will add £. a year to your billyou leave it sitting untouched but plugged in.Your Google Home or Alexa Smart speakers use almost as much power when in standby as when in use - £. a year on your bill for each speaker.A plug-in baby monitor will cost you £. a year when not being usedAnd even a phone charger left plugged in, when not charging, adds p a year to your bill. So overall,you have a couple of smart speakers, a laptop, a games console, more than one TV and a few other devices then you could be spending £ a year - or £ a month - just to leave them not-quite switched off. People with multiple devices, TVs, laptops and consoles will be spending signicantly more.  According to British Gas, up to % of British homesapos energy use could power vampire appliances - thataposs £ of the average energy bill capped at £, a year. Energy expert Rob Bohm says these devices add up to billions of pounds in wasted power every year. Bohm said: Theyaposre electrical appliances, chargers and lights all over your home, devices that suck power from the mains — constantly — even when you think theyaposre switched off.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. One of the employees calls out to the man, who has apparently been spitting on the vehicles for months now, while another chucks the water over him before he cycled off again dripping wet. Kurtulus reportedly doesnapost know what the manaposs issue is but thinks his animosity could possibly be due to him being displeased with how the cars cover up the cycling lane.As reported byLadBible , Kurtulus said: We respect everyone andpeople have a problem, they can always come to us and we will find a solution.Until we know whataposs going on, we canapost take any action. But tackling us in this way is disrespectful and unheard of.  At first, staff had no clue as to why they kept finding saliva on the cars, but after checking CCTV footage, they quickly realised it was the same man spitting on them, over and over again.Kurtulus continued: It is very unfortunate that the cyclist cannot tell us what his problem is. But also that he didnapost stop spitting at our cars. We were fed up with it, so we surprised him with a bucket of water. Waste of water.Do you have a story of revenge to share  We pay for stories.

The woman, from the US, explained her friend invited her and her husband to South Padre Island in Texas and told her specically to bring one of her black dresses for aspecial eventthat would be taking place during the trip.When the woman was packing, she realised she didnapost fit into the black dress anymore so packed a white one instead, thinking the substitute would be close enough to the one her friend suggested. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. But when the day of the event arrived, her friend told her it was actually her wedding day - and was furious that sheaposd decided to wear white.In her post, the woman said: My best friend invited my husband and me to go on vacation with them at South Padre Island. She told me to bring the dress I wore to my last anniversary dinner for the special dinner event she planned during the vacation. I said sure.I also recently gave birth, and that dress is elegant black lace over a nude dress that is very classy but also form-fitting. When I tried it on when packing, I realised it wasn’t as flattering and my boobs had a hard time fitting. So instead, I packed a cute semi-formal white lace dress instead. I figured it was close enough.  I arrived at the event and found out it was a surprise wedding on the beach where she only invited like  guests. She hadn’t told me it was her wedding because of an inside joke, where I kept telling her and her partner to get married and said theyaposd just elope and next thing we know they are married. The woman said she was horried when she realised the mistake she had made, and things went from bad to worse when she was then told she was supposed to act as the maid of honour at the ceremony. She tried to tell her friend to get someone  to fill the role but she refused - and instead accused her of ruining the wedding. The woman added: She was horried, and so was I. I didn’t bring any other dress, plus there was no time to change buy a new dress. Also, surprise! I’m the maid of honour. I offered to either not be the maid of honour, or leave the wedding, but she rathered me not. Later she blamed me for ruining her wedding because I didn’t follow her instructions to wear a specic dress and didn’t tell her about changing my mind. I said I’m sorry her wedding was ruined but it wasn’t my fault and she should have told me it was her wedding, and at the time of packing, I didn’t find it appropriate to get her approval on my outfit. Commenters on the Reddit post admitted they were initially planning to tell the poster she was in the wrong, but after discovering that she didnapost even know thereaposd be a wedding. One person said: You didnapost know. It was close to the same style, I donapost see how you could have known not to wear white simply because someone asked you to wear a dress they liked on you before. While another added: You arenapost a mind reader so how could you know it was going to be a wedding. An apology would be nice.

Although cannabis is illegal for all production and public consumption in Chile, it is legal for private-at-home consumption.Aloaposs sister requested the unique wedding cake ingredient herself after having enjoyed sampling some “magical brownies” and all guests were made fully aware of what had gone into the special layer before tucking in.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Footage which has since clocked up more than  million views on TikTok, shows guests cheering as the new bride and groom slice into the innocent-looking wedding cake.The video then cuts to around  out of the  wedding guests dancing around happily, laughing as the effects of the cannabis took hold. One commenter remarked that they were definitely doing this on my wedding [day]. While another wrote: Ok, I didnapost want to get married, but now Iaposve seen this, and I want to get married, then orced, but I will already have been happy with my magical wedding cake.Alo said: It was good fun. Me and my sister had already tried magical brownies and the effect was very funny, so when she asked to have a bit for her wedding I didnapost think twice. The magic level itself took me two hours and was pretty easy. I just infused it with the butter from the day before and once the brownie set I put it with the other levels with chocolate ganache, and voila. Everyone was made aware of it and after the cake was cut, we made sure it was kept apart from the others and served only to adults. He continued: The funniest reaction was my aunt. I remember her back hurt and two hours after eating cake her pain disappeared and she was up dancing like a teenager. I think cannabis cooking should be normalised a little more, both in culinary and medicinal terms. It has incredible effects on those who might need an alternative, both for physical and mental health.Do you have a wedding-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

Her numerous predictions about world events and the state of humanity have become infamous, including claims she predicted the rise of ISIS and the fall of the Twin Towers.The Irish Mirror also told of her chilling predictions today and how some of them have come true.Specialists have since calculated that  per cent of her prophecies had happened - slightly less than the  per cent claimed by her followers. These are some of her other previous predictions: The Kursk nuclear submarine disaster In  the blind prophetess predicted that in August of , “Kursk will be covered with water and the whole world will weep over it.” Kursk was a Russian sub that Sank in the Barents Sea on August , , killing all aboard.  In  Baba Vanga said: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.” On September , , planes hijacked by Islamic extremists hit the World Trade Center in New York, killing thousands of people. Europe will cease to exist According to Baba Vanga, the continent will cease to exist by , and all that would remain will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of le. Clearly not exactly right, but the UK did vote to leave the EU on June , , creating a lot of turmoil. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would be used by extremists against Europe . Barack Obama will be the last president of the US Baba Vanga had predicted that the th US president would be an African American, but she had also added that he would be the last one. She claimed he would leave office at a time when the country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge ide between the northern and southern states – as was the case during the American Civil War.Baba also appeared to predict that the th president of the United States - who we now know to be Donald Trump - would be faced with a crisis which would “bring the country down”.Her chilling prediction states: “Everyone will put their hopes in him to end it, but the opposite will happen he will bring the country down and conflicts between north and south states will escalate.” Some speculate the references to “north and south” could mean North and South Korea. World War III Baba’s predictions have been revisited after another mystic, who apparently foretold Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to know the exact date World War  will start. Self-proclaimed ‘messenger of God’ Horacio Villegas believes nuclear war will break out on the th anniversary of the visitation of Our Lady of Fatima. The clairvoyant claims to have envisioned Trump would win the US election as far back as . He reportedly predicted the billionaire businessman would become the “illuminati king” who will “bring the world into WW ”. The  Boxing Day Tsunami “Cold regions will become warm ... and volcanoes will awaken. “A huge wave will cover a big coast covered with people and towns, and everything will disappear beneath the water. Everything will melt, just like ice.” China rises According to the prophetess, China will become a world power in . She’s probably out a few years here as China is already an economic and military powerhouse. We’ve also apparently got a change in the Earth’s orbit to look forward to some time before . A golden age A new energy source will be created and global hunger will start to be eradicated between  and . A manned spacecraft to Venus will be launched. From  to  the polar ice caps will melt, causing ocean levels to rise. Cloning of organs Baba Vanga’s predicted that body organs will be cloned by , and that would be the easiest method of treatment. Red and green Between  and  a classless, Communist society will thrive hand in hand with newly-restored nature. Mars attacks! A LOT happens from  to , including a Mars colony becoming a nuclear power and demanding independence from the earth, the establishment of an underwater city and the discovery of something “terrible” during the search for alien le. Some time between  and  we’ll crack time travel. Meanwhile, French guerrillas fight the Muslim authorities in France. The “secrets of the moon” will be unveiled. The end of the world By , everything on Earth will cease to exist. However, humans will be advanced enough to move to a new star system.

Thousands have turned up in Turkey, as well as Finland, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan.Now a senior government official has left Russia - the first one to do so, with speculation that others could follow.The Kremlin confirmed this week that Anatoly Chubais has left the country. Chubais has resigned voluntarily. And it is up to him whether to leave or not, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told the media. Putin has previously dubbed those who have fled scum and traitors and claimed Russian society will spit them out like a gnat. But his harsh words are having little impact - with many high-profile Russians having already left, and others planning to do so.

Mystery remains as to what caused the Boeing  plane to suddenly nose e as it headed from Kunming to Guangzhou killing  passengers and nine crew.It appears to have crashed into remote hillside at around mph and while investigators have found a black box it is uncertaindata can be retrieved from it due to its damaged state. Search teams have been looking through the debris at the crash site for clues as to what happened, but now it seems as though they will need to extend the area. Investigations have been made more dficult by hilly and forested terrain in the Guangxi region while there has also been heavy rain making the land muddy and susceptible to landslides.  Around six miles from the crash site, farmer Huang Jianyi, , said he found a piece of metal while working on a paddy field in the village of Siwang.“I saw a piece of metal. It was white,” said Huang, reported the South China Morning Post, spreading his arms out wide to indicate its large dimensions.It was later found and it raises questions now over whether the plane broke up in the sky.Zheng Xi, head of the Guangxi regional fire and rescue office, reportedly said the piece of suspected wreckage was about . metres long and cm wide.Huang’s son Chen Zhuchang, , reported the sighting of the metal strip to the police. “It was a long white strip that bends when picked up, it had a slight curve, and it wasn’t heavy,” he told the SCMP.  “There was a small area of blue paint at the centre of the strip. When I saw this, my first thought was that it could be aircraft debris.” As recovery crews sted through debris, dozens of relatives of those on board flight MU remained nearby in an anxious wait for further news. One was Qin Haitao who comes from neighbouring Hunan province and his daughter, Shujun, was a passenger on the flight on Monday. Guangzhou-based migrant worker Shujun, , had travelled to Kunming to accompany her mother to see a specialist doctor she had heard was very good. We couldnapost believe it and didnapost dare say anything, for fear that my we would not be able to bear it, Qin said, when describing the moment he heard the news of the crash. Our eyes were full of tears but we dared not weep. In fact, we knew the truth, but we kept it from her for a night, for half a day plus one night.  Qin said he initially received no official confirmation about his daughteraposs situation but on Monday night his brother-in-law went to Guangzhouaposs Baiyun International Airport, where the flight was scheduled to arrive. There, he was shown a list of the passengersapos names, which included Shujunaposs. On Tuesday, Qin, his son and two others drove to Wuzhou and the next day visited the crash site accompanied by staff and volunteers from China Eastern. Itaposs so painful, he said in a broken voice, holding back tears. We have nothing but grief now. We are living in grief every day.Rescue workers have reported finding human remains, pieces of personal belongings of the passengers and debris from the plane.Many family members were burning incense, Qin said, about the visit to the crash site.I prayed and put my daughteraposs name there. It happened to be her birthday that same day...so I said: aposDad came to see you, my child. Happy birthdayapos. After that visit to the site, Qin has largely stayed at his hotel with his son, Shujunaposs elder brother and only sibling. Shujun herself leaves behind a teenage daughter. We donapost have any requests now, Qin said. Our only request is to find my daughteraposs body as soon as possible and bring her home.

The US President blasted Putin as a dictator in a stirring speech at theRoyal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.It comes after years of claims that Putin is desperate to re-establish Russian control over former Soviet Union countries.Biden denounced the despot after speaking to Ukrainian refugees in the Polish capital today.When asked what he thought of Putin after the meeting, the President said: Heaposs a butcher.In his speech outside theRoyal Castle, Biden added: In this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today - never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid. A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a peopleaposs love for liberty.Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refused to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.We will have a dferent future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities. For Godaposs sake, this man cannot remain in power.  The White House later claried that Biden was not discussing regime change in Moscow. Instead he was emphasising that Russia should not be allowed to control its neighbours, a US official said. Biden also addressed the Russian people in his speech today, saying aposyou are not our enemyapos while warning that the Kremlinaposs actions in Ukraine was aposnotof a great nationapos Biden added: Of all people, you the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the s and s, the situation of World War Two, still fresh in the mind of many grandparents in the region.  After sharing accounts of the horrors of World War Two, he added: These are not memories of the past - not any more, itaposs exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now. The US president said Moscowaposs troops have met their match with brave and stf Ukrainian resistance and have strengthened the resolve and unity of both the defending forces and the West. Russia wanted less of a Nato presence on his border but now he has a stronger presence, a larger presence, he said.  Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Mr Biden said , Russians had left their country in a single month in a remarkable brain drain as Mr Putin, who he earlier called a butcher, had strangled democracy.Addressing the thousand-strong audience that included refugees who have fled the war, he told Ukrainians we stand with you - period as he defended the nationaposs president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Putin has the gall to say heaposs denazying Ukraine. Itaposs a lie, itaposs just cynical - he knows that, Mr Biden said. And itaposs also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, heaposs Jewish, his fatheraposs family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity - like all autocrats before him - to believe that might will make right.

Karis Wilson was told her knee- black dress with lace trim over a long-sleeve white turtleneck reminded a female teacher of “lingerie” and made a male student teacher feel awkward, when she wore it to school.The -year-old was sent home and the encounter was so damaging she did notto school until her graduation at the end of the year.Her father Christopher Wilson initially complained about the incident on aFacebooklive video that went viral, with more than , views. He told the Daily Star : She wasnapost wearing it in a sexual manner. She wasnapost wearing it for attention. She normally wears track pants and a hoody. She had a snowboarding accident a month or two ago and couldnapost be active for a while. She had started going to the gym and feeling better about herself. Then one day she decided to wear a dress and feel good about herself, this is how they reacted. “She had lost more than a week of school and then she said ‘dad, I don’t know what to wear to school’. “She elaborated a little bit and said, ‘DadI wear just my track pants and hoodie,I wear something comfortable, am I conforming  “aposIf I wear something I feel pretty in, am I trying to rub it in their face ’”  Karis, a student at NorKam Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada, has now put the incident behind her and started her university education. Her dad told CBC News at the time:was told that it could possibly make the male student teacher feel awkward and it could makefeel awkward since it reminded her of a lingerie outfit. Itaposs actually a very modest outfit when you actually look at it... I think the initial comments were based on the fact that it had lace.” It was said in  that dad Christopher was told the teacher was a little bit old school after complaining to the principal.He said a teacher pulled Karis out of her class and escorted her to the principalaposs office on Tuesday. He claimed the principal later told him that she agreed the outfit was not inappropriate. Karisapos classmates staged a walkout the following day to show their support for her. At the time he added: There was a female who was singled out because what sheaposs wearing could make someone in a position of power over her feel uncomfortable. And the more you think of it, the more you say it, the more you understand that this is absurd.He initially complained about the incident in a live Facebook video that went viral, with more than , views.And now, speaking to the Daily Star in , Christopher said his daughter was confident thatshe could go back in time and change anything, she would do the same thing again.

years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"in columbas footsteps without cuban heels","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA TV series will feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry.

As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreSimon joined the Department of Work and Pensions as a work coach two years ago after  years in sales and marketing in the private sector.

be granted an extra day off work this year at a notional cost of more than £k in recognition of their ‘exceptional response’ during the COVID- pandemic.When members of the full council meet next Thursday, March , they will be recommended to endorse the granting of a ‘well-being day’ as a way of rewarding local authority employees who have been flexible and committed since March , ensuring that essential services continued to be provided.If it is not practical for a staff member to take the day off they will receive a financial reward instead.A report submitted to the committee, from Clair Hepburn, the council’s director of people performance and change, asks members to consider a ‘tangible gesture’ in recognition of staff efforts.It adds: “Options for providing employees with a demonstrable token of recognition are limited by cost and the dficulty in implementing it without disruption to the business.“The issue of additional COVID- payments to some staff groups has been both controversial and isive.“The council has been at pains to emphasise the contributions of all its employees, choosing not to make an articial distinction between front-line and ‘other’, and instead choosing a ‘one council’ approach.“In addition, at a time when services are increasingly under financial pressure, and with very considerable uncertainty about the medium term financial outlook, recognition that has a direct financial cost to the council, such as a payment or a gt, may be viewed negatively by some, including the public.“The sustained extent of the pandemic has had an impact on the well-being and resilience of employees across the council.“In recognition of that, the reward of an additional day’s well-being leave would enable iniduals to take the day at an appropriate time during  to meet their own personal well-being needs without disruption to service provision.”.removeThe financial implications of granting an additional well-being day to all staff notionally equates to £,.This is based on lost productivity for all staff on the assumption they will be taking a day off work where they have been required to work.For some services there will be further additional costs for casual relief staff who are required to cover for the staff member.Other rewards which were initially considered included social gatherings for staff, the installation of benches in major towns, restaurant vouchers and passes to local attractions, such as the Great Tapestry of Scotland in Galashiels."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-house-extension-bid-go-planning-committee","story":"A PLANNED extension to a Peebles house previously labelled as “insensitive” by an architectural society has moved a step closer.Scottish Borders Council’splanning chiefs have recommended that the Dean Park development should be approved.The matter is due to be discussed by the local authority’s planning and building standards committee on Monday .The applicant, Xuilan Yang, wants to build a single-storey extension and two dormers to the rear of the th century property.Mrs Yang also intends to add a porch and solar  to the front of the terraced property.But a number of objections had been submitted in response to the application, including from the Peebles Civic Society and the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland .Loss of privacy, impact on conservation area, and impact on residential amenity were among the reasons for the opposition to the plans.A spokesperson for the AHSS said the solar  were “insensitively positioned, excessive in size, and would break up the run of unorm roofs with an essentially industrial material”, while they also said the proposed porch was “not sensitively designed and protrudes excessively”.However, members of the SBC committee have been told to approve the development after the applicant submitted revised plans.An SBC report states: “Although the dormers would be visible from Edinburgh Road, the degree of visibility from the public realm would not be so signicant as to have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the conservation area.“The proposals for the front elevation are much more visible from the public realm and revisions have been submitted in order to address some of the concerns raised by third parties, including the Civic Society and AHSS.“The porch, which has been reduced in size, would match the overall appearance of that on the adjoining property to the east and it would not project further forward from the principal elevation than the bay window or other porches in the street.”.removeOn the solar , it adds: “It is acknowledged that these would be the first PV  to be installed on this terrace and this will undoubtedly have an impact on [the] street scene.“However, and acknowledging the concerns raised by objectors, the layout of the  has been amended to show a single row of five  at high level, just below the ridge and above the existing dormer window. The revised pattern is now considered acceptable.“Although each case must be treated on its own merits, the proposed layout could set a positive pattern for others to follow.”"},{"url":null,"title":"unconfirmed-reports-serious-injury-kelso-races","story":"UPDATE: JOCKEY Conner McCann required medical attention following a fall at the second flight in the mf handicap hurdle at Kelso this afternoon.He was riding Diamond State.McCann was attended to by medical staff on the course.The air ambulance arrived shortly after pm.It is now understood that Conner left the race ground in a vehicle ambulance and not the air ambulance.Racing has now resumed.More to follow:"},{"url":null,"title":"schools-asked-teach-32-5-hours-week","story":"Schools will be asked to ensure their week is at least . hours long by September  in the forthcoming White Paper, it has been revealed.The Schools White Paper, published in full on Monday, will detail how school weeks should run for at least -and-a-half hours, from for example .am to .pm Monday to Friday.While most school weeks across primary and secondary schools in England cover thisof time, the Department for Education said there are some “discrepancies” which could see a pupil who receives  minutes’ less teaching time per day lose out on around two weeks of schooling per year.As one of several measures set out in the White Paper, the DfE said the change aimed to build upon the Government’s Levelling Up mission for schools, which aims for % of pupils leaving primary school to have reached expected standards in numeracy and literacy.On Tuesday, the long-awaited Special Educational Needs and DisabilityReview will also be published.“The Send and alternative provision green paper will build on education support and change the culture and practice in mainstream schools to be more inclusive, helping the workforce to adapt to every pupil’s needs,” the DfE said.The Labour Party’s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said that the proposals amounted to telling most schools to “carry on as normal”.She said that after two years of “pandemic chaos” the plan would leave parents, teachers and pupils “wondering where the ambition for children’s futures is”.“For almost eight in  schools, the Education Secretary’s big idea is to carry on as normal,” she said.“Hundreds of thousands of primary children live in an area with no ‘good’ schools, the gap in learning between the most and least well-off pupils has widened during Covid, four in  young people leave education without the skills they need and young people are experiencing a mental health crisis. Yet the government has no answers,” Ms Phillipson said..removeLabour pointed out that % of schools had days that met the averageof between six hours  minutes and six hours  minutes.Headteachers have also said they are “unconvinced” of the benefits of a minimum expectation for theof the school week.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are unconvinced by the benefits of introducing a minimum expectation on theof the school week of . hours.”He said that the vast majority of schools already met this expectation or came “very close” to meeting it, and that it was important to understand the factors that might lead to a shorter week in some schools.“For example, it may be the case in some rural schools that start and finish times are affected by transport arrangements,” he said.“Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in inidual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes.”“We look forward to seeing the full details of the schools white paper and the SEND and alternative provision green paper,” he added.And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We hope that during the year before these proposals are implemented, there can be a review of the evidence supporting this plan.”“Simply adding five or ten minutes to a day is unlikely to bring much,any, benefit.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet the government has no answers,” Ms Phillipson said.Labour pointed out that % of schools had days that met the averageof between six hours  minutes and six hours  minutes.Headteachers have also said they are “unconvinced” of the benefits of a minimum expectation for theof the school week.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are unconvinced by the benefits of introducing a minimum expectation on theof the school week of . hours.”He said that the vast majority of schools already met this expectation or came “very close” to meeting it, and that it was important to understand the factors that might lead to a shorter week in some schools.“For example, it may be the case in some rural schools that start and finish times are affected by transport arrangements,” he said.“Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in inidual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes.”“We look forward to seeing the full details of the schools white paper and the SEND and alternative provision green paper,” he added.And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We hope that during the year before these proposals are implemented, there can be a review of the evidence supporting this plan.”“Simply adding five or ten minutes to a day is unlikely to bring much,any, benefit. The government says it will be guided by evidence – they need to meet that undertaking,” he said.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said that the education sector was “crying out” for a Schools White Paper and Send Green Paper that addressed “the huge challenges that battered and bruised schools face to support all their pupils during and beyond a pandemic”.“The expectation of a . hour week for pupils is a classic example of Government trying to hit a target but missing the point,” he said.“The vast majority of schools’ days are of thisor a little more or less. We are looking for much more sophisticated change.”“Where is the multaceted recovery plan  What should happen in the extra - mins some pupils will now spend in school  How will pupil wellbeing and education staff workloads be improved to ensure their time together is as impactful as both want and deserve ” he added.“Children, parents and those that teach and support them need more from a government policy  than easy headlines like this.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “Every child deserves support from excellent teachers, who in turn deserve to be backed by a supportive and inclusive school, whether they live in Doncaster or Dartmouth, whether they plan to study T-levels or A-levels, whatever their background.“Over my time as Education Secretary, my guiding focus has been creating opportunity for all, with strong schools and great teachers for every child. Every plan and policy I will set out in next week’s Schools White Paper works towards this goal.“The Schools White Paper, closely followed by the Send Green Paper, will demonstrate levelling up in action, delivering fairness for every child and making sure nobody is left behind.”"},{"url":null,"title":"joe-biden-calls-regime-change-moscow-likens-invasion-ww2-horrors  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It’s a lie, it’s just cynical – he knows that,” Mr Biden said.“And it’s also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, he’s Jewish, his father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity – like all autocrats before him – to believe that might will make right.”The brave Ukrainian resistance is a front in a larger fight: for the essential democratic principles that unite all free people.These principles are essential for a free society, but have always been embattled.Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes.— President BidenMarch , But as he made an impassioned defence of democracy, he reminded European nations they must end “dependence on Russian fossil fuels”.Sanctions, he said, have been sapping Russia’s strength and have reduced the rouble “to rubble”.But Mr Biden warned: “This battle will not be won in days, or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”Despite clearly calling for Mr Putin to go at the end of his speech, a White House official tried to argue that the US President’s point was that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”.“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” the official added, before reports in the US suggested the remarks in question had not been scripted.Unwise comment:It’s for the Russian people to draw thisconclusion.Putin  Xiwill now read ‘regime change’ as POTUS’ wider objective – beyond supporting Ukraine.Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder. pic GEbcAaL— Tobias Ellwood MPMarch , Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said Mr Biden’s comment was “unwise”.He warned the Russian president will now see regime change as Mr Biden’s wider objective, adding: “Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder.”Mr Biden stopped at RAF Mildenhall, a base in Suffolk that supports US military operations, on his way back to Washington so that his Air Force One jet could refuel.Moscow has gave an indication it could scale back its offensive to focus on what it claimed was the “main goal, liberation of Donbas”, the region bordering Russia in the east of Ukraine.Mr Zelensky’s forces were regaining ground around the capital of Kyiv and the UK Ministry of Defencesaid Russians are “proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations”.Instead, the MoD said, they were preferring the “indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralise defending forces”. vw,vw,px, px\"A Ukrainian soldier on top of his APC on the front line position near Kharkiv, Ukraine However, there were fresh signs it was Mr Putin’s troops who were struggling with morale, as Western intelligence suggested a Russian brigade commander, Colonel Medvechek, was deliberately run down and possibly killed by his own troops.An adviser to the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Markian Lubkivskyi, predicted troops could on Saturday take back Kherson, the first major city that the Kremlin’s forces seized.He was sceptical that the Russian President’s aims had truly changed away from trying to take the whole nation, but said it does appear “the enemy is focused on the eastern part of Ukraine”.The port city Kherson, in the south east, fell to the Russians early this month in their first major gain.But Mr Lubkivskyi told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces.“We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"russian-sanctions-lifted-invading-forces-withdrawn-truss-says   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648210667218.jpg--recommendation_for_post_primary_pupils_to_wear_facemasks_to_be_scrapped_after_easter.jpg?1648210667000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220325newsrecommendation for post primary pupils to wear facemasks to be scrapped after easter","story":"It will no longer be recommended that post-primary pupils wear a face covering in corridors or confined communal areas following the Easter break. This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.

It spooked the party, a leadership challenge followed, and three months later Arlene Foster was gone.Polls increasingly appear to set the agenda. The TUV’s ratings rise has arguably led the DUP to harden its protocol stance and to collapse the Executive.The UUP’s strong showing in successive surveys since Doug Beattie took over has surely strengthened his hand with conservative elements in the party who otherwise might have publicly aired opposition to his liberal direction.Lacklustre ratings for the SDLP in both LucidTalk and a recent Irish News University of Liverpool poll — putting it on just % — cast a shadow over the party as it prepares for May’s Assembly election.“I think too much attention is given to polls in Northern Ireland,” Colum Eastwood said recently. That’s an entirely understandable complaint from his viewpoint.There’s a danger for the party that the polls become a self-fulfilling prophecy — the ‘loser’ label is fixed in the public mind before a single vote is cast.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A key debate has long been whether polls simply measure public opinion or influence it.Some believe that the ‘bandwagon effect’ makes polls positively dangerous. Negative ratings are fatal as people’s preferences sht to whoever is ahead.Rather than making informed choices, voters conform to majority opinion. The subconscious desire to join the crowd, to be on the winning side, leads them to support parties with a high level of support.Some argue that rather than being just a tool to discover the wishes of the public, polls disrupt the democratic process. Critics claim that pollsters are too powerful.Bill White, who runs LucidTalk, robustly challenges that argument. “Did the DUP dump Arlene Foster on the basis of last February’s LucidTalk poll  No,” he said.“I would be very worriedI thought that seasoned political figures made decisions based purely on a poll. It may have been a spark that led to moves against her but that would have been because it chimed with what DUP people were already hearing on the ground.“Had it not matched what they were being told on doorsteps it wouldn’t have been taken seriously. Polls have to feel right.”There are numerous large polling organisations in Britain. LucidTalk and Social Market Research, which conducted the Irish News University of Liverpool poll, are two Belfast-based companies carrying out political polling here.White, who worked in market research and IT in London and Dublin, set up LucidTalk in .“Online polling came to London in the late s. About a decade later, I thought it was a good thing to start here,” he said.White was “greatly encouraged” by Liam Clarke, the late and highly respected political editor of the Belfast : “Liam would conduct his own informal polling at party conferences, asking delegates for their views on a range of topical issues.“He was very data-driven and thought online polling with a really good sample size would be a big step forward.“By , nearly everybody had a computer or laptop and an email address. The great thing about online polling was its confidentiality and that’s so important in a place like Northern Ireland.“You do it in your own home, and you do it directly. You remove all human interaction. When you vote somebody hands you a ballot, but you mark it in the privacy of a polling booth.“Nobody knows your views unless you choose to tell them. Polling benefits when the same approach applies.”While occasional opinion polls were carried out in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, White says regular and political polling would have been impossible for a local company as the conflict raged.“Somebody would have threatened to blow your head offthey didn’t like the results, particularlyit concerned a contentious and emotional an issue like the border” he said..“I get a bit of grief on social media nowadays. Somebody recently told me: ‘Be careful you don’t get a knock on the door’.“Imagine what a pollster would have endured in the Seventies and Eighties here “It would have been only a small minority getting upset, but it would have been a very dangerous minority.”White says many other problems would have plagued pollsters during the Troubles: “With no internet, face-to-face polling would have been necessary.“It would have been challenging for interviewers to go into republican or loyalist areas, knock on doors, and ask people who they were planning to vote for. A lot of doors would have been slammed in a lot of faces.“In other cases, people would have been reluctant to tell the truth about who they were voting for because they wouldn’t want to offend the interviewer.“They would have been reserved for fear of hurting the feelings of the questioner. Other folk would just have been genuinely nervous about opening up.“It’s a sign of how Northern Ireland is progressing to a normal society, how the situation is calmer and more settled, that we actually can conduct regular polling on political issues.”The few polls that were carried out during the conflict, and in the decade after the ceasefires, often signicantly under-estimated support for the DUP, and particularly Sinn Fein.A survey just before the  Westminster election put Sinn Fein on %. It secured a % vote.A poll ahead of the  Assembly election put the DUP and Sinn Fein both on %. They secured % and % respectively.The existence of the ‘shy’ Sinn Fein or DUP voter — reluctant to say they voted for a party considered extreme — skewed many polls.In Britain, politicians have made fatal mistakes based on polling.Theresa May opted for an early election in April  when the Tories’ average poll lead over Labour was % points. Fty days later, a general election resulted in a hung Parliament.White believes much criticism of polling is unfair: “Pollsters don’t have super powers, we don’t predict the future.“A poll is only a snapshot in time. You treat a poll like the weather forecast.“It says ‘Showers in North Down’, so you take an umbrella, but you don’t knowit’s actually going to be raining at precisely .pm when you’re visiting Aunt Mabel in Bangor. Polls are about identying trends.”White warns that polls struggle much more with the outcome of referenda than elections.“A referendum campaign is entirely dferent to an election campaign,” he added.“It’s big and unknown. You’re spinning the roulette wheel. In Scotland the pro-independence campaign started on % — it was neck-and-neck near the end of the campaign. If a border poll was called here nobody knows how it would go. There are countless factors that could influence how it developed. So many people who never voted in elections would likely turn out.”Related topicsLucidTalk pollArlene FosterTraditional Unionist VoiceNI ProtocolThe Executive OfficeUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieSDLPColum EastwoodSinn FéinMore On LucidTalk poll PremiumViewpointOpinionChange has been a long time coming PremiumJon TongeOpinionWill Alliance’s moderate politics become a big deal in May Integrated education campaigners throw down gauntlet to UUPPoll: Unionists more concerned about NHS than Northern Ireland protocolKaty Hayward and David PhinnemoreOpinionDo you understand the Protocol, and does it really matter anyway Most ReadMark Sykes’ ‘no-brainer’ decision to play for Republic of Ireland as dad hits back at ‘bigot’ accusations with Belfast star in line to bridge  year gapReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraAmazing space: £k Co Down home sure to attract the crowds to Killinchy Road‘How dare anyone do this ’ – Grieving woman hits out as bomb hoax ‘destroyed’ mother’s funeralSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly companyTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Mallon labels DUP ‘a party of irrational mood swings’SDLP leader says election offers chance to break ‘cycle of crisis and collapse’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionSuzanne BreenOpinionThe DUP’s failings are Sinn Fein’s biggest strength in the upcoming Stormont electionCall for unionist parties to stand aside in west Belfast for community candidate in Assembly electionLatestChristian Eriksen scores on emotional Denmarkin defeat to HollandEngland capitulated with no spirit or fight – former captain Michael VaughanRugby Football Union hopes Eddie Jones’ replacement will be EnglishWilliam says future of monarchy in Caribbean ‘for people to decide’Fire in Dublin city centre leaves six people injured,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Faulkner and other Cabinet ministers address a mass rally of Vanguard supporters from the balcony of StormontMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAt .pm, on March , , Northern Ireland’s House of Commons adjourned. It was never to meet again. Two days later the NI Temporary Provisions Act became law, introducing direct rule, ending  years of unionist government, bringing devolution to a stop and shutting down NI’s Parliament. It was the biggest crisis for unionism since the  Home Rule Bill.At lunchtime on March , Brian Faulkner, destined to be NI’s last Prime Minister, led his Cabinet onto the balcony to address the enormous crowdwhich had gathered in the grounds. He had only a loudspeaker.“People of Ulster, I am speaking to you still as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. I want to say, not just on my own behalf, but on behalf of every one of my colleagues in the Government and the Parliamentary Party here at Stormont, that we understand absolutely the feelings which have persuaded you to come out to Parliament Buildings today… we share the resentment that you feel. We have tremendous power.“Our power is the power of our numbers our power is the justice of our cause our power is the responsibility of our conduct. Let us never play the game of the murderers of the IRA. Let us show the world that, so far as we are concerned, violence and intimidation are out. British we are and British we remain!”The previous day Faulkner had addressed an emergency meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council, informing it that his government had lost confidence in Edward Heath’s administration.By his own admission it was an angry meeting seething at what was regarded as a betrayal and surrender to unionism’s enemies. But he also warned them to shun violent responses and rely, instead, on the ‘Unionist veto’ which lay in the strength of their numbers.Exactly  years later, on Monday March , the present Assembly will be dissolved in preparation for an election on May . There are many within the unionist community who believe that, like its predecessor on March , , this institution will not meet again.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Political unionism is again seething with anger, believing that another Conservative government has betrayed it and rolled over to the demands of those who want Northern Ireland removed from the United Kingdom. Indeed, they would argue that the process of removal has been advanced by a protocol which traps Northern Ireland in some sort of constitutional halfway house between Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.When Brian Faulkner spoke of unionism relying on the strength of its numbers it was at a time when the combined pro-Union vote hovered around two-thirds of the overall vote.At the election for the first post-NI Parliament Assembly, in June , the pro-Union votewas %. In the  Assembly election that votehad reduced to .%.That election also saw unionism reduced to a minority within an NI Parliament and Assembly: and there is now a possibility, come May , that unionism won’t even have the numbers to qualy for the position of First Minister.And yet unionism remains as ided now as it was back in . The narrowing of the demographic gap between unionism and nationalism, along with an ongoing reluctance by successive British governments to be seen to be what might be described as pro-active on behalf of unionism, hasn’t pushed it in the direction of prioritising a coherent, collective, long-term strategy for survival.Even the thundering hammer-blows rained down on the DUP by Boris Johnson continue to be greeted with fairly mild responses from the party leadership.Speaking on Monday evening Jeffrey Donaldson acknowledged the problem: “It’s not a question of throwing the DUP under the bus. The Prime Minister threw Northern Ireland under the bus and the harm that this protocol has done to Northern Ireland is, I think, something the Prime Minister now recognises. But we need him to do something about it.”The problem, of course, is that Donaldson has been saying this since September last yearand Johnson has done nothing. He’ll continue to do nothing until May : and, in all likelihood, will do nothing after that, either.In March  Brian Faulkner and the UUP decided to risk the collapse of the NI Parliament rather than allow control of security to pass from the NI government to Westminster.A few days before Stormont was prorogued Faulkner had written to Edward Heath: ‘We wish to point out with a sense of the heavy responsibility involved that the imposition of this proposal, involving as it will the resignation of the Government of Northern Ireland as a whole, may have the gravest consequences, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen.’We now know the primary consequence of the resignation and subsequent prorogation: the end of majority rule, the introduction of mandatory power-sharingand the sapping of unionist confidence that their future position within the United Kingdom was, to all intents and purposes, secure.What Faulkner did — although I fully understand why he had to do it — was hand over the political negotiating process to a British government which was determined to build an entirely dferent relationship with its Irish counterpart.In his biography, Memoirs of a Statesman , Faulkner hinted at regrets: “... when unionists of vision tried to stimulate new thinking and broaden the appeal of unionism in the s s I did not come out and support them. I did not think they were achieving anything useful...but we should have spent more time watering the roots of tolerance.“We did not take the initiative in reforming our society until events forced change on us. By  we were reacting to events rather than controlling them and one was always conscious of running very fast merely to make up lost ground.’Since then, a number of other unionist loyalist leaders have voiced fairly similar regrets. Sometimes about their own personal lack of foresight and sometimes about opportunities which unionism may have missed over the decades.Yet as Faulkner noted, there was always a sense that unionism was a few steps behind the thinking of others when it came to mapping out Northern Ireland’s post- future. Or, as former UUP leader Reg Empey put it, “every time unionism walks from the table it inevitably and iniably s to another table with a weaker hand”.In the early s a Minister of State based in the NIO told me: “The problem with unionism — and it’s a particular problem for those outside Northern Ireland who try to understand it — is that there are far too many ieties. They spend as much time complaining about their unionist rivals as they do complaining about their more specic political and constitutional opponents.”From until the collapse of Stormont in  the isions could mostly be controlled by the mantra — ‘United we stand. Divided we fall.’ But once the fall came there was nothing to hold unionism together and it splintered and continues to splinter.Faulkner and power-sharing were destroyed by the United Ulster Unionist Council in . Shortly afterwards the ious members of the UUUC — who couldn’t come up with an agreed alternative to the Sunningdale deal — turned on themselves.The UUP descended into civil war between -. The loyalist paramilitary groups, essential to the ‘selling’ of the Good Friday Agreement, have now withdrawn support for it. The DUP has had a horrible  months and is still beset with internal dficulties.A growing element of younger loyalism is pushing its anti-protocol campaigning towards prioritising the final collapse of the GFA institutions. And Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allisterhave laid down pre-election preconditions on both the protocol and the eventuality of a Sinn Fein First Minister.Change a few names and organisations and we could be talking about that period from March  to May  — when unionism and loyalism were struggling to find a route map from the crisis forced on them by widespread political societal instability and British governments which were determined to impose change upon them.But here’s the reality:the strategies and policies adopted by unionists didn’t work back then, why does anyone think terribly similar strategies and policies would work today: particularly when the constitutional crisis is worse now than then and the shadow of a border poll is hanging over every aspect of the coming election.A British state paper released in  had this assessment of the  Assembly election: ‘Mr Faulkner’s position is undoubtedly dficult. He will have less than half of the Protestant vote behind him, as Dr Paisley and others will no doubt vocerously remind him,and when he makes an effort to work the new system.“It was always to be anticipated that the Protestant vote would be fragmented… but the outcome has left the potential accepters weaker and the ‘wreckers’ stronger than expected.’Something very similar happened to David Trimble in , allowing his internal and external opponents to destroy him. Might the same thing be about to happen to Jeffrey Donaldson  Between  and  the DUP vote represented a majority of unionist votes cast — but even then, the party had to temper a lot of decisions and steer away from potential compromises and concessions. If the DUP doesn’t represent the majority of unionist votes cast and seats won in the Assembly on May  it will make it very dficult for Donaldson to reboot the executive.We seem to be on ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ territory for unionism. Again. But there is one dference. I was in that crowd in the grounds of Stormont on March , , a few months short of my th birthday.I recognised the scale of the shock: but I also recognised something , a new opportunity for unionism to do things dferently.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

HELEN MCGURK talks to its creator, Jay OsmondBy Helen McGurkFriday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  Jay Osmond in Belfast for the launch of The Osmonds: A New Musical at the Grand Opera House“Our song Crazy Horses was banned in South Africa because they thought it was about drugs. I said, ‘Really  C’mon, we’re The Osmonds.” laughs Jay Osmond, flashing that famous toothsome megawatt Osmonds smile.The fourth youngest of the nine-strong Osmond family, sees the absurdity of the accusation because as everyone knows, the Mormon minstrels were a famously squeaky-clean band of brothers, eschewing rock and roll’s twin evils of drink and drugs, to produce wholesome, harmony-drenched pop tunes.Jay Osmond, , is in Belfast to talk about his upcoming show The Osmonds: A New Musical at the Grand Opera House.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That’s why it’s so fast-paced.“It’s not a concert or a tribute band show, or even a juke box musical. I take people on a musical journey through what it was like from my point of view. It’s about the ups and downs, the highs and lows, the good times, the bad times. So much happens.”ALL THE HITS The musical features a chart-topping list of anthems including Love Me For A Reason, Let Me In, Puppy Love, One Bad Apple, Long Haired Lover From Liverpool, Paper Roses and many more, taking audiences back to relive the s, s and s.“It’s like a time machine. People say it makes them feel like  again,” he says. Jay was the drummer for the family quintet. He also shared lead vocals on the hard rock, musically ergent, Crazy Horses, which was about gas-guzzling cars, rather than narcotics. According to Jay, his father George, a World War II veteran, was the “backbone” of the group and he wishes he, and his mother Olive, were still alive to see the musical.“The hardest part of this show is how to portray my father. Mother was pretty easy because she was always positive and very upbeat.“My father was an army sergeant and he was a good disciplinarian, but he wasn’t abusive in any way. He was very strong and tender at the same time. My father was a great man. He’s been the most dficult one to cast for.”George Osmond instilled a firm set of values in his children - faith, family and career - in that order. “Whenever we were up against anything it was always in that priority system. And we had a voting system and a way of working out problems.”There are scenes in the musical which Jay still gets emotional watching. “A lot of people don’t know what we were up against as a family. There’s one scene where we have a family meeting - and without giving too much away, it’s really tough... you can hear a pin drop, it’s so quiet when the audience is listening.“You wouldn’t believe some of the obstacles we overcame as a family. It would have broken most families in a normal situation.” CLEAN-LIVING The Osmonds’ vocal harmonising is technically on the same level as the Beach Boys and the Beatles . Unfortunately, they weren’t take as seriously as those bands. Did their devout faith prevent them being a credible musical force “We were up against nightmare stuff. We were told even back in the s that we would never make it in rock n roll because we didn’t smoke or drink or take drugs,” says Jay. “But, my father said persistence and determination are the two keys that make success and that’s we did, we persisted and were determined. This musical shows how hard we worked.” His brothers Donny and Merrill have seen clips of the show and have given it their seal of approval. “I received an email the other day from Donny and he said ‘I am blown away - especially with the reviews’. He said ‘I knew you could to it’.“Then I got one about a month go from Merill saying ‘Proud of you, Jay’.“Five years ago when the producer came to me with the ideaI went to my brother Merrill and said I think this is really amazing, we have a great opportunity to tell our story, but he couldn’t because of a project he was working on, but he said ‘I know you can do it’.“At first I was a little depressed about it because I never thought I could do this on my own, I always had a brother to do things with me, but it’s amazing how it’s come out. “After five years of seeing it on paper, and then to see your le acted out on stage, how surreal that was to me, and still is.”The whole process, he says, has been a kind of “therapy” for him. “And thank goodness for my journals. My mother was adamant about us writing in journals.”It’s been a long road to get the musical from concept to stage, but Jay is clearly chuffed with the result. “I think of all the projects I have ever done, this is the one I am most pleased with,” he says, that signature Osmond smile lighting up the room.The Osmonds: A New Musical, opens at the Grand Opera House, on April .

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So, when you ask meI get itI didn’t get it we would not have set the ambition of changing the Protocol,” he said.Speaking just  hours before a loyalist paramilitary bomb scare forced Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney to abandon a speech in north Belfast and be whisked away by police to a secure location, Mr Burns condemned any moves to violently resist the Protocol.“This society has not thrived when threats of violence are used to achieve a political objective.”On the continued existence of the Protocol in its present form where more than  EU rules now govern Northern Ireland’s economic and commercial le, Mr Burns said: “I have to say that we cannot go on indefinitely and one of the things that everyone who is engaged with the European Commission and the EU member states on this has been clear - the Protocol is not currently commanding cross-community support here in Northern Ireland. “And when something is not broadly accepted by both traditions here it is rarely a good thing for Northern Ireland. A change there has to be and we have also been incredibly clear, the Secretary of Statehas made this clear, the PM has made this clear, Liz Truss has made it clear that we have been very concerned that the application of the Protocol was having a de-stabilising effect on the governance and the stability here in Northern Ireland, and there needs to be change.”The Minister of State said he knows that the EU’s chief negotiator on the Protocol Maros Sefcovic has been warned about this de-stabilisation during his visits to the Province.He denied that the Government’s eyes were off the Protocol ball now that it is dealing with the war in Ukraine and its consequences for European and global security. Mr Burns also insisted that the Government was still prepared to trigger Article  which could put a temporary stop to the Protocol and its outworkings.A close ally of Boris Johnson, the Minister said: “The Prime Minister wants the EU to undertand that we did not use Article  as an act of good faith to show we want to get a sustainable and lasting solution. I hope the EU are hearing us. The Prime Minister is very clear about this that there is nothing that is off the table.”Mr Burns defended the Northern Ireland Secretary’s plans for dealing with Legacy issues related to the Troubles including shting from investigations into the conflict from criminal inquiries into a truth recovery scheme.“You know the easiest thing to do on Legacy would be to do nothing and I actually think the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister deserve credit for seeking to enter this space and find a way to help this society especially for some of those most affected by the Troubles.”Reflecting on Legacy Mr Burns casts his mind back to August  and the Real IRA Omagh bomb massacre which occured during one of his visits to his relations.“I remember being in my grandma’s living room on the day of the Omagh bombing and finding out that one of my cousin’s children was in Omagh that day. There was this absolutely overwhelming sense of fear especially when all the lines to Omagh went down as we tried to get through.”He still sees most of his family the majority of whom are very comfortable with their Catholic cousin being a British minister arguing for the merits of the Union. Only two relations who are republicans have made it clear they do not wish to see him, Mr Burns said.“Let’s just say they are not paid up members of the Tory No Turning Back group,” he added.A past pupil of the Christian Brothers run Park Lodge Primary School on Belfast’s Antrim Road, he revealed that he once considered entering the priesthood.He cited the late Pope John Paul II alongside Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as both his heroes and his reason to join the Tory Party even before he turned  because of their “defence of the values of inidual freedom” against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.Mr Burns came out as gay in his mid s and acknowledges that it was Tony Blair and New Labour who “turbo charged social change” to in turn liberalise attitudes towards gay people in the Conservative Party.He describes himself as having a “multi-facted identity. I am a Catholic, I am gay, I support the Union, I am a Conservative, I would still call myself a Thatcherite, I am Northern Irish, I am Irish, I am British.” More from the News Letter:Click here: Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoClick here: Protest at Belfast factory over ‘ludicrous nature of arms trade’ with equipment built by Thales being used by both Ukraine AND RussiaClick here: Plan unveiled for huge expansion of Co Antrim village bringing hundreds of new residentsClick here:Joe Biden tells St Patrick’s Day gathering: I may be Irish but I’m not stupid——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Irish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureAnti-Protocol activist says loyalists could take protests to heart of Dublin as Saoradh members fail to materialiseWATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyMost PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenGt ideas for Mothering Sunday: special, unique Mother’s Day presents for Best air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and Snugpak                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Irish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureAnti-Protocol activist says loyalists could take protests to heart of Dublin as Saoradh members fail to materialiseWATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyMost PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenGt ideas for Mothering Sunday: special, unique Mother’s Day presents for Best air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and Snugpak                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Schools White Paper, published in full on Monday, will detail how school weeks should run for at least -and-a-half hours, from for example .am to .pm Monday to Friday.While most school weeks across primary and secondary schools in England cover thisof time, the Department for Education said there are some “discrepancies” which could see a pupil who receives  minutes’ less teaching time per day lose out on around two weeks of schooling per year.As one of several measures set out in the White Paper, the DfE said the change aimed to build upon the Government’s Levelling Up mission for schools, which aims for % of pupils leaving primary school to have reached expected standards in numeracy and literacy.On Tuesday, the long-awaited Special Educational Needs and DisabilityReview will also be published.“The Send and alternative provision green paper will build on education support and change the culture and practice in mainstream schools to be more inclusive, helping the workforce to adapt to every pupil’s needs,” the DfE said.The Labour Party’s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said that the proposals amounted to telling most schools to “carry on as normal”.She said that after two years of “pandemic chaos” the plan would leave parents, teachers and pupils “wondering where the ambition for children’s futures is”.“For almost eight in  schools, the Education Secretary’s big idea is to carry on as normal,” she said.“Hundreds of thousands of primary children live in an area with no ‘good’ schools, the gap in learning between the most and least well-off pupils has widened during Covid, four in  young people leave education without the skills they need and young people are experiencing a mental health crisis. Yet the government has no answers,” Ms Phillipson said..removeLabour pointed out that % of schools had days that met the averageof between six hours  minutes and six hours  minutes.Headteachers have also said they are “unconvinced” of the benefits of a minimum expectation for theof the school week.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are unconvinced by the benefits of introducing a minimum expectation on theof the school week of . hours.”He said that the vast majority of schools already met this expectation or came “very close” to meeting it, and that it was important to understand the factors that might lead to a shorter week in some schools.“For example, it may be the case in some rural schools that start and finish times are affected by transport arrangements,” he said.“Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in inidual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes.”“We look forward to seeing the full details of the schools white paper and the SEND and alternative provision green paper,” he added.And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We hope that during the year before these proposals are implemented, there can be a review of the evidence supporting this plan.”“Simply adding five or ten minutes to a day is unlikely to bring much,any, benefit. The government says it will be guided by evidence – they need to meet that undertaking,” he said.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said that the education sector was “crying out” for a Schools White Paper and Send Green Paper that addressed “the huge challenges that battered and bruised schools face to support all their pupils during and beyond a pandemic”.“The expectation of a . hour week for pupils is a classic example of Government trying to hit a target but missing the point,” he said.“The vast majority of schools’ days are of thisor a little more or less. We are looking for much more sophisticated change.”“Where is the multaceted recovery plan  What should happen in the extra - mins some pupils will now spend in school  How will pupil wellbeing and education staff workloads be improved to ensure their time together is as impactful as both want and deserve ” he added.“Children, parents and those that teach and support them need more from a government policy  than easy headlines like this.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “Every child deserves support from excellent teachers, who in turn deserve to be backed by a supportive and inclusive school, whether they live in Doncaster or Dartmouth, whether they plan to study T-levels or A-levels, whatever their background.“Over my time as Education Secretary, my guiding focus has been creating opportunity for all, with strong schools and great teachers for every child. Every plan and policy I will set out in next week’s Schools White Paper works towards this goal.“The Schools White Paper, closely followed by the Send Green Paper, will demonstrate levelling up in action, delivering fairness for every child and making sure nobody is left behind.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Schools asked to teach for . hours a week or more article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community“For God’s sake this man cannot remain in power,” the US president said, apparently calling for regime change in Moscow at the end of a speech from Poland on Saturday.He said “ you’re able to listen: you, the Russian people, are not our enemy” before evoking the Nazi’s siege of Leningrad and likening it to the atrocities in Ukraine.“These are not the actions of a great nation,” Mr Biden said, in front of the Royal Castle, a landmark in Warsaw that was badly damaged during Adolf Hitler’s war.“Of all people, you the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the s and s, the situation of World War Two, still fresh in the mind of many grandparents in the region.”“Whatever your generation experienced, whether it experienced the siege of Leningrad, or heard about it from your parents and grandparents, train stations overflowing with terried families fleeing their homes, nights sheltering in basements and cellars, mornings sting through the rubble in your home – these are not memories of the past – not any more, it’s exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now.”Multiple rockets struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv near the Polish border during Mr Biden’s visit, which came as Russia faced the prospect of further setbacks in the war.The US president said Moscow’s troops have “met their match with brave and stf Ukrainian resistance” and have strengthened the resolve and unity of both the defending forces and the West.“Russia wanted less of a Nato presence on his border but now he has a stronger presence, a larger presence,” he said. vw,vw,px, px\"US president Joe Biden delivers a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw .removeMr Biden said , Russians had left their country in a single month in a “remarkable brain drain” as Mr Putin, who he earlier called a “butcher”, had “strangled democracy”.Addressing the thousand-strong audience that included refugees who have fled the war, he told Ukrainians “we stand with you – period” as he defended the nation’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.“Putin has the gall to say he’s denazying Ukraine. It’s a lie, it’s just cynical – he knows that,” Mr Biden said.“And it’s also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, he’s Jewish, his father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity – like all autocrats before him – to believe that might will make right.”The brave Ukrainian resistance is a front in a larger fight: for the essential democratic principles that unite all free people.These principles are essential for a free society, but have always been embattled.Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes.— President BidenMarch , But as he made an impassioned defence of democracy, he reminded European nations they must end “dependence on Russian fossil fuels”.Sanctions, he said, have been sapping Russia’s strength and have reduced the rouble “to rubble”.But Mr Biden warned: “This battle will not be won in days, or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”Despite clearly calling for Mr Putin to go at the end of his speech, a White House official tried to argue that the US President’s point was that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”.“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” the official added, before reports in the US suggested the remarks in question had not been scripted.Unwise comment:It’s for the Russian people to draw thisconclusion.Putin  Xiwill now read ‘regime change’ as POTUS’ wider objective – beyond supporting Ukraine.Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder. pic GEbcAaL— Tobias Ellwood MPMarch , Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said Mr Biden’s comment was “unwise”.He warned the Russian president will now see regime change as Mr Biden’s wider objective, adding: “Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder.”Mr Biden stopped at RAF Mildenhall, a base in Suffolk that supports US military operations, on his way back to Washington so that his Air Force One jet could refuel.Moscow has given an indication it could scale back its offensive to focus on what it claimed was the “main goal, liberation of Donbas”, the region bordering Russia in the east of Ukraine.Mr Zelensky’s forces were regaining ground around the capital of Kyiv and the UK Ministry of Defencesaid Russians are “proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations”.Instead, the MoD said, they were preferring the “indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralise defending forces”. vw,vw,px, px\"A Ukrainian soldier on top of his APC on the front line position near Kharkiv, Ukraine However, there were fresh signs it was Mr Putin’s troops who were struggling with morale, as Western intelligence suggested a Russian brigade commander, Colonel Medvechek, was deliberately run down and possibly killed by his own troops.An adviser to the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Markian Lubkivskyi, predicted troops could on Saturday take back Kherson, the first major city that the Kremlin’s forces seized.He was sceptical that the Russian President’s aims had truly changed away from trying to take the whole nation, but said it does appear “the enemy is focused on the eastern part of Ukraine”.The port city Kherson, in the south east, fell to the Russians early this month in their first major gain.But Mr Lubkivskyi told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces.“We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Joe Biden calls for regime change in Moscow as he likens invasion to WW horrors article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

That is a real lever that I think can be used.”Her remarks fit with those of her US counterpart Antony Blinken, who has said the travel bans and asset freezes are “not designed to be permanent”.The secretary of state said the sanctions could “go away” in the event of an “in effect, irreversible” withdrawal of Russian troops..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Russian sanctions could be lted after invading forces withdrawn, Truss says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.  A guidance note will issue to schools on this issue later today and my Department’s COVID guidance will be updated to reflect this position.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dedfdafaecc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aebaafadeabebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
