The ban also covers ski masks and full-face helmets. The government said people still have full freedom on how to dress, except when it is necessary to have full facial contact - for instance in education and health-related situations.The ban does not apply to public streets, although police can ask an inidual to remove face-covering clothing for identification.Annelies Moors, professor of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Amsterdam said: \u0027This is actually virtually a complete ban because the only spaces that are still available for women (who wear face-covering clothing) are the street and the private sector.\u0027And, of course, the private sector can also have their house rules, they could also possibly legislate against their presence. So this leaves women very little space.\u0027\u0027It is completely disproportionate and the only effect will be that many of these women will stay at home even more,\u0027 said Green Party senator Ruard Ganzevoort. \u0027They will not have an opportunity to go to school.

This matters because the intellectual, emotional and artistic health of the nation matters, and those who write contribute to the task of sustaining it.”Amanda Craig, whose latest book, The Lie of the Land, was published in 2017, said: “Women invariably do the majority of childrearing, which can mean they have 15 years or more of lower earning, particularly in something like fiction, which demands such a lot of concentration,” she said.Beevor, author of breakout bestseller Stalingrad, echoes Pullman’s concerns, adding that non-fiction authors face a particular problem if they have little money to fund their research. “Stalingrad took four years’ work, which was funded by publishing deals from the UK and abroad,” Beevor said. “I had tried writing part-time in the evening, but you are too knackered at the end of the day and I couldn’t do it.”He added that the decline in earnings threatened the ersity among writers and would favour economic advantage over talent. “We need professional writers, because otherwise only those with other sources of income will be able to write.”Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, criticises publishers and Amazon for not sharing a greater percentage of their booming profits with the people who supply their raw material. “What concerns us is that during the same period that we see authors’ earnings plummet, the large publishers are seeing their sales rocket,” she said.“When I started you could still make an okay living from writing. You can’t do that now,” said Sally Gardner, whose bestselling novel Maggot Moon won the Carnegie medal and Costa children’s book award, but came 20 years after her first book.As a result, she said, the ability of authors to craft their ideas over years and write books that tackled important questions had been seriously undermined. “Now the publishing business wants bestselling novels at whatever cost, but to develop talent and great writing you need patience, encouragement and financial support,” she added.Publishers being risk-averse had led to a situation where celebrity authors were leaving others with a smaller pool of money to compete for, Gardner added. As a result, authors were finding it harder to get novels that asked big questions into print.The 2018 ALCS survey covers writers from fields including stage and screen, but authors appear to fare worse than their counterparts in the creative arts. “If I had to rely on being a novelist, I would be skint,” said Jonathan Harvey, a novelist who supports his books with a day job as a playwright – his latest is the Dusty Springfield musical called Dusty – and as head scriptwriter for Coronation Street.“Authors are not a special case, deserving of more sympathy than many other groups,” said Pullman. “We are a particular case of a general degradation of the quality of life, and we are not going to stop pointing it out, because we speak for many other groups as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a5bbcd895da72c794f26aafb31c95c30321c005/0_581_3597_2158/master/3597.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f919c6ef544840eb0ebde4c037ce226","title":"jonathan franzen retiring authors","story":"They form an illustrious bunch, these authors who “retire” and then renege on that announcement, but one not short of members with commercial clout. Stephen King, currently back in the bestseller lists and seemingly averaging two or three titles a year, declared that he was “done with books” when he ostensibly stropped off back in 2002. Maeve Binchy, another sales banker for publishers, risked ruling out a comeback (“I’m not a Frank Sinatra person”) when she hung up her pen in 2000 after Scarlet Feather, but turned out several more novels.While King and Binchy may have chafed at the book-a-year demands of commercial publishing, exhausted literary novelists are the most frequent non-retiring retirees. Seven years before her Nobel win, Alice Munro, the short story specialist, said she was finished. No less fatigued was Anne Tyler, who said “I want to not ever finish a book again” a year or so before A Spool of Blue Thread came out and was picked for the 2015 Man Booker shortlist.Some authors do indeed stop (Philip Roth, for example) or stop publishing their work while continuing to write (JD Salinger) others definitively cease to produce work in a certain genre – TS Eliot quitting poetry, Herman Melville quitting the novel – and switch to another instead.So many authors in recent years have talked of “last books” that it’s hard to suspend disbelief. Especially quick to un-retire was Jim Crace, who talked repeatedly of looking forward to freedom and of Harvest as his farewell as it advanced towards the Man Booker shortlist (it was the bookies’s favourite), but realised he was wrong to want “a orce from writing”. Perhaps publishers shouldn’t plan a collected Franzen edition just yet.

The\u0026nbspexistence of dangers – from terrorism and cyberwarfare to nuclear proliferation and a pattern of Russian provocations – is beyond question. But to identify a threat is not the same as knowing how to handle it and, since the imagination can always conjure a worst-case scenario, the shopping list of desirable hardware can be long and very expensive.But resources are finite compromise is inevitable. Military chiefs always want bigger budgets, and ministers, keen to show voters that they take no chances with national security, are reluctant to contradict the khaki lobby. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has gone a step further, noisily demanding cash from the prime minister and the chancellor.Mr Williamson has let it be known that he requires an annual budget uplift of up to £4bn. He has been emboldened to push this case by the recent decision to allocate an extra £20bn to the NHS. If austerity is eased for hospitals – the argument goes – why shouldn’t defence be next in line for largesse?The military has been squeezed since 2010. But it also has a record of wasteful procurement. Philip Hammond knows this better than most since he strived, as David Cameron’s defence secretary, to bring rigour to the system. Now chancellor, Mr Hammond is unimpressed by Mr Williamson’s posturing. He is right to be sceptical. The defence secretary’s short cabinet career has been marked by transparent self-aggrandisement, unsupported by proof of competence.The dilemma at the core of this dispute is not new. It is the latest chapter in the prolonged agony of Britain’s adjustment to its status as a large regional power – a big player by European standards – and not the imperial superpower it collectively remembers once being.There is a hole in the defence budget because the UK has made costly commitments to sustain a self-image as a nation capable of projecting force around the globe. These include renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent and new aircraft carriers complete with new fighter jets to be carried on them. Either the ambition – sometimes described as the maintenance of “tier one” power – must be scaled back or money must be erted from other departments. In reality, the tier one aspiration is a rhetorical prop. The UK will never equal China or the US for military capability. It cannot match Russia or India for volume of weaponry. The UK has some world-class features in its security arsenal – its special forces and intelligence services, for example. But it is not a superpower and should not bankrupt itself pretending to be one.To recognise that limitation is not weakness or defeatism. It takes cultural confidence to reach the hard-headed view of how the nation’s resources can be marshalled to maximise power and influence in the world. Pretending that such choices don’t need making is the backward-looking and cowardly path: one that diminishes security in the long term by dodging necessary strategic analysis.Maintaining the fiction that Britain is a stand-alone military force of global dimensions defers the business of cultivating the best regional security arrangements. It is a symptom of the Brexit delusion: that the UK has no need of Europe and is somehow greater without its neighbours. No outside observer believes that to be the case. Theresa May doesn’t believe it either, which is why she promises an intimate ongoing security partnership with the EU.Austerity has been hard on every public service, including the armed forces. The military is a deserving recipient of adequate funding, especially in a volatile international climate, but its appetite for funding is not so special that it needs no interrogation. The right response to shifting security threats is a strategically focused calibration of priorities and available resources. Posturing by the defence secretary, fuelled by naked personal ambition and tinged with imperial nostalgia, is not conducive to getting a realistic appraisal of what size and military capability most effectively serves the nation and its allies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2ee7711da55ec0f30b86646c06dd542c558efd/435_1054_3384_2029/master/3384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc4f7a008ffbd129d3bd9adf3dcba04","title":"british museum ivory figures sir victor sassoon","story":"Decision to accept objects from private collection not endorsement of ivory trade, director saysThe British Museum has defended its decision to accept a donation of more than 500 “exquisite” Chinese ivory figures, saying it did not mean it condoned the ivory trade.The museum revealed on Wednesday that it had accepted the gift of 556 ivory items acquired in the early 20th century by Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai-based businessman and hotelier.The intricately carved figures of gods and goddesses, and desk items such as brush-washers and water-droppers, are mostly from the 18th or 19th centuries.Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, said the figures were “exquisite”. “They are of the greatest significance, they are documents of a vast culture and are therefore of the highest cultural value,” he said.The government is steering through parliament a ban on ivory sales that it says will be the strictest in the world. Exemptions in the legislation will allow museums to acquire historic ivory objects that have a cultural value.Asked whether accepting the Sassoon ivory sent the wrong message, Fischer said the museum “fully and unreservedly” supported banning the ivory trade worldwide. He pointed out that the collection was historic: “They exist... and they do not save any elephant’s life today.”The figures have been in the UK since the 1950s and looked after by a trust, whose members were keen to wind down the operation.Fischer said the museum would never collect modern ivory objects and believed there was a consensus that historic ivory objects needed to be preserved, not destroyed.The British Museum has one of the largest collections of ivory in the world, including the Lewis Chessmen and the Nimrud Ivories, artefacts excavated in the Middle East that are nearly 3,000 years old.Jane Portal, head of the museum’s Asia department, said the gift meant the institution could become “a global centre for the study of ivories”.The museum has not revealed the value of the collection. “They may be priceless or almost worthless in the future … who knows,” Portal said.The gift was announced in the British Museum’s annual review, which revealed it was visited by 5.8 million people in 2017-18, making it the UK’s leading visitor attraction for the 11th year running.The figure was down on the previous year’s 6.2 million visitors, but in line with a similar decline at London’s other big museums. This has been blamed on rail problems, fear of terrorism and the expense of London travel and restaurants.Fischer said the museum was working on “offers that will help bring these figures up again”.He said the museum lent a record 2,200 objects to 81 venues outside the UK last year and currently had eight touring shows, including in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.Strengthening links and activities in Africa would become a priority, Fischer said, as would improving the museum’s Bloomsbury home. “This fantastic building needs some tender loving care so this year we are developing a project to consider how to improve the building for our visitors and our staff and of course our collections.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0efd1d83066d67c6851253a24404b317d4678a84/0_277_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05857694272e27a88ba6028c69631609","title":"are englands trees disappearing","story":"The first national ‘tree champion’ is charged with reversing the fortunes of the country’s woodlands and beleaguered urban treesEngland is running out of oak. The last of the trees planted by the Victorians are now being harvested, and in the intervening century so few have been grown – and fewer still grown in the right conditions for making timber – that imports, mostly from the US and Europe, are the only answer.“We are now using the oaks our ancestors planted, and there has been no oak coming up to replace it,” says Mike Tustin, chartered forester at John Clegg and Co, the woodland arm of estate agents Strutt and Parker. “There is no oak left in England. There just is no more.” Earlier this month, the government appointed the first “tree champion”, who will spearhead its plans to grow 11 million new trees, and conserve existing forests and urban trees. Sir William Worsley, currently chairman of the National Forest Company, has been given the task of overseeing trees in England and Wales, including England’s iconic national tree, and ensuring that trees are not felled unnecessarily. Worsley is a former chief of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners and rural businesses.Trees were once fundamental to the British economy, from the days of Magna Carta, a large section of which concerned forestry rights, to the “Hearts of Oak” centuries of the empire-building Royal Navy, up to more recent times when millions of homes were needed, and the Forestry Commission was set up immediately after the first world war to grow the material to make them, while providing jobs for returning soldiers.Planting 11 million new trees, as well as 1 million in urban areas, may appear a tough target, but Tustin notes this would require just 4,400 hectares, compared with the 800 hectares currently planted annually. “It’s a drop in the ocean,” says Tustin.Timber prices have risen sharply in recent months, from about £45 a tonne last year to £65 to £70 a tonne at present. Forested land is a good investment, as owners need not pay inheritance tax or capital gains tax on commercial forests, and government grants are available to cover much of the average £3,500 per hectare cost of planting trees.However, forest owners planting native broad-leaf species for their amenity value, rather than for commercial timber, lose many of the tax benefits.Despite the government incentives, the rates of new forests being planted remain stubbornly low in England, where the high prices of land for farming and for housing development discourage tree-planting, as even the most popular commercial species such as Sitka spruce can take 30 to 50 years to reach maturity for harvesting.One of the first tasks Sir William Worsley will face is establishing the extent of the UK’s forests. John Tucker, director of outreach at the Woodland Trust, says there is little reliable information on how much land is covered by trees in the UK, and there are few protections even for ancient trees, on public or private land. “We are simply not collecting the data, we don’t know where we are,” he says. Without knowing the baseline of how many trees there are now, measuring progress will be impossible.Jeremy Barrell, director at Barrell Tree Consultancy, and a member of the Institute of Chartered Foresters, said: “There is strong anecdotal evidence and improving research evidence to confirm that urban canopy cover is declining around the world, and that is certainly my experience in Britain. Successive UK governments have failed to recognise the threat and act to reverse the adverse impact on ordinary people.”He said the appointment of a national tree champion was “the best chance there has ever been to formally recognise and introduce the importance of urban trees into mainstream built-environment management”.Worsley will also have to address the issues at Network Rail, which has been felling trees for the past decade as part of track management plans that will continue, in an £800m plan that will encompass all leaf-bearing trees on 20,000 miles of track. Jo Johnson, the rail minister, called a pause to the plans after the ’s revelations of tree-felling activities, but there is still no certainty over the long-term plans.Local authorities also face dilemmas, following protests in Sheffield over the felling of more than 6,000 trees there. Council members argued that the felling was needed as the trees posed a hazard to vehicles and pedestrians, but many local people objected. Cash-strapped councils must balance the amenity value of trees with the cost of maintaining them, and the potential insurance risks if they are found to contribute to accidents.

We’ve got welfare reform wrong in the past - how can we get it right in the future? “When it came to the crunch the retailers let us down,” says Ian Campbell. When he took over the running of a Norfolk farm in the early 1990s, pig farming was a successful, relatively healthy British sector.But within a few years a government ban on the use of gestation crates, combined with a rise in the value of the pound and a pig meat glut in Europe, would decimate the industry. The number of UK farmers would be nearly halved, while cheap meat from other countries with lower welfare requirements would come flooding in.As a report out this week calls for British farmers to be financially rewarded for high welfare, a vigorous debate is taking place around the future of our standards as we head towards Brexit. Will we hold on to them, and become a beacon for good practice as Michael Gove has promised? Will the need for a trade deal - any trade deal - trump that? Or will we find ourselves in the same place as twenty years ago, holding our own farmers to high standards while shoppers and retailers sneakily buy the cheap stuff? So what happened exactly when gestation crates were banned by our government in 1999? The crates were invented more than 50 years ago as a solution to preventing larger pigs taking food from smaller ones, enabling farmers to keep productivity higher. They became common in the US and Europe from the late 1960s onwards. But they were criticised by welfare groups for preventing the animals from properly moving and carrying out natural behaviours such as rooting. The idea of a ban was first floated in the early 1990s when campaign group Compassion in World Farming persuaded former MP Sir Richard Body to propose legislation to outlaw the practice of keeping pregnant sows in narrow stalls or chains throughout their pregnancies. The bill quickly picked up cross-party support from MPs, forcing the then-Conservative government to act.And to start with it looked like it was all going to be fine. Farmers put money into new facilities, and the big supermarkets started making it a requirement for farmers not to use the crates, remembers Ian Campbell. But with a rise in the value of the pound and a glut of pig meat in Europe, the retailers appeared to forget about the requirement, and began to import cheaper Dutch, Danish and German pig meat, where the animals continued to be confined. “Price was more important, so they didn’t stick with British producers at a time when we really needed them to,” says Campbell, who lost his processor contract as demand for British pig meat fell away. He was forced to sell his slaughtered pigs for half the price on the open market and the owners closed down the unit soon afterwards.It was the start of a “perfect storm” for the pig sector, says Stewart Houston, former chairman of the National Pig Association. Outbreaks of classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease further restricted sales of UK pigs. The ban had also coincided with an end to the practice of feeding meat and bonemeal – ie animal by-products – to omnivores after the BSE crisis in 1996. “It was the right thing to do, as it’s not acceptable to keep sows in stalls, but the problem was that it was done unilaterally,” says the editor of Pig World, Alistair Driver. “The line from the government at the time was that farmers would get a premium from the market for the higher standard.“But this didn’t materialise and what actually happened was that the big retailers continued to quite legally import pig meat from countries still using sow stalls,” he says.Across the rest of the EU, it was not until 2013 that a partial ban on the use of stalls was brought in, although it still allows pigs to be confined to inidual stalls for a further four weeks after being separated from piglets post-weaning. Meanwhile, producers in Brazil, Canada and in many US states are still allowed to keep sows in stalls their whole life.Some argue that pig farmers exaggerate the impact of the sow stall ban. Compassion in World Farming points out that it has benefited the UK sector in the long run by allowing it to position itself as a high-welfare producer. But it too sees the bigger problem. Defra cannot meet its promises to increase animal welfare while still promoting cheap food imports. “If we are going to have better welfare we have to make sure our farmers are not undermined, and be tougher in our trade negotiations post-Brexit,” says CIWF’s chief policy advisor, Peter Stevenson. He points to the example of a new ballot initiative in California that aims to ban the sale in California of pork from herds that use sow stalls.Non-EU member Switzerland also banned farrow crates and tail docking and has costs of production that are double those of neighbouring Germany, France and Austria. But their farmers are protected from imports and given payments for complying with high animal welfare standards.In an ideal world UK supermarkets would promise to only accept pig meat produced to higher standards (so far only the Co-op has done this), says Sandra Edwards, professor emerita at Newcastle University and leading pig welfare specialist. “People don’t want to absorb a detailed argument,” says Edwards. “When consumers are there in the shop and spending their money they don’t realise how their purchases can influence welfare standards. Most rely on retailers to take control. They just don’t want to think about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453355ae1f4bc28fe71b48f635551e9f525ff435/0_89_663_398/master/663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757f0f879c972abdf7b03f9d995b360a","title":"vagabond review agnes vardas sandrine bonnaire","story":"Revived to mark the director’s 90th birthday, the story of a young woman’s short, troubled life is cool, enigmatic and as gripping as any thrillerA young homeless woman is discovered dead in a freezing ditch by an agricultural worker. Pale and still undecomposed, she looks strangely peaceful, as if asleep, and in the mysterious and fractured drama to come, showing flashback episodes in her life descending to this grimly inevitable ending, she is often to be discovered sleeping rough in very much the same situation. As one witness says: “If they’re dead, it’s ugly if they’re asleep, it’s cute.”This is Mona, unforgettably played by Sandrine Bonnaire she has evidently changed her name from Justine, to distance herself from a former wage-slave life as a secretary. She took off on the road to nowhere with her tent on her back, sleeping in fields or roadsides, getting cash-in-hand jobs where she could, sometimes selling sex and sometimes getting raped: always defiant, faintly mutinous, seductive, uncaring, inscrutable. As she says: “Je m’en fous – je bouge” (“I don’t care – I move on”).She is the star of Agnès Varda’s award-winning 1985 film Vagabond, or Sans Toit Ni Loi (No Shelter No Law) now being revived as part of a retrospective in honour of the director’s 90th birthday. This extraordinary film-maker – part of that remarkable and long-lived New Wave generation – is still working, still creating, but this is surely one of her greatest films: enigmatic, possessed of a cool artistry in its structural asymmetries and inconsistencies, and as gripping as any thriller.Varda tells Mona’s story via testimonies of the various people she met: a technique that goes back to Citizen Kane and anticipates Carol Morley’s 2011 documentary Dreams of a Life, about the young woman who died in her London flat without anyone noticing for years. It is a story of someone who has effectively abandoned her identity as well as social status, an outsider, whose existence breaks cover in criminal acts. It reminded me of Rene Allio’s film of Moi, Pierre Rivière … or Cedric Kahn’s Roberto Succo. There is even something Balzacian in the rich spread of characters that Mona encounters.The film pieces together what happened. Sometimes the witnesses speak to an off-camera interviewer just before the relevant scene, sometimes they appear long afterwards, as if to offer an afterthought, and sometimes they will turn in the middle of an encounter with Mona, break the fourth wall and directly address the camera. There appears to be no strict rule or procedural logic in this, and the witnesses seem to have no connection with each other apart from their acquaintance with Mona. But then it appears some of them are related in unexpected ways, a middle-class mesh of prosperity extending horizontally over poor Mona’s head.Wherever she goes, Mona spreads unease. Very often, people secretly envy and admire her and feel discontented with themselves they are jealous of her freedom and think that for all her poverty she is really alive. But not everyone thinks this way. A hippy and his girlfriend take a shine to Mona and give her some land to work and a caravan to live in. But then they are deeply irritated and disappointed when Mona shows no inclination to get out of bed in the morning. This man tells her that, for all the romantic notions, life on the road, with its grinding poverty, is a kind of living death.Perhaps most complicated is Yolande (played by the Belgian character actor Yolande Moreau) who is maid to a rich old lady and whose uncle is the caretaker of her employer’s semi-derelict chateau. Yolande is one evening to discover Mona and a boyfriend asleep in this property, having broken in. She doesn’t inform on them, envying their happiness. They seem to her to be truly in love – in contrast to Yolande’s sullen relationship with her shifty, petty-criminal boyfriend. Yolande is fortuitously to encounter Mona again, and comes to feel very differently about her. Perhaps she can’t make up her mind whether she has an underdog bond with her, or if she is, in her heart, loyal to the ruling class.It is the chronicle of a death foretold. Perhaps the most arrestingly mysterious episode comes when a stylish university academic (Macha Méril) encounters Mona and winds up driving her around, disgusted by her smell and yet also fascinated by her. Later, this same woman is almost electrocuted in a freak accident after she puts both hands on a poorly fitted electric light. Badly shaken, she tells her nephew that she saw her life pass before her eyes. Perhaps, in some strange sense, like the workings of ine grace, it is Mona herself who has electrified this woman, made her take stock of her own existence.And so we watch Mona (or is it Justine?) stumble from place to place, from pointless guy to pointless guy. We have already seen her dead body. It makes her seem like a dead woman walking. But all these people she meets: aren’t they heading the same way? Aren’t they all dead people walking, talking, and training themselves not to think about the future? An unmissable film from this great director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2861270e4fc7aa6d831fe03f3a40cc4bcda2a3/0_41_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c05b0154902d007a1f30bfe92a81c41","title":"germany south korea world cup internet reacts","story":"The reigning champions lost to South Korea and finished bottom of their group.

A projected last-16 meeting with the nemesis of four years ago can now be safely placed away in the box of horrors.Brazil will instead travel south to Samara to play Mexico as Group E winners. And for all the triumphalism towards the end of this game – the cheers as they shuttled the ball around between some dogged, tiring Serbians – there will still be just a little unease about the latest generation to wear that heavy gold shirt.Brazil played well in phases here, their best moments when Philippe Coutinho controlled the tempo and combined with Neymar and Gabriel Jesus. But there were also periods where Brazil looked callow, lacking in presence in central midfield, where Nemanja Matic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic were able to dominate the space. The Spartak Stadium is a tight ground by the standards of this World Cup, clamped beneath the usual needlessly huge roof, a crown of vast grey tubing swooping around all four sides. On a steamy, close night in Moscow there was the usual din of horns and whistles, the distinct tone and texture of the Brazilian World Cup caravan.There was a tang of anxiety, too. Brazil have stuttered in patches at this tournament, and defeat would have sent them out at the group stage for the first time since Pelé was kicked around the fields of England. It was the team’s emotional state that had preoccupied the Brazilian press, the opening question at Tite’s press conference centring on exactly what degree of crying was acceptable, what were the official team blubbing guidelines.Brazil were unchanged and in yellow shirts again here, a wonderfully potent piece of World Cup iconography whatever the current virtues of those inside them. Serbia made three changes, Milos Veljkovic, Nikola Milenkovic and Adem Ljajic coming into a team that needed to win. And Serbia were brusque and powerful in the challenge, although Brazil’s early casualty, Marcelo, left the field unexpectedly complaining of illness, to be replaced by Filipe Luís.Serbia spread the red shirts across the full width of the pitch, looking to pile deep crosses in on Brazil’s under-sized full-backs. Matic and Milinkovic-Savic played close together in the middle and at times and simply walked through the yellow shirts in an angsty, bitty start for the five-times winners.Which Neymar would we see here after the paroxysms of St Petersburg? It is worth remembering Brazil’s No 10 remains in recovery, clawing his way back under the lens towards match sharpness. With 24 slow-burn minutes gone he produced his first little moment of grace, jinking around Milinkovic-Savic with a smattering of fairy steps, then combining in the tiniest of spaces with Gabriel Jesus to force a shot.Five minutes later the same combination should have made the opening goal. Neymar whipped a lovely long pass inside Antonio Rukavina. Jesus galloped in on goal, cut inside, then saw his right-footed shot blocked.Ljajic was booked for a trip on Neymar that drew a series of gymnastic rolls down the touchline, combined expertly with stricken shriek and waving arm. The opening goal was coming, Brazil’s central three beginning to snap together with a little more urgency.It arrived on 35 minutes, product of another ine intervention from Coutinho, arguably the midfielder of the tournament to date. Serbia had been closing his space near to goal, forcing Coutinho across the pitch on to his left foot. Finally he dropped deep and picked a dream of a pass over the top. Paulinho timed his run perfectly and got a toe to the ball as Vladimir Stojkovic rushed out.Brazil’s players celebrated with a prolonged 10-man huddle, drawing a few pointed words from Matic. And as Serbia trooped off the task looked ominous, with a need to press in search of two goals likely to leave Brazil with space for their lithe forward runners to exploit.Neymar should have killed the game 10 minutes into the half as Brazil did exactly that, breaking from a corner though Coutinho, who played a fizzed through pass to Neymar. He delayed. Stojkovic got down well to save.For a while Serbia began to assert their midfield strength. On the hour mark Alisson fumbled a low ball in from the right and saw the ball fall just out of reach of Aleksandar Mitrovic. Matic was dominating the centre, helped by the fact Brazil more or less leave that whole area to Casemiro and Paulinho, who were hustled by a crush of red shirts.Fernandinho came on with 25 minutes to play to help wrest back some control, and within three minutes it was 2-0. Mitrovic tried to cling to Miranda as Neymar’s corner came in but only succeeded in falling over at the near post. Thiago Silva filled the space and bulleted his header high into the net from four yards out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755b9d8f2712a22b97ab15d2c0245bfe5b47bee5/0_57_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8588c70fc10f3669b17e6085c2b6108","title":"south korea germany world cup group f match report","story":"This, then, is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. There are certain events so apocalyptic that it feels they cannot just happen. They should be signalled beneath thunderous skies as owls catch falcons and horses turn and eat themselves. At the very least there should be a sense of fury, of thwarted effort, of energies exhausted. And yet Germany went out of the World Cup in the first round for the first time in 80 years on a pleasantly sunny afternoon with barely a flicker of resistance. There was no Sturm. There was no Drang.Germany had come to this World Cup not merely as defending champions but also as winners of the last summer’s Confederations Cup – with what was in effect a second string. The overhaul of their academy system was the envy of the world, talent production on an industrial scale. And yet, called upon to score a goal against a disappointing South Korea side who had already lost to Sweden and Mexico, that had lost in qualifying to Qatar and China, they struggled to create a chance.In the end it was VAR that undid them, Kim Young-gwon’s shot that had initially been ruled out for offside given as a goal when it was realised the ball had been played to him by Toni Kroos. And then, even after that, there was a beautiful farce of a goal, Manuel Neuer caught in possession miles upfield as Son Heung-min chased on to Ju Se-jong’s long ball and rolled the ball into an empty net. It was as though football itself was having its joke, the sweeper-keeper who had been such an asset four years ago turned into a liability.Germany are the fourth of the last five world champions to go out in the group phase but this was as limp a defence as any side had managed. There was no defining defeat, as Spain had suffered to the Netherlands, just a whole load of baffling mundanity. There was a chance, three minutes from time, to steal a goal as they had stolen a late winner against Sweden in the second game but, presented with a free header eight yards out, Mats Hummels somehow misjudged his effort to the extent that the ball looped wide off his shoulder.Jogi Löw, the Germany coach, had acknowledged that while the Sweden game was an improvement, his side had still had problems in defensive transition, too often leaving the two central defenders exposed. His solution was to bring Leon Goretzka on to the right of the 4-2-3-1, while restoring Mesut Özil and Sami Khedira, who had both been left out of the win over the Swedes.It gives some indication of the difficulties Germany have had that only three outfielders started all three games. Thomas Müller, who has been struggling for form for a couple of years, was one of the latest sacrifices, the first time he had been left out of a tournament game by Germany since the semi-final of Euro 2012.Neuer has also started all three games despite not having played for Bayern since September, when he fractured a bone in a foot. He has not been his usual assured self either and 19 minutes in, he fumbled a free-kick from Jung Woo-Young before recovering to fist the ball away as Son closed in. To blame him would be absurd, but equally he is clearly far from his best, and in retrospect forcing him back ahead of Marc-André ter-Stegen was perhaps an error.But he was not the only one. Neuer’s uncertainty is part of a far greater whole. The German machine was gummed up here there was no fluency and little cohesion going forward. Perhaps the aim was simply to deny South Korea the counterattacking chances granted to Mexico and Sweden and in that at least, the gameplan was a success. The gegenpressing was more efficient, but then the opponent was weaker, and there was significant cost in terms of attacking threat.Not until Goretzka met a Joshua Kimmich cross with a flicked header three minutes into the second half was there a real sense of German threat. Cho Hyun-woo, though, leapt to his right to claw the ball away. The Daegu FC keeper came into the tournament as third choice before being surprisingly selected for the opening game because he is the tallest of the three keepers and the coach, Shin Tae-yong, was obsessed by Sweden’s height. Cho then gained a cult status in South Korea, where his extravagant ginger bouffant has earned him the nickname “Dae-hair”, taking the Korean word for “great” to create a pun on De Gea.Timo Werner volleyed wide soon after but that was a rare spasm of pressure. With news coming through that Sweden had scored and that Germany therefore needed to score, Löw threw on Mario Gomez and then Müller. Immediately those issues in defending against the counter returned and a more incisive side than South Korea would have taken advantage. It could, in truth, have been much worse, and over much sooner. But for Kroos’s brilliant late goal against Sweden, it would have been over a game ago.In Brazil four years ago Germany struggled to get the balance right between attack and defence until the quarter-final. This time they never quite did and so, inevitably, unresisted, twilight fell upon the gods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0ac841a782b656b375ec6a0eeda62c8794c6c5/0_111_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb912618cc76c48efc432140ad042c9","title":"ticketless fans russia world cup ids","story":"The Football Supporters’ Federation said it hoped a loophole exposed in the Russian security service’s Fan ID system would encourage England fans without tickets to travel to Russia in support of Gareth Southgate’s side.Fan IDs are being given to all supporters who have tickets to World Cup matches to allow them visa-free entry into the country. But the FSF managed to obtain a number of Fan\u0026nbspIDs using the same ticket reference number, in effect beating the system and allowing in even those without tickets.Fifa said data protection regulations prevented it from sharing with Russian authorities the details of fans who had bought tickets with the Russian authorities, which has resulted in a certain laxity in the system.Kevin Miles, chief executive of the FSF, hopes the loophole will encourage more supporters to fly to Russia for the knockout stages. “You can have a great time at the World Cup without a ticket The experience of the fans who have been out in Russia is clearly at variance with what the expectations of a lot of people had been before the tournament.”The reason Fan IDs do not require a match ticket is because details from the sales system are not shared by Fifa with the Russian government because of data protection regulations. “In line with such policies Fifa doesn’t transfer any personal data of ticket customers to the Ministry of Mass Communications,” Fifa said in a statement. “Any personal data used in connection with the issuance of Fan IDs is collected and stored by the ministry itself without any involvement from Fifa. Fifa solely provides the ministry with ticket application IDs in an anonymised procedure, thus not sharing any personal data with the ministry.”Authorities in Finland have intercepted a group of migrants with Fan IDs trying to enter the country, apparently after using Russia as a staging point on their journey to the European Union.

Mexico will have a go in the next round.90+3 min: Wonderful interplay between Jesus and Neymar, but Neymar is foiled by Stojkovic. 90+2 min: Zivkovic cuts in from the right and lets fly from the corner of the box. He strikes it hard and wild. 90 min: There will be at least three more minutes before Serbia head for the airport89 min: Fernandinho feeds Neymar again, this time without the aid of a deflection. Neymars gets off one shot that is saved and then fights for another but this engulfed by three defenders. Fernandinho has been excellent since his arrival. 88 min: Switzerland are now leading 2-1 against Costa Rica but that does not change the standings in the group. 86 min: A clipped pass from Fernandinho rebounds off Zivkovic and into the path of Neymar, who tries to lift the ball over the bar. But Stojkovic does well to bat it away. 84 min: There will be no comeback here. Brazil are squeezing the life out of Serbia and enjoying it. They’ve been superior, no doubt: sharp, strong and creative.82 min: A long ball from the back finds Willian running down the right.

The fight seems to have gone out of Serbia, but that doesn’t mean some smart arse isn’t going to get a boot.72 min: Brazil are pressing for a third here. It seems that bout of pressure from Serbia only served to annoy the Brazilians. Serbia, then, did a a David Narey, as they say in Scotland.70 min: Neymar brings the crowd to their feet, squealing, with a loping 50-yard run down the left. Then he serves Coutinho near the edge of the area. The ex-Liverpool man shimmies to create room for a shot and then lets fly. But his effort is deflected behind for a corner. That’s torn it for Serbia! Just as they were threatening to get back into the game, Brazil zip forward and wins a couple of corner. Neymar curls the second one into the near post and Thiago Silva heads into the net from six yards!Brazil substitution: Fernandinho on, Paulinho off. That’s an attempt by Tite to tighten up central midfield, where Serbia are finding gaps as they please.65 min: Rukavina hangs up a delightful cross from the right. Mitrovic towers above Fagner at the far post and sends a powerful downward header ... into the arms of Allison! Again, a touch more to one of the sides and a goal was the most likely outcome. 63 min: Super from Serbia!

Serbia aren’t done yet!61 min: Tadic makes a break down the left. Rukavina fires a tantalising low ball into the box. Allison makes a mess of it, parrying it to Mitrovic seven yards out, right in front of goal! Mitrovic’s ing header ... hits a defender standing two yards out! What a chance! If Mitrovic had put his header towards either corner it was an equaliser, for sure. 59 min: Costa Rica have equalised against Switzerland but the Swiss are still going through unless Serbia find two goals here - and avoid conceding any more.57 min: Brilliant break by Brazil! Willian feeds Coutinho with a smart header. Coutinho collects the ball near the half-way line and plays a fine pass into the path of Neymar, who’s running into the left-hand side of the box, with Tadic straining to keep pace. Neymar takes a superfluous touch before shooting - and that may have given Stojkovic the chance he needed to set up himself and make the save. 56 min: That’s better from Ljajic! A vicious pass into the box that forces Miranda to ert it over his own bar from close range! 54 min: Milinkov-Savic wins the ball in midfield and helps it on to Ljajic, who scurries forward from half-way. Serbia have a three-on-two situation! Once he reaches the cusp of the Brazilian box, Ljajic draws a defender and aims a pass towards Tadic, who in support to his right. But Ljajic’s pass is behind the winger, forcing him to do an about-turn and allowing Brazil to regroup and clear.53 min: William performs that exquisite quick shuffle of the feet of his, making space for a cross, which he booms low into the six-yard box. Vejkovic does well to whack it away from right in front of his goal.52 min: Casemiro ks a ball from the right touchline all the way over to Neymar on the left. Neymar takes it down without fuss and Brazil continue probing...49 min: Matic booked for bringing down his Mancunian neighbour Jesus near half-way. Matic will miss the next match, if Serbia have another one in this tournament.47 min: A lubberly foul by Miranda on Mitrovic gives Serbia a freekick half-way inside the Brazilian half. And in the time it took me to write that, the ball has been sent back up the other end and is now in the arms of Stojkoic. Fair to say Serbia did not make the most of that. “I take it back, Neymar did not make a meal of that by Neymar’s standards,” admits Matt Cast. “Using the same yardstick, Rivaldo’s reaction in 2002 was perfectly proportional (oh look, another player who learnt a lot at Barcelona).”46 min: Here we go again, as Whitesnake almost sang. Several - make that, dozens - of emailers have asked me to revise my view that Neymar did not make a meal of the Ljajic foul on him in the 32nd minute. But I maintain that a somersault followed by a quick lie-down is merely an hors d’oeuvre by Neymar’s standards. And there were no tears. Brazil deserve their lead, which came courtesy of a well constructed and executed goal by Paulinho. Coutinho’s pass to him was a beauty, as was one that Neymar made to Jesus for another chance a few minutes prior to the goal. Serbia, despite holding their own for periods, have yet to show that sort of quality. They’ll likely need to do so if they are to find the two goals they need to stay at the World Cup. Mitrovic has generally been well contained by Brazil’s centreback so far. Back soon!44 min: Milkinkovic-Savic wins the ball in his own half, carries it 20 yards forward and then wins a freekick. But Serbia make nothing of it.43 min: Tadic pulls Neymar back by the shoulder near half-way. Freekick to Brazil, once Neymar stops clutching his eye and gets back to his feet.42 min: Another Serbian corner. Another one dealt with well by Brazil, this time Casemiro.40 min: Ljajic curls a wicked corner in on top of Allison. Mitrovic pronks in the direction of the keeper but Allison holds his nerve, keeps his eye on the ball and punches clear. 39 min: Serbia build a good attack down the left before Kolarov bangs over a decent cross. It’s nodded behind for a corner.36 min: Serbia need to score twice now or they are going home. Their attempt to do so will surely leave more gaps for Brazil to exploit. They’re in a proper pickle.Coutinho spots a tremendous run from deep by Paulinho and clips the perfect pass through to him. The keeper charges out but Paulinho gets there first and pokes the bouncing ball over him and into the net! 34 min: Tadic pulls a cross back from the left-hand byline. Mitrovic, arcing back, ties to hook a left-foot volley goalward from nine yards. He hoiks it over the bar.

Thanks for your company, goodnight!In the other Group E game, Brazil did the necessary against Serbia and will face Mexico in the last 16 on Monday afternoon.That was a lively, engaging game of football, even if it was apparent early on that the result was unlikely to matter. Costa Rica were terrific and deserved at least a point. Switzerland got what they came for – a point that confirms their place in the last 16. They will face Sweden on Tuesday.Bryan Ruiz, with what is almost certainly his last kick at a World Cup, steps up - and he scores! Well, kind of. The penalty hit the underside of the bar, rebounded onto the back of Sommer and into the net. It’ll go down as an own goal.90+2 min This referee seems determined to give Costa Rica a penalty. Campbell goes over after a challenge from Zakaria and a penalty is given. It’s a bit soft, that - if anything Campbell fouled Zakaria.90+1 min When it comes to offsides, VAR has worked almost perfectly. The rest of it, not so much.Yes, the decision has been overturned. I’m not sure it was a foul either.90 min Waston was also booked for shoving the referee from behind as he appealed for a penalty. I think the decision is going to be overturned because Bryan Ruiz was offside when he received the ball in the aea.89 min Bryan Ruiz goes down in the area and the referee gives a penalty. It looked a bit soft but we haven’t seen a replay.That was a fine finish. Zakaria played a low ball into the box from the right, and when Acosta slipped it allowed Drmic to run onto the ball and curl a classy first-time shot into the corner.Josep Drmic has won it for Switzerland!87 min “Rodney Wallace coming on,” says Rachel Clifton, “is giving me some severe Southampton nostalgia.”Wait till you see Colombia’s rugged right-winger, Tommy Widdrington.86 min “Thanks, Karl Lindgren, for including the Netherlands among the giants,” says Jan Karremans. “But that’s too much honor for us, these days.”84 min Borges’s cross is headed away superbly under pressure by Lichtsteiner, who is clattered by Wallace in the process. That was great defending.83 min Schar is booked for pulling back the superb Campbell. It’s a slightly harsh booking, which means he’ll also miss the Sweden game in the last 16.81 min Switzerland make their final change, with Michael Lang replacing Xherdan Shaqiri. And Costa Rica bring on Rodney Wallace for the excellent Daniel Colindres.79 min After a terrific, shambling run from Campbell, Borges’s fierce strike is beaten away by Sommer.78 min Drmic hits the post! It was a thumping header from Embolo’s flat cross, and it clattered off the top of the post before Navas had chance to e.77 min “Dear Rob,” says Karl Lindgren. “Sweden are a bit of an enigma. They are ranked number 23, with no transcendent stars and no strikers to speak of – an average also-ran if there ever was one. Yet, what team has slain more giants on the way to the 16 than the Ssons? Netherlands, Italy, Germany – yes, I am aware they lost to Germany... give an expat Swede a break!”With the way the draw is, they could get to the semis. They are so solid defensively. It wouldn’t surprise me if they beat Switzerland and then took Belgium or England to penalties in the quarters.75 min Zakaria is booked for pulling back Gamboa.73 min The match is petering out now. I don’t know what else to say, because there’s nothing of note to report. 70 min Brazil have gone 2-0 up against Serbia. That means Switzerland are going through to the last 16, where they will almost certainly meet Sweden.69 min Another Switzerland change: Mario Gavranovic is replaced by Josip Drmic.68 min Nothing much to report. Costa Rica are still pushing hard for a consolation victory Switzerland are experiencing the age-old sticktwist dilemma.64 min Costa Rica look the likelier winners. Switzerland have been a bit pedestrian going forward for most of the game.60 min An unexpected feature of this tournament has been rousing farewell performances from teams who have already been eliminated: Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica, Peru and of course Korea. I know Korea could technically have gone through today but it was pretty unlikely.57 min There’s no need for Switzerland to worry just yet – they only need a draw to go through, and even a defeat will be fine if Brazil maintain their lead against Serbia.Kendall Waston scores Costa Rica’s first goal of the tournament! Campbell swerved a right-wing corner towards the six-yard line, where Waston shoved Akanji aside and flicked an accomplished header into the corner. 54 min Campbell’s cross is nodded down smartly by Colindres for Oviedo, who lashes the bouncing ball over the bar. It wouldn’t come down quickly enough for him. It was another lovely move, though. Costa Rica have played some really neat attacking football.52 min Shaqiri plays a superb angled pass into the area to find Embolo, whose shot from a very tight angle is beaten away by Navas.50 min As things stand, Switzerland will play Sweden in the last 16 on Tuesday.49 min Rodriguez wallops a fine shot just over the bar from 25 yards.48 min Campbell misses an excellent chance to equalise! A corner was only half cleared and dumped back into the area by Borges. It was dummied cleverly by Waston, allowing it to run to Campbell, but he sliced it well wide on the half-volley.47 min Oviedo is lucky not to be booked for a kick at Shaqiri.47 min “Was there another keeper as physically imposing yet capable of the darndest feline-like acrobatics as Schmeichel?” says Phil Podolsky. “Besides Neuer, I mean, whose howler doesn’t mean he is suddenly not the best in the world.” I can’t think of anyone, no. He really was an elastic beast. 46 min Peep peep! Costa Rica begin the second half.Peep peep! Despite a torrid start to the match, this dogged Switzerland side are on course for the last 16. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.42 min A neat move from Costa Rica. Ruiz feeds an excellent pass into Campbell, who moves it across to Colindres. He has a great chance to play in Borges on the right of the area, but he overhits the pass.41 min Costa Rica have faded a little after that terrific start. Switzerland have them under control at the moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03badbb508534c1aa58a4de8d087ce1abbd99612/0_434_7943_4767/master/7943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036c9ec9fdaeb0aaed60a83be2c3ed2e","title":"nicholas balfe recipe tomato anchovy bread salad","story":"This deliciously simple recipe takes four key components and adds an extra umami oomph for a perfect balance of flavoursGood bread, ripe tomatoes, olive oil, sea salt.

May has agreed to address the leaders at a dinner on Thursday night after discussions with Donald Tusk, the European council president, earlier this week in Downing Street.She is expected to sketch out her intentions for the coming few weeks before they come to their conclusions on the state of the negotiations the following morning.Asked whether Tusk was more confident about the future following his last meeting with May, a senior EU official laughed, adding: “Well, I don’t think he is less optimistic.”On the so-called backstop solution for the Irish border – a default state to be in place until a free trade deal or bespoke technological solution is agreed – the official said there had “frankly been no progress, and that’s reason to express concern”.He said: “I think that is why they have agreed with Theresa May that it would be useful for the prime minister of the United Kingdom to sketch out the intention of the UK government in the weeks to come.”May is convening a meeting of her cabinet at Chequers on Friday, where she hopes to find agreement among her squabbling ministers on a white paper on the future EU-UK relationship, to be published the following week.One senior diplomat attached to a member state embassy in Brussels said: “We are hoping to hear from her that she is leaving behind her red-lines and bringing forward a credible paper. A credible paper would be something as close as possible to the present situation. The other options are also credible but they are not very nice.“Some of the red lines that have been in her speeches have made it very difficult to come to a trading relationship close to the present situation.”Spain has also expressed its concern that an agreement has yet to be struck with the UK over the future of Gibraltar. However the failure of the UK to live up to its promise in the December joint report on a solution to the Irish border remains the issue most likely to upend the talks.Arriving in Brussels, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, described the lack of progress as “very disappointing”, and that Dublin was intensifying work on its contingency plans. “I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations … need to intensify. Preparations and contingency planning continue in Ireland and are intensifying for all outcomes.” A French government source said they were preparing for all scenarios, but that Friday’s message was serious. This is the last summit before October when, theoretically at least, the withdrawal treaty should be decided. If not, it will be a big problem, the source said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22d7cc00110b373eaa9b8c62c64ce4d399f8befa/9_5_2574_1545/master/2574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=556372c2cdefd52ff77b79813038976a","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn may business brexit","story":"The Labour leader had a few nice lines – ‘no deal is a bad deal’ – but PM was unflusteredJeremy Corbyn joined Theresa May in paying tribute to the armed forces and said more should be done for veterans.On Brexit, he said Greg Clark, the business secretary, thought business was entitled to be listened to with respect. Boris Johnson had taken a different view, using an Anglo-Saxon term. What was May’s view?May said her government had always backed businesses. They were the backbone of UK prosperity. She said Corbyn must decide whether to back business or overthrow capitalism – he couldn’t do both.Corbyn said he took that as May rejecting Johnson’s approach. Airbus supported 110,000 jobs in the UK, many well-paid and unionised. The company had said leaving the EU without a deal would make it reconsider its UK investments. Would May take the phoney threat of no deal off the table?May said if Corbyn was that bothered about the aerospace industry, he should have backed Heathrow expansion. She said she did not normally agree with Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, but on this she did. McCluskey had said backing Heathrow expansion would ensure the UK remains a world leader in aerospace.Corbyn said Johnson did not back Heathrow either. But he had done his bit for the industry by spending 14 hours on a plane for a 10-minute meeting.He quoted the head of BMW, which employs 8,000 people in Britain, who said that without clarity on the customs plan, the company would have to implement contingency plans. Corbyn asked May how many more firms were telling her in private what Airbus and BMW were saying publicly?Corbyn said Jacob Rees-Mogg was relocating his hedge fund to Dublin, while John Redwood was advising people not to invest in the UK. Would May ignore Johnson, listen to workers and get an agreement that safeguarded jobs?May said she was putting jobs at the heart of what she was doing. She said Corbyn had been a Brexiter himself for most of his career, so why was he trying to frustrate Brexit?Corbyn said Labour’s priority was protecting jobs. He quoted a Honda employee as saying May would be responsible if his job was put at risk. Did Andrea Leadsom speak for the government when she said the customs partnership plan was unwieldy?May said the government was looking at the customs partnership as well as maximum facilitation. Corbyn had said Labour’s priority was delivering jobs, so why did every Labour government leave office with higher unemployment?Corbyn said that was rich from someone presiding over an economy with 1 million people on zero-hours contracts. He said the only customs option acceptable to the government was a no deal. He said May continued to promote the fallacy that no deal was better than a bad deal. But no deal was a bad deal, he said. The real risk to jobs was a prime minister who was having to negotiate with her cabinet to stop it falling apart instead of negotiating for jobs.May said she could summarise what the government was achieving, and she rattled off a list. Britain would leave the EU on 29 March 2019, she said.Wasn’t the real risk to jobs in the UK a prime minister who had to negotiate around the clock with her own cabinet, Corbyn asked.May offered a list: successor to Trident, stamp duty cuts, fairer schools funding, record levels of employment, falling borrowing, rising real wages …Often at PMQs, as David Cameron explains well in a recent book, the open goals turn out to be the hardest ones. Corbyn arrived in the chamber after an abundance of headlines about government disarray. But despite some perfectly good questions, he never really threw May off her stride and it felt very much like an uninspiring draw.As usual, Corbyn’s problem was his failure to come back with a good follow-up. It was obvious that May would respond to his first question by saying she backed business, but instead of coming back with evidence to rubbish this, he moved on to another (in itself, perfectly sound) question, about a no-deal Brexit.She sidestepped that question completely, but Corbyn did not pursue the topic. He had a good line on no deal at the end – no deal is a bad deal – but at no point did his line of questioning ever particularly discomfort May. Later, Labour’s Mary Creagh gave a good example of how it can be done, telling May that Johnson’s comment expressed pithily what Brexit would do for business.May was uninspiring, and eager to change the subject at every opportunity. Her claim that Labour was doing everything it could in the Commons to frustrate Brexit will be a mystery to some who have followed the votes. But she stumbled through it all with the usual stolid fortitude. It was all very forgettable.He has raised the question of Airbus if he is so concerned about our aerospace and aviation industry, why did he not back the expansion of Heathrow?Jeremy Corbyn, in response:Well, the foreign secretary did not back it either, but in his own way was helping the aviation industry by spending 14 hours in a plane for a 10-minute meeting in Afghanistan.

But do speak out and make yourself heard … Your actual experience needs to be heard in this debate”.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, repeatedly mocked the cabinet splits and indecision at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, saying May was putting jobs at risk.With less than a month before parliament breaks up for the summer recess, Downing Street is preparing a fresh push to unite ministers around a Brexit negotiating position, which will be fleshed out in a white paper expected to run to more than 130 pages.Whitehall sources say May is increasingly leaning towards a Norway-style approach, that would involve accepting single market membership, at least for goods, while Brexiters are continuing to push for a much looser, Canada-type trade deal.Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe, said the government was slowly realising that its hopes for a bespoke relationship are unrealistic – particularly with time so short. However, both of the options left on the table are deeply problematic for the prime minister.May would also have to sell it to the EU. Brussels is adamant the single market is inisible, and membership for some sectors would be “cherrypicking”.But senior negotiators believe they have picked up more positive signals from EU governments keen to avoid trade disruption. May will meet a series of EU27 leaders in the next seven days, beginning on the sidelines of the European council in Brussels, to seek to win them over.Domestically, Clark is increasingly becoming the champion of the softest possible Brexit. He has recently visited the Irish border and the NorwaySweden border to understand the risks for trade. “He’s seen it it in real life and he’s been affected by what he saw,” said a source close to the business secretary.A senior Tory source said: “He’s accepted the fact that we’re leaving the single market and the customs union. He accepts that’s the political and legal statement we have to make and that’s the starting point. We’re trying to find ways of minimising disruption – linguistic ways of protecting vestiges of seamless movement for example, for the movement of parts for planes. It’s a very fine linguistic tightrope, as well as a political one.”Both options for future customs arrangements – including the Brexiters’ favoured “max fac” approach – are expected to appear in the white paper.Brexiters say they are relaxed about drafts of the paper already circulating in Whitehall. “There isn’t a white paper as such,” said a senior government source. “There’s lots of drafts and comments on drafts, and they can change until the last possible moment”.May’s decision to summon the entire cabinet to Chequers, not just her deadlocked Brexit subcommittee, is causing anxiety among leavers. “They’re stacking the deck to make sure they’ve got the numbers in the room,” said one senior government Brexiter.At Thursday’s summit, expected to be dominated by the migration issue, May will also urge the EU to work closely with the UK on security, including by coordinating responses to Russia and other hostile states.She is expected to say: “Russia and other actors seem to be trying to sow disunity, destabilise our democracies and test our resolve. We must adapt our current defences to the new normal and take responsibility for protecting international norms and institutions.”She will urge her colleagues to roll over the sanctions against Russia introduced after the conflict in Crimea and to share the names of the Russian diplomats expelled after the Skripal poisoning, so that they are not readmitted to other EU countries."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists develop thermal camouflage that can fool infrared cameras","story":"Invention can make an object appear to have the same temperature as its backgroundScientists have developed a thin, lightweight and flexible film that can outfox infrared cameras, allowing hot bodies to appear cool and cold items to appear warm. The invention can also help camouflage an object by making it appear the same temperature as its background.The design was inspired by the colour-shifting capabilities of cuttlefish, says Coskun Kocabas, a co-author of the research from the University of Manchester.The approach involves using electricity to alter the properties of the film, so that it changes from acting more like a “black body” – which absorbs and emits electromagnetic radiation but does not reflect it – to becoming more like a metal, which reflects radiation but is not good at absorbing or emitting it.Kocabas said the film could have a number of uses. “One obvious application is of course camouflage, but the novelty in this is it is adaptive camouflage,” he said, adding it could also be useful for covering radiators on satellites, allowing them to be tweaked to reflect heat when facing the sun and emit excess heat when facing deep space.Writing in the journal Nano Letters, Kocabas and colleagues in the US and Turkey reveal how they created the material using a stack made of nylon, gold, polyethylene soaked in a liquid composed of charged molecules, and multiple layers of graphene.Graphene, a honeycomb sheet of carbon one atom thick that has been dubbed a “wonder material”, is very good at emitting heat in the form of radiation. As a result, when the device is rested on a person’s hand, the heat it gains from the hand is emitted as infrared light, meaning that when a thermal camera is pointed at the device, an image of the person’s hand can be seen.But there’s a twist. The team found that when a voltage was applied across the device, the charged molecules in the polyethylene layer became incorporated within the graphene layers. That, they found, reduced the level of infrared light the graphene could emit.As a result, when the team applied three volts to the device, the image of the person’s hand could no longer be seen when the device was viewed through the infrared camera. The team then set up a sensor to measure the changing temperature of a surface, and used that information, via an algorithm, to adjust the voltage applied to the device – which itself was kept at a constant temperature.As a result, they were able to change the apparent warmth of the device as seen through an infrared camera, allowing it thermally blend into the surface in less than five seconds, even though its actual temperature did not change. The team say the system can currently work between temperatures of 25C and 38C.Further work revealed that incorporation of the charged molecules into the graphene doesn’t just affect the device’s ability to emit infrared light – it also changes how reflective the device is.The team found when the device itself is kept at a temperature hotter than its surroundings, increasing the voltage decreases the apparent temperature of the device. That is because the device is now less able to emit infrared light and, although it is now more reflective, there is little infrared light to reflect. However, Kocabas said, when the device is kept cooler than the surroundings and a voltage is applied, the device appears warmer than it really is because there is now more infrared light to reflect from its surroundings.

But quite what the cigar-shaped interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is has remained something of a mystery. Now research suggests it is a comet in disguise.Named after the Hawaiian for messenger or scout – a nod to the fact it was initially spotted by researchers working at the Pan-Starrs telescope in Hawaii in October – ‘Oumuamua was quickly revealed to be a visitor from another solar system, making it the first known interstellar object to swing through our neighbourhood.Scientists soon scotched ideas that it could be an alien spacecraft: despite having a shape akin to Battlestar Galactica, ‘Oumuamua showed no signs of radio signals and was found to be tumbling through space. It was subsequently discovered to be an object about 10 times as long as it is wide, and dark red in colour – likely down to the impact of cosmic radiation on a surface of frozen, carbon-based substances.But it remained unclear whether the object was an asteroid, a comet or something else. Although initially thought to be a comet, when ‘Oumuamua hurtled past the sun there was no sign of the gas and dust typically released as such icy bodies heat up. That said, some have suggested that the object’s coating of “organic gunk” might have prevented heat from the sun reaching any ice lying beneath. With scientists puzzled, ‘Oumuamua was classed as an asteroid, and then when its origins were discovered it was relabelled as the first in the new class of “interstellar objects”.Now scientists say that as well as this designation, ‘Oumuamua might be a comet after all.Writing in the journal Nature, an international team of researchers reveal how they came to the conclusion by studying the path of ‘Oumuamua through to early January. When the team analysed the observations, they found the path could not be explained solely by the influence of the Sun, moon, planets and other large objects in the solar system. Instead they discovered another form of acceleration, not linked to gravity, also appears to be at play.While the team offer a number of possibilities, including that this acceleration is down to pressure from solar radiation, they say the most plausible explanation is “outgassing”: in other words, ‘Oumuamua is partly propelled by the loss of water vapour and other gases, but at levels that would not be detected by instruments.“We analysed other possible explanations in detail, and each of them turned out not to work, either because the effect was too weak, or because its behaviour did not match the data,” said Micheli.The team say ‘Oumuamua is likely also losing dust, but suggest a number of reasons why that hasn’t been spotted, including that the grains might be too small to be detected, or that there is not much dust present relative to the amount of ice.But our interstellar visitor is only making a flying visit: it is already further away from the Sun than Jupiter is, and is heading out of the solar system. “It will reach the distance of Saturn in early 2019,” added Micheli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c/0_51_5695_3417/master/5695.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5c6501a8f802517bb44df07eabbdb9b","title":"space is full of dirty toxic grease scientists reveal","story":"Research to calculate amount of ‘space grease’ in the Milky Way found enough for 40 trillion trillion trillion packs of butterIt looks cold, dark and empty, but astronomers have revealed that interstellar space is permeated with a fine mist of grease-like molecules.The study provides the most precise estimate yet of the amount of “space grease” in the Milky Way, by recreating the carbon-based compounds in the laboratory. The Australian-Turkish team discovered more than expected: 10 billion trillion trillion tonnes of gloop, or enough for 40 trillion trillion trillion packs of butter.Prof Tim Schmidt, a chemist at the University of New South Wales, Sydney and co-author of the study, said that the windscreen of a future spaceship travelling through interstellar space might be expected to get a sticky coating. “Amongst other stuff it’ll run into is interstellar dust, which is partly grease, partly soot and partly silicates like sand,” he said, adding that the grease is swept away within our own solar system by the solar wind.The findings bring scientists closer to figuring out the total amount of carbon in interstellar space, which fuels the formation of stars, planets and is essential for life. Until now there has been uncertainty over how much carbon is drifting between the stars. About half is expected to be found in its pure form. The rest is chemically bound with hydrogen in either a grease-like form, known as aliphatic carbon, or as a gaseous version of naphthalene, the main chemical component of mothballs.To tackle the question, Schmidt and colleagues recreated in the laboratory the process by which greasy carbon forms in the outflows of carbon stars. The material was collected and analysed using spectroscopy to work out how strongly it absorbed light of certain wavelengths. “This allowed us to figure out how much greasy carbon is in the line of sight of various stars,” said Schmidt.They found that there are about 100 greasy carbon atoms for every million hydrogen atoms, accounting for between a quarter and a half of the available carbon in the Milky Way.“This space grease is not the kind of thing you’d want to spread on a slice of toast,” said Schmidt. “It’s dirty, likely toxic and only forms in the environment of interstellar space – and our laboratory.”The team now plans to determine the abundance of the mothball-like carbon, which will involve more laboratory experiments. By firmly establishing the amount of each type of carbon in the dust, they will know precisely how much of this element is available to create life. “It’s part of understanding the great life-cycle of carbon,” said Schmidt. “It’s made in stars, goes through the interstellar medium and gets incorporated into new planetary systems and has ended up incorporated into life. It’s part of the big story, the biggest story there is.”Helen Fraser, a senior lecturer in astronomy at the Open University, said: “It remains a major question in astronomy how dust forms, evolves and is destroyed.”Fraser said the work suggests that are many more “grease-like” molecules in space than previously thought. “The consequence could be important in how such dust grains stick and form planets, or even ‘seed’ planetary surfaces with the ingredients for the origins of life,” she added.The findings were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa734445ab305de1072335fd6268ceaaed7bb58/109_51_1099_659/master/1099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9dfc5ea83c24fde48b0eab574f01e85","title":"doing her best doctor criticised in gosport inquiry responds","story":"Jane Barton, who overprescribed opiates, said she was ‘a hard-working’ doctorJane Barton, the doctor at the centre of the Gosport hospital scandal in which the lives of up to 600 people were cut short by powerful painkillers, has said she had been “a hard-working” doctor doing her best in an under-resourced part of the NHS.It was her first public comment since an inquiry found last week that patients’ lives had been shortened by inappropriate doses of painkillers at the Gosport War Memorial hospital in Hampshire.Barton was a GP running two wards where frail and elderly people were admitted, often for rehabilitation. Many who were not in pain ended up on syringe drivers that pumped what the panel said were inappropriately administered powerful opiate painkillers, such as doses of diamorphine and other drugs, into their bodies. Barton was said to have been responsible for overseeing prescribing on the wards. The families of patients have fought for 20 years for answers.The Gosport panel, led by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones, found that overprescription of opioids had been institutional and routine. The report was critical of Barton and also of the consultants, the nurses who administered the drugs, and the pharmacist who dispensed them. It also criticised NHS management, Department of Health staff and ministers for failing to help the families.Barton appeared outside her Gosport home with her husband, Tim, who read a statement. He said: “Jane would like to thank her family, friends, colleagues, former patients and many others for their continued support and loyalty through this protracted inquiry. She has always maintained that she was a hard-working doctor doing her best for her patients in a very inadequately resourced part of the health service.”The deaths of more than 90 patients have been investigated by Hampshire police, but charges have never been brought against anyone at the hospital. Barton was brought before a disciplinary tribunal of the General Medical Council, the doctors’ regulatory body, and found guilty of serious professional misconduct over her prescribing and failure to make adequate notes, but she was not struck off the register. She then retired as a doctor.Many families still want to see criminal prosecutions for the deaths of their loved ones. In a statement apologising to them for what happened, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, asked the Crown Prosecution Service to look again and suggested that another police force, not Hampshire, should investigate.There have been claims that the use of two types of syringe driver in the NHS that could easily be confused, one of which delivered a dose within minutes that should be given over 24 hours, was to blame for the deaths. The panel has denied that, pointing out that the report showed the very high doses prescribed were to blame – whichever syringe driver was used."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab14f175ebdf5d3f8cf66fc2fd2560703a30aeb/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411a5c510326fc2f5370de31bff99f0d","title":"england australia twenty20 international match report","story":"• England 221-5 Australia 193• England win one-off Twenty20 international by 28 runsAustralia will depart these shores with six defeats from six after a one-off Twenty20 in which England reproduced the dominance of the whitewashed one-day series. Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid were their tormentors once more.The former’s 30-ball 61 – including England’s fastest half-century in the format from 22 balls – was the rocket-fuelled start to a total of 221 for five, their highest ever at home. Rashid’s subsequent three for 27, including Aaron Finch for 81 when the opener was threatening a fightback, saw the tourists bowled out for 193 with two balls to spare.This was cracking day in leafy south Birmingham. The bars had been open all afternoon, the pitch was a belter, the boundaries short and England had indeed gone for a meaty top six spearheaded by Buttler at the top alongside Jason Roy. Australia won the sixth successive toss on this tour and Finch, captain here, fancied an early look at the pair.What followed was burned on to his retina a 98-run opening stand from just 8.5 overs, first led by Roy piercing the infield three times in Billy Stanlake’s initial over before Buttler began raining down blows as six fours and five sixes flew from his blade.Kane Richardson won’t forget his part in the opening stanza, having been taken for 23 in his first over (amid figures of none for 59) and then grassing a simple catch at long-on to give Roy a life on 27. Edgbaston, it can be confirmed, still enjoys an Australian in such strife, as shown when Buttler chipped the next ball off Ashton Agar over his head for four.Mitchell Swepson copped some too when a wild throw went for four overthrows. But the leg-spinner did have some joy on debut, getting Buttler in the ninth over and the surprise No 3, Eoin Morgan, in the 12th. With Stanlake inflicting revenge on Roy in between – a searing bouncer was top-edged on 44 – England sat 132 for three with 50 balls to go.Up stepped Alex Hales, batting lower than opener for the first time in his 53 internationals, striking five fours – either deftly guided, slashed or swept – and two sixes, over long-on, in a 24-ball 49 that was ended in the 19th over when slapping a slower ball bouncer straight back to Marcus Stoinis tennis-style. He and Joe Root, 35 from 24, had kept up the momentum with a fourth-wicket stand of 72 from 39 balls but though the England Test captain himself struck 35 in 24, Jonny Bairstow clubbing two sixes – one first ball and another to end the innings – in his quickfire 14, he probably should have been the man for No 5 on this surface.Australia actually clawed things back a touch in the final three overs. Andrew Tye showed his class in the last, with just two runs leaked and Root run out before Bairstow propelled him over long-on. But with such a total on the board, their reply was always going to need a greater mastery of England’s spinners than witnessed in the one-day series.Finch did have some joy but was shorn of the strike first up, looking on as D’Arcy Short chipped Liam Plunkett to short fine-leg, and Glenn Maxwell was bowled by a fine slower-ball cutter from Chris Jordan, to sit 59 for two at the end of the powerplay.From there Morgan turned to his spin twins, with Moeen removing Head, caught on the boundary, and Rashid picking up Alex Carey and Stoinis – the former playing around a leg-break – to sit 72 for five in the ninth.And though Finch took to Moeen thereafter amid a blistering assault, Rashid’s return in the 16th over saw him caught on the rope attempting a seventh six and the game was up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c2b005965a7e34f383f3f4b856445ace947cfd/372_235_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ea96661f500c8847f777d98f92849ea","title":"england v australia t20 live","story":"Australia suffered six defeats from six after a one-off Twenty20 in which England reproduced the dominance of the whitewashed one-day seriesEasy in the end. But for a brief moment, Aaron Finch did make it interesting. The captain was starved of strike in the first nine overs, but then, with Australia five down after the spin-twins of Moeen and Rashid ripped out the top and middle order, he got really busy. The opener smashed 84 in 41 balls, six times clearing the rope, ably supported by Agar (29) to get the visitors well within striking distance. But when Rashid came back into the attack and won his wicket in the 16th over the result was inevitable. So that’s a clean sweep on the tour, the hosts winning all six fixtures as Australia pack their bags for Zimbabwe for a T20 tri-series. It’ll be a toss of the coin for man of the match between Buttler for his rapid 61 and Rashid for his clutch 327 in defence of 221. I’d go with the leggie. Keen an eye on the website for the match report, which I’m sure will be up soon. We’ll be back with the OBO tomorrow afternoon from Bristol when England’s women host New Zealand in the T20 triseries. Until then, bye for now! Billy Stanlake plonks Plunkett over midwicket for six but tries it again and doesn’t get much on it at all, the sklipper Morgan running around from cover to take the catch and complete the match! England comfortable victors by 28 runs. “It’s plain to me that there is an escalation in weird places to email or tweet to you from,” writes Scott Probst to conclude the emails for the night. “Now an ambulance. What has the British health system come to?” It has been good fun chatting tonight. Thanks for your emails. Tye tries to plonk back to back straight sixes off Willey but just fails to get over the head of Plunkett on the long-on boundary. To be fair to the West Australian, he has certainly enhanced his reputation as a hitter on this tour, which won’t be for nothing when they are thinking about the ODI World Cup squad in about nine months from now.19th over: Australia 186-9 (Swepson 3, Stanlake 1) Target 222 Singles exchanged through the off side to conclude Willey’s night, 131 with eight dot balls. He did good. 18th over: Australia 177-8 (Tye 14, Swepson 1) Target 222 Swepson has spent countless hours in the nets on the Test tours he has been on but I strongly doubt that will give him the superhuman powers he requires to pull of a miracle from here. A nice drive to extra cover, mind, before Tye strikes hard down the ground for two more to finish. 45 from 12 needed. (Yeah, I know). Kane Richardson’s nightmare of an evening ends with a first ball blob. Jordan is on a hat-trick with the South Australian gifting a catch to mid-off with Hales taking it easily.The resistance should be broken now! Agar bowled behind his legs from an 88mph rocket. That’s why Jordan is in this team: he’s fast and accurate. 17th over: Australia 173-6 (Agar 29, Tye 11) Target 222 Willey does a fine job here, conceding only singles. There is a wide in there too but the accuracy there with his yorkers wide of the crease was outstanding. 49 needed from 18 balls.“And I thought T20 was silly but it’s tingling,” writes Jeremy Bunting. “I’m reading this in the back of an ambulance, all wired up with ECG etc. Fortunately the paramedic is enjoying this too. We’re just trying to keep my pulse rate down.” A common affliction. For so many years I tried to ignore T20. Now, I can’t get enough of it. 16th over: Australia 167-6 (Agar 27, Tye 8) Target 222 Well, maybe it should be finished but nobody tell Andrew Tye who has smacked Adil Rashid into the crowd at midwicket to finish his spell! Have that! Keeps the strike with a drive down the ground that he has absoltely flogged. Interesting. Rashid took 327 from his four. Bowled.“Re: Scott of Iceland fame (Over 5),” replies Guy Hornsby. “For clarity, I was referring to the mighty cricket, of course. Let’s not go down some sort of Fred WestTrueman rabbit hole shall we? Anyway, what was that about being a bit short at 220?” Scott, over to youYou cannot fault Aaron Finch but he’s gone! He took on Rashid down the ground but miscued a delivery that had a bit of air. Jordan raced around from long on to complete the catch in the deep. The captain is gone for 84 from 41 balls. That should be it. 15th over: Australia 154-5 (Finch 80, Agar 26) Target 222 Back to seam with Chris Jordan, who went around a bit earlier. Good start with a couple of well-landed slower balls but Agar is up to the task, timing spectacularly through cover out of the block hole for his fourth boundary. The West Australian is well and truly doing his bit here. Two more yorkers to finish for Jordan, both Australians taking singles down the ground in response. Finch to take strike next over with Rashid back on. Good cricket. 82 from 38 needed.14th over: Australia 144-5 (Finch 76, Agar 20) Moeen to bowl out his fourth over here. Agar is down with that, crossbatting him over his head for four! Finch gets his chance for the second half of the set and goes big over midwicket for another six. You can’t bowl full tosses at Aaron Finch. Two balls to go, he’s straight over his head in almost identical fashion to Agar earlier in the over - four more! AND AGAIN! SIX OVER MIDWICKET! THE BIGGEST OF THE LOT! 22 from the over and suddenly it is game on! There, I’ve said it! These two have put on 72 in 32 balls. They need 13 an over from here. Moeen finishes with with 158 (!) from his four after two punishing overs. 13th over: Australia 122-5 (Finch 59, Agar 15) Another six to Finch to start this Plunkett over! Over long-off, not the sweetest shot he has hit tonight but just does enough to for him to go journey for the fourth time in the last couple of overs. Agar’s turn now, playing an outstanding square drive for four more! Singles from each of them to conclude the set, Finch keeping the strike as the 50-run stand is reached in just 26 balls. Another two of those and they win. Simple game, right?12th over: Australia 109-5 (Finch 51, Agar 10) Finch frees the arms, picks his spot and lands a big blow: his second dig into the midwicket crowd to begin the new Moeen Ali over. Agar’s turn and the bat comes out of his hand when swinging! Not ideal. Finch does keep the willow in his, making solid contact again at Moeen, this time down the ground. Now big again! Twice in the over Finch gets it over the ropes at midwicket. That’s huge and Finch moves to 50 with the blow 27 balls for him to get there with five fours and three sixes. The ball has been damaged in its journey so they need to grab a new ball with one delivery to come. Will Finch let the good times roll and swing again? Nup, he takes the single on offer at deep point to keep the strike. Spot on. So then, 19 taken from the over to keep the Australians in touch. 11th over: Australia 90-5 (Finch 33, Agar 9) Agar can’t Radhid him off the square early in the over. Oh right, now I’ve said that he’s smashed him over midwicket for six! Stand and deliver stuff from Ashton. Nice. But two more dots to finish the over making just seven from it with two balls scored off. Immaculate white-ball bowling from the leggie. 10th over: Australia 83-5 (Finch 32, Agar 3) When Finch does get his chance, he steps down at Moeen and slogs it across the ropes at midwicket for six! The first of the Australian innings. By contrast, England smacked ten of them. Quick single to short third man to finish, again from Finch, Agar is just safe from the direct hit. Ten from it but at the halfway mark the required rate for Australia is now 14.3 an over. Finch would need to get 100 of them. Stoinis second ball gives some catching practice to long-off, Roy making no mistake. The second time in a row that Marcus Stoinis has fallen for a duck. Three wickets in nine balls from the spinners. “This is quite brilliant from England,” says Nasser Hussain again. “He’s a much, much improved cricketer. He has a lot of control.” 9th over: Australia 73-5 (Finch 24, Agar 1) Again off the mark down the ground to keep the strike. Finch can’t get a hit. He’s faced just 19 balls in nine overs. What doing?Bowled him! With no footwork to speak of, Carey tried to punch Rashid through the legside but he only got enough wood on it to end up back on his stumps. “If Moeen Ali doesn’t get you, Alid Rashid must!” roars Nasser Hussain on the telly. He’s not wrong. 8th over: Australia 70-3 (Finch 24, Carey 1) Moeen turns the screws, racing through the remainder of his over in about 45 seconds. Finch, with the pressure piling up, deflects precisely to the third man rope to give the visitors some brief respite. What a summer for the England spinners! For the umpteenth time, Moeen Ali gets in the book as soon as he comes into the attack with Head popping a catch straight down the throat of Hales at long-on. 7th over: Australia 63-2 (Finch 18, Head 15) Finch tries to give himself room to Adil Rashid’s first over, showing his stumps, but he keeps picking out the fielders in the ring on the off-side. Both players take singles down the ground to finish but just four from the over. Tough going for the visitors from here. One of these two need to explode. 6th over: Australia 59-2 (Finch 16, Head 13) Target 222 Australia’s 50 up with an elevated cross-bat whack over mid-off from Finch. The skipper has only faced eight balls in six overs - not ideal for a bloke who can make it count more than most with the field in. Anyway, it’s Willey again with an excellent bumper that Finch can’t get away. The Victorian finishes the over nicely with a well-timed clip into the gap for four behind square. That’s the power play done. At the same time, England were 70-0.5th over: Australia 47-2 (Finch 7, Head 11) Target 222 Nice timing on the Trav Head clip to begin, winning him four. Plunkett mixes up his pace and lengths for the rest of the set, preventing a second boundary from being taken - all inside edges and miscued pulls. One more power play over left. Hi Ho Silver Lining gets a run at the end of the over, which could be the Cricket Ground DJ trolling Finch? Hard to tell.“England don’t do cold blooded killers?” probes Scott in Iceland at Guy Hornsby’s earlier note. “You wot? Crippen. The Yorkshire Ripper. Jack the Ripper. Maggie Thatcher.” A point that speaks for itself. 4th over: Australia 39-2 (Finch 6, Head 5) Target 222 The out chance was on so Willey took a ping at the non-strikers’ stumps from cover but instead, it is five added to the Australian total with four overthrows. Head, with that, off the mark. Finch keeps the strike with a tuck around the corner. Wickets in consecutive overs setting England up perfectly to suck the life out of this as a genuine contest if they can get one more before the spin twins come on.So much for that. The delivery after Maxwell slaps a free hit down to long-on and Jordan has taken his off-stump out of the ground with a slower ball. He was shuffling in the crease to try and make a good over a very good one but when the ball belatedly arrived it was a big swing and an costly miss. Australia already in strife.3rd over: Australia 24-1 (Finch 5, Maxwell 2) Target 222 In comes Glenn Maxwell. He was the MC at Aaron Finch’s wedding in April, which meant both men missed the first game of the IPL. What I’m trying to say is that these two are good mates who know how to bat together. The successful over ends with a Finch boundary, slashed over third man. The Edgbaston punters singing Three Lions again, and in turn, so am I. Simply helped around the corner to Moeen, cruising the circle on the 45. Maybe a bit of pace off the ball to prompt the error but it is a soft dismissal no matter how it is cut. Plunkett can’t be kept quiet, into the book from his second delivery of the night.2nd over: Australia 17-0 (Short 16, Finch 0) Chris Jordan gets the new ball and beats Short with a wide yorker to begin nothing wrong with that. “The batsman wouldn’t expect that” notes Kumar Sangakkara on the telly. Next up though, he’s on the hip and Short does reach the rope for the first time in this daunting chase. Then he goes again, this time to fine leg for four more. That’ll help his confidence. The opener then slaps a lovely, lovely drive through cover. Three on the bounce! It prompts the Cricket Ground DJ (DREAM JOB) to blast Guru Josh, which never fails to bring me up at a game of cricket. Accurate bumper to finish from the Sussex quick.“Evening Adam.” G’day Guy Hornsby. “I know there’s this other tournament on apparently, but I’ll take this lot over Brazil any day. I know it’s far too far out from the Big Cup yet, but the ruthlessness and unrelenting throat-treading force of this England team is chilling, even to us Poms. We just don’t really do cold-blooded killers, so the depth of clean strikers and canny, ice-cool bowlers in this squad feels totally alien, but exhilarating all the same. Like a vodka shot on the commute to work. 220 almost seems a bit short, given where we were, which is really terrifying.” Probably threw away 250. How’s that for mental? 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Short 3, Finch 0) Not the sort of start that Australia needed from their explosive left-hander, D’Arcy Short beaten twice to begin. He gets a couple later in the over and is unlucky not to record a boundary when driving straight - the stumps getting in the way. A wide in there too makes four from the Willey set. “Yes Adam,” replies Scott. “I was in a packed pub (the Bastard Brew) in Reykjavik for the event. Followed in quick succession by a number of other pubs. Suffice to say an epic night followed. I’m not sure why I bothered to pay for that bed at the guesthouse, it didn’t see much use.” I went to Homecoming Dance (in the USA) with an Inga from Iceland. That’s all I’ve got.“Hey Adam.” Scott, welcome to my inbox. “I’m following the commentary on the bus to Akureyri on Northern Iceland. Currently south of Borganes. I’m looking forward to reading about Maxi’s heroics (which for some reason my phone wanted to correct to herpes). Keep up the good work!”I know all about that auto-correct! Did you watch the football with the locals yesterday? I was very (very) lucky to be on the radio commentary when Maxwell hit 145 in 65 balls at Kandy a couple of years ago in a T20I. Go that again, Big Show. I dare ya. Clinical from England. The base was laid with 70 in the power play through Roy (44) and Buttler (61). The latter was outstanding again, tallying his half-century in 22 balls - a new England record. Hales (49) finished off the job with Root (35) doing his job as well. For Australia, Swepson on debut was the best of the bowlers earning 237. Two of Tye’s overs were off the very top shelf but his 037 won’t show that. They chased 250-odd at Auckland in February so they will back themselves - this is T20, afterall. But the hosts won’t need to do much to shut the game down if they can get power play wickets. Grab a drink and a bite to eat, I’ll catch you in about ten minutes for the chase. 20th over: England 213-4 (Bairstow 14, Moeen Ali 0) Last delivery of the innings. Bairstow picks the knuckle-ball yorker and plonks it over the wide long-on rope into the crowd, who have had a great old time watching this. Only eight from the final over but England have finished with plenty.  What a final over this is! Four dots and a leg-bye from Tye so far, Root unable to get his yorkers away. When Bairstow played and missed the penultimate delivery, they ran anyway and Root was run out. Can the West Australian the landing? 19th over: England 213-4 (Root 34, Bairstow 8) The Hollies Stand are singing Three Lions and the entire ground join in. The new man Bairstow is here now and first ball has the space to slap over long-off for six! Just get your eye in then, Jonny. To be fair to Stoinis, he gets through the last four balls giving away three singles. That’s a win to the visitors. What a catch! Stoinis, on for his first twist, bowled an off-cutter bouncer at Hales first up, so high he tried to tennis-serve it down the ground. But the big all-rounder, in his follow-through, has stuck out his right hand and taken a beauty. Reflexes at their best. 18th over: England 204-3 (Hales 49, Root 33) Richardson is going to bowl his final over and I feel like he is some chance to break the all-time record for most runs conceded in a T20, which I reckon is 70. Hales helps, bringing up the England 200 with an elegant sweep from a yorker after dancing across his stumps. This is the modern age! A thick edge sails to third man next ball but Richardson will be relieved a fielder is there to cut it off. He’s back down the ground again for a couple before playing and missing at the final delivery. Nine off it to save Richardson’s blushes somewhat 059 from his four.17th over: England 195-3 (Hales 43, Root 30) Tye again so Hales plays one of the shots of the night, clearing his front leg to time a full ball down to long-on for four. Less nuance involved later in the over, picking up a ball in the slot and depositing it into the crowd at long-on for six! That’s his second big one, moving into the 40s. Back to fun and games to finish for Root, flicking a reverse scoop through the vacant cordon for four more! Sure, why not? That makes 17 from the over. England on track for 220-odd.

But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Were her fears justified?I think the first time I became concerned about my trip to Haiti was on the connecting flight from Miami. A woman on the plane, who I assume had spotted I was an outsider, asked me why I was going there. I have learned not to say that I’m doing a TV show, because that immediately leads to more questions than you get at immigration control, so I told her it was for a holiday. At that point, she became extremely animated, asking me if I knew how dangerous it was.I was with one of the producers of my new show, in which I go on holiday to places I wouldn’t usually visit. Just as we were beginning to feel genuine concern for our own wellbeing, the woman asked where we were staying and, on hearing the answer, looked horrified. She told us not to leave the hotel grounds after dark. I didn’t know what I was more frightened of: Haiti or this woman.Such a conversation cannot help but put you on edge. The sights of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, do little to dull that. As we drove from the airport to the hotel, which was definitely in a dangerous area, we were confronted with a combination of poverty, overcrowding and the aftermath of an earthquake that could have taken place months ago rather than years. What added to all of this was the enormous collection of voodoo statues (or Vodou, as it’s spelled in Haiti) that adorned the hotel gardens. I have to be honest: while it is nice to see cultural adornments, the combination of jet lag, scary woman on plane and arresting city visuals meant that I found the voodoo imagery particularly freaky. This is, of course, all down to cultural ignorance on my part. But it was still freaky. I would have killed to see a gnome.I was still frazzled when I went to bed that night. My room was a little walk away from the main hotel building and, as I was walking over to it, a dog came running out of the bushes and starting barking at me. I immediately turned around and headed back to the hotel. I say headed, but I obviously sprinted. I then turned back and the dog was gone. I waited a few minutes and went back out, whereupon I was once again chased by the bush dog. I repeated this process five times, as if I thought the dog might only have five chases in him. I then spent some time sitting in the lobby of the hotel, thinking about just sleeping there and wondering if dogs can actually live in bushes. All of this was strongly contributing to the opinion I was forming that Haiti was very much not for me. After about half an hour of this misery, I decided to give it one last try. I don’t know whether the dog had fallen asleep, or if it had seen me crying in the lobby, but I made it to my room. Which had loads more voodoo stuff in it. I was keen to explore voodoo while I was there, as I was pretty sure that relying on what I’d seen in Live and Let Die and various horror films had probably skewed my view. I asked if I could be cured of my anxiety, whereupon I was sent to pick up some items from a voodoo market. I was required to purchase a series of items that I would give to the voodoo priest in order to complete the ceremony. The list was baffling. I had to buy deodorants and colognes, which essentially meant that any airport duty free is a great voodoo stop-off. In addition to this I was required to buy powders with names like “leave me alone powder” and “go over there powder”. I seem like I’m being cynical, and I am, but mainly because I was being shown around by a man called Reggie whose stall, by coincidence, stocked all of the items I required.It’s difficult visiting somewhere like Haiti and – in particular – Port-au-Prince. The fact is that it is not particularly pleasant to spend time there. We were taken to Cité Soleil, the most poverty-stricken area of the capital. It had all the textbook items you would look for in a poverty safari: children wearing nothing, awful sanitation and rickety accommodation. Cité Soleil has the added factor of absolutely no police, which means that gun crime is rife and kidnappings happen. I wasn’t particularly keen on going, but not just for the obvious reasons. I wasn’t sure I wanted to wander round peering at these people, stroking my chin and talking about what a shame it all was. In fact, the only reason we went was because I was told it was safe and one of the locals was keen to show us around and prove its reputation wasn’t warranted. Its reputation is fully warranted. Yvon, our guide, told us that everyone there would know I was with him and there would be no issues. What in fact happened was that men with guns would see us walk by, shout something at Yvon, who would cower and say something timid back, then try to convince me they were talking about the weather. It was in Cité Soleil that I discovered a bizarre Haitian tradition to do with dominoes. Every time you lose a game you have to attach a clothes peg to your body. The initial peg doesn’t hurt so much, but if you rack up a few losses the cumulative pain of loads of clothes pegs is apparently horrific. Plus you then have no way of drying your clothes. I imagine if you haven’t a lot of money, pegs are a way of keeping a gambling element involved in difficult circumstances. That type of chin-strokey sentence is exactly why I didn’t want to visit Cité Soleil. I heard a lot of raboday during my time in Haiti. This is a relatively new form of music, which probably sounds closest to reggaeton. If you don’t know what that is, I guess raboday’s closest British equivalent would be grime. If you don’t know what that is, then read another article, grandad. The biggest star of raboday is a guy called Marinad 007, whose song Madan Papa was playing everywhere. I was reliably informed that it is about sugar daddies. I say reliably informed, because we were lucky enough to meet Marinad and he displayed the classic rapper traits of being hugely eloquent in his songs and borderline mute in conversation. While my time in Port-au-Prince was challenging, it would be remiss not to mention how beautiful other parts of the country are. I spent some time in Jacmel on the southern coast, with its beautiful beaches and touristy hotels. It’s probably the first time I remembered that we were next door to the Dominican Republic, where everybody goes on holiday. I was making a TV show, however, so I was not allowed to spend time on the beach. I was taken to Bassin Bleu, a series of three freshwater pools you can swim in and jump into from cliffs. I was presented with two jumps and was told that I would be attempting the higher of the two. The director said it was totally up to me whether I jumped or not, but that they didn’t have an ending for the Bassin Bleu bit of the show if I didn’t. What I was not told was that, once you climb up, it is probably just as dangerous to climb back down as to jump. I will leave you to watch the show to see what happened. (I jumped and survived. You don’t have to watch.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13d2d779d4803c6b8c14a8148f4d284a7ffe97d/192_77_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc45facd859dc47b9a8111c56b0171dd","title":"stath lets flats review finding the funny in generation rents plight","story":"Well he – Stath – tries to, anyway. Tries to let flats. The trouble is, he’s not very good at it. Sharp-suited but dim-witted, incompetent and inappropriate. In short: a bit of a dick. “Oh blimey, there’s a man in the bath, I can see his willy,” he says to a couple he’s showing around a property, quickly closing the bathroom door. “Hahaha, just joking, it’s a lovely flat, there’s no willies,” he says, opening the door again.We are introduced to Stath (played by the show’s creator, Jamie Demetriou) in a montage of showings. He arrives late in the company car, which he parks badly outside some disgusting, pokey, damp, dark, basement that is on for about double a nurse’s monthly pay (this is London). “I’m Stath,” he says, offering an awkward hand to potential tenants – awkward because the upper part of the arm is also being used to hold the property details against Stath’s side, he’s got his phone in the other hand.“I’m Stath,” he says. Sometimes it’s “many happy returns”, not because it’s their birthday, just for a little joke, you know, to break the ice. Always “I’m an idiot”, although he says this without actually saying it, just through everything he does. And perhaps also “I’m a sitcom trope”. The loud, UPPER-CASE IMBECILE, lacking in self-awareness, although not entirely unlovable ... What is that cool wind sending a shiver through you suddenly? Is it the “airiness” (Storm Hector, practically) coming under the badly fitted door of the flat Stath is showing you around and wants £1,750 pcm for? Or is it the ghost of David Brent passing, 17 years on?The situation is fresh, at least – not so much the estate agent part of it, and the tosser-typers therein, but north London’s Greek-Cypriot community. In the office of Michael \u0026amp Eagle, which may not be a million miles from Haringay thoroughfare Green Lanes, dad Vasos is getting on a bit, wanting to retire to spend more time on the iPad, and needs to pass on the empire. It’s King Lear, north-London-style, but with gags.Trouble is, the choice of heirs is Stath, or his sister Sophie (played by his real-life sister, Natasia Demetriou) who is no less of an idiot. A different kind of idiot, though: quieter, less annoying, just a bit dumb – she’s lost when at the bus stop on the other side of the road from the office. It is a lovely performance. Lovely performances and character creation from both of them, and there is – unsurprisingly – a genuine relationship between them. (At this point Stath would probably say something inappropriate.) What must it have been like in the Demetriou household, with two wannabe standupcomic actors? Wannabe and gonnabe. Amusing and entertaining, I imagine.Sophie is less interested in managing the business, more interested – weirdly – in Al (Alastair Roberts) in the office. But then Al is whacked in the face by a spinning flipchart, spun by Stath, of course, and Sophie tries to take him to the hospital, although what she thought was a hospital (because it was a big building) turns out to be just that, a big building, an office.Slapstick plays a big part in SLF. There’s also a pigeon on the loose in the loft of one Michael \u0026amp Eagle property, which ends up, inevitably, with pigeon v Stath and three smashed tellies. Nice performance from the pigeon, too.Meanwhile, next door is a posher, more English estate agent. It could be Foxtons, but it’s actually called Smethwicks, with whom Vasos has an ongoing wheelie-bin feud. The tall, blond, arrogant Smethwicks agent, looks down disdainfully on his neighbours. Is his smile sneerier still since 23 June 2016, I wonder?Brexit and Windrush, too, perhaps, add a little piquancy to Stath Lets Flats, the well-established immigrant community feeling a little less secure. And it’s an honest, fond, insider’s look at that community. Plus, it’s a pretty accurate portrait of the capital’s ongoing housing crisis, where no amount of agent bullshit can hide the fact that a horrid hole costs stupid money.Those – along with the characters and performances – are the ticks, the “it’s not too far to the tube”, and “it has a nice feel to it”. Nice observations in the writing, too, especially some of the less obvious ones, such as Al saying “Fine thanks, yep, how you doing?” to Sophie, even though she didn’t ask him how he was and had just said “Hiya”.But then there’s the damp – the fact it only goes somewhere new geographically, rather comedically. And the pokiness – the heavy reliance on physical comedy.“Do you want to take it?” asks Stath, and then again, a bit more agressively. Er … no, I need another viewing, next week, before signing anything, OK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db7eec180e23ee87d4065da29990a7d09f4406d/0_118_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5c8aaf3a42cac067836532dac456a8","title":"john bolton vladimir putin moscow visit us russia","story":"Russian presidential aide says location of meeting will not be in the US or Russia, after meeting between Putin and John BoltonDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin have agreed a time and place to hold their first official summit, a senior Russian official announced on Wednesday.The Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told journalists that the summit will be held in a country other than Russia or the United States. The date and location of the meeting will be announced on Thursday, Ushakov said.The announcement followed a one-on-one meeting between the US national security adviser, John Bolton, and Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, where the two sides discussed the summit, nuclear arms control and other bilateral issues, according to the Russian side.Bolton confirmed that the meeting would take place and said Moscow and Washington would announce the details “simultaneously”. The summit will be the two leaders’ first encounter since they met at the G20 summit in July 2017.In Washington, Trump suggested Vienna or Helsinki as possible venues. He told reporters that he had watched the Bolton-Putin interview on television but had yet to receive a “full report”.“It would look like we will probably be meeting in the not too distant future and I’ve said it from day one getting along with Russia and China and with everybody is a very good thing,” the president said in the Oval Office.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, Bolton defended the meeting, saying: “I don’t think it’s unusual for the leaders of Russia and the US to meet,” he said.Trump and Putin “think now is the time for them to get together”, Bolton said. “Direct communications between Trump and Putin is in the best interests of the United States.”Asked about what the summit could achieve he said he was not sure anything concrete would follow. The “fact of the summit is a deliverable”, he said.Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, did not veer widely from stated US policy. He said US policy had not changed on sanctions imposed after Russia seized Crimea, and, asked about Moscow’s interference in US elections, said: “I think Trump is going to raise the full range of issues between Russia and the United States, absolutely.”Asked whether the US would recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said: “That is not the position of the United States.”Bolton, accompanied by the US ambassador to Moscow, Jon Huntsman, also met the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and an adviser, Yuri Ushakov, whose portfolio includes US policy.“I have to say with regret that Russian-American relations are not in the best shape,” Putin told Bolton, “and I’ve already said this repeatedly in public and am saying this to you now: I think that this is largely a result of the acute internal political struggle within the US itself.”He added: “Your arrival in Moscow has given us hope that we can make the first steps to reviving full relations between our governments.”Russia has said it is open to a summit between Putin and Trump, and it has been reported that White House and Kremlin officials have met in recent months to make preparations. Vienna and Helsinki have been suggested as potential venues for the meeting.The two sides have been at odds over issues including Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 US election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, cybersecurity, Nato policy and nuclear weapons. Relations between the two countries are widely seen as being at their worst since the cold war.Bolton has previously called for a tougher US stance against Iran, North Korea and Russia. But Trump has charted a course more favourable to Putin, defying a US foreign policy establishment that has widely condemned Russia for allegedly hacking US political parties and spreading disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign.Russia and the US have closed consulates and expelled hundreds of diplomats in tit-for-tat actions during the diplomatic fallout.Trump and Putin met twice at a G20 meeting Hamburg last year, and had a discussion over dinner with only a Russian translator also present. Trump said the leaders discussed adoption policy.Expectations for any summit between Putin and Trump are modest, especially as meaningful sanctions relief for Russia would require the consent of the US Congress.Speaking to a Senate committee on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said: “The president is looking forward to an opportunity to find those handful of places where we can have productive conversations that lead to improvements for each of our two countries.“I think we have our eyes wide open that that space is pretty small,” Pompeo added. “They don’t share our values in the same way the European countries do. But I think the president is hopeful we can reduce the temperature and reduce the risk for America.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab0161c42e7340c7e7a738548deda0e8b45fb75/0_270_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee088ea01eef6eff1c5cff14b610572","title":"yangtze at 100km intervals a photo essay","story":"Mother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraMother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraThe Yangtze river is usually celebrated by idealistic images of iconic places. But with Mother River, Yan Wang Preston wanted to undermine the deep-seated preference towards certain river places and their landscape representations. By selecting photographic sites at equally spaced locations, she did not necessarily produce a picturesque view. Instead, the project is filled with random landscapes that have rarely been photographed before. The project aims to tell a story of the entire width of China from its western highland to its eastern coast and demonstrates that in an era of abundant satellite mapping and saturated imagery, fresh views can still be created by a simple mapping exercise.“In modern China though, it is the Yangtze that has been promoted by the central government as the main national icon. This is to do with the Yangtze’s importance for China’s development. It provides the most important trade route into the wealthiest area of China. It is the physical and metaphorical frontline of China’s modernisation, with over 30 hydroelectric dams planned or constructed on it. It provides an analogy for China’s political unification as it is the longest river in China which ‘connects’ all the regions from Tibet to Shanghai. For all these reasons the Yangtze is in focus, and that’s why I wanted to work on it.”“My journey began at 5,400m above sea level in the uninhabited zone known as the Tibetan Plateau. From here, the Yangtze river flows through majestic mountains with almost no access at all, before hitting the industrial lowland near Shanghai.”“Inhospitable terrain and huge distances made this project a modern-day adventure, with many potential hazards including high-altitude sickness, off-road driving, floods, sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides and mudslides.”“Not surprisingly, the process of realising the Mother River project wasn’t without incident. Two locations (Y15 \u0026amp Y16) remain unreached to this day, while 24 locations (Y39 - Y62) were originally depicted in poorly exposed images, because I loaded the films back-to-front by mistake. (I decided to re-shoot afterwards). It is precisely these imperfections that testify to the physicality of this highly conceptual project, and which also give it a particularly ‘human’ touch.”Yan Wang Preston is an award-winning British-Chinese artist. Mother River has won the Shiseido photography prize (Beijing, 2016) and Reviewers’ Choice Award at FORMAT (Derby, 2014). It was nominated for both the Prix Pictet award and The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c152986fd5f30c91652d010c560c260819bc5b8/470_72_3455_2073/master/3455.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355623511c36be935d6918a2f9f8bccf","title":"make america talk again how to bridge the partisan divide","story":"Could the secret to healing a riven politics lie in a Difficult Conversations Laboratory?This is an edited version of a longer piece that you can find hereIn a hard-to-find windowless room deep inside a New York university, some difficult conversations are taking place. But this is not unusual, because this is a Difficult Conversations Laboratory.Though it does not physically resemble a dungeon, it probably should. Researchers conducting experiments here routinely generate the kind of excruciating discomfort that most of us spend every family gathering trying to avoid.Participants sign a waiver warning them that the experiments could cause stress or unpleasant feelings, before they are surveyed on a range of fraught topics, from abortion to the Israel-Palestine conflict. They are paired with someone who utterly disagrees with them and asked to talk things through around a small conference table. All while being recorded.It does not always go well – but that’s the point.“It is hard to study real-life, intractable conflict as it happens,” says the social psychologist Peter T Coleman, who started the lab over a decade ago with a group of colleagues. “This is an attempt to get as close as we can.” So far, the lab and several satellites worldwide have hosted and analysed nearly 500 contentious encounters.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSo, as part of a longer piece of work on conflict, I visited Columbia University earlier this year to learn how its findings could be applied to the hyper-partisanship that has gripped the US. When asked in experiments to distribute hypothetical scholarships or cash awards, Americans are now more likely to discriminate based on political affiliation than on race. Manipulated by politicians, pundits and special interests, too many people have collapsed into lazy prejudice.So I sought out people who know conflict intimately and have developed creative ways of navigating it: mediators and other people who work with livid spouses, feuding business partners, and spiteful neighbours. They understand how humans behave when they feel threatened and angry – and how to break through to something more interesting.In the lab, after each conversation ends, the participants listen back to the recording and report their emotions at each point. When that data was fed into a graphic display, the researchers noticed something interesting. The better-quality conversations looked different: the patterns resembled a constellation of feelings, like data points spread across the galaxy of emotions, rather than a simple back-and-forth tug of war.In these conversations, people still experienced negative emotions, but not consistently. They cycled through frustration and discomfort, but also demonstrated a flexibility absent from the conversations that got “stuck”.“It’s not like they give up and say ‘oh, you’re right’. Nobody does that,” Coleman says. “But there’s more balance – of having your position and also being willing to ask questions.” The contrast with the other conversations was clear. “People who get stuck, they collapse into negativity. Everything the other person says is wrong and stupid. It’s an emotional collapse and a cognitive collapse – because they stop being able to process anything that the other person is saying.”Is this determined by the temperament of the people involved? Or is something else at work, something that could be induced in stressed out Americans?One condition that matters is subtle but logical: It turns out that when people build up even a small buffer of goodwill, their conversations go much better. Specifically, people need to have about three moments of positive feelings for every one moment of negativity. (The marriage expert John Gottman has found that married couples need a slightly higher ratio of about five good moments for every bad one – more evidence that marriage is harder than politics.)So complexity can be cultivated. But how do you generate goodwill in a debate about abortion with a stranger who vehemently disagrees with you?Gary Friedman has mediated more than 2,000 conflicts in his career. To create goodwill, Friedman practices a strategy called “looping for understanding”. You distill the essence of what the other person is saying, and then play it back to them. There’s no need to agree with the person – or even to pretend to like them. “The point is not to convince, nor to contradict, nor to take exception to, nor explain away,” as Friedman writes in Challenging Conflict, which he co-authored. “The point is to understand.” We are wrong more often than we think. To understand what someone really means requires a lot of double-checking. It seems obvious, a bit contrived, but it works like magic. Training with Friedman and a dozen other mediators earlier this year, I practiced looping and being looped, over and over again. I was humbled by how often I thought I’d understood the person, but had missed some important nuance.Later, as an experiment, I tried looping my 11-year-old son when he complained about having to go to bed. “You’re really frustrated that you can’t stay up later,” I told him. He went to bed. Using techniques like looping to build goodwill is helpful and important in our own conversations, but it can’t compete with the impact of cable news and talk radio. Is there a way to induce complexity at scale, regardless of how much goodwill we each can generate?Back at the Difficult Conversations Lab, researchers tried another experiment. Before participants met, they were given one of two versions of an article to read about a controversial issue such as immigration. One version laid out both sides of the issue, for and against immigration. The other contained the same information, but included more complexity, offering a spectrum of opinions. It read less like a traditional news story and more like an anthropologist’s field notes.Psychologists call this process “priming” – preparing participants to think in certain ways. The idea here was to prime one set of participants for complexity. And it worked. Again and again, people who read the more complicated article went on to have richer conversations. They asked more questions, proposed higher quality ideas and left the lab more satisfied with their conversations. “They don’t solve the debate,” Coleman says, “but they do have a more nuanced understanding and more willingness to continue the conversation.” Complexity is contagious.The lesson for journalists like me was clear: embrace complexity. Highlight nuance, contradiction and ambiguity wherever you can find it. For one thing, complexity leads to a fuller, more accurate version of reality. It also increases the odds that new information will be taken seriously. But journalists almost always do the opposite. Reporters cut the quotes that don’t fit the narrative, or our editor cuts them for us. We look for coherence, which is tidy and natural. But in a time of high conflict, coherence is bad journalism, bordering on malpractice. Tidy narratives gently warp reality until one side looks good and the other looks evil. Then our audiences soothe themselves with the knowledge that all Republicans are racist rednecks – or all Democrats are precious snowflakes who hate America.In reality, racist beliefs cross party boundaries. One in four supporters of Hillary Clinton in 2016 believed black people were lazier than white people. That doesn’t mean racism didn’t influence the election, only that it interacted with other forces, in many ways, in all kinds of people. In other words: it’s complicated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3545457.1530126839!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures set to reach record levels as almost 31 degrees recorded","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman carries an inflatable shark on the promenade of Salthill beach onTuesday. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne ReutersTemperatures are on track to hit record highs in the coming days with heat levels expected to reach at least 32 degrees. Temperatures soared on Wednesday afternoon, hitting 30.8 degrees by 4.30pm at Shannon Airport. These highs are expected to continue on Thursday with temperatures as high as 32 degrees in parts of the country. Meteorologist Joanna Donnelly said she expected the hot weather to peak at 32 degrees but it was possible the heat could continue to rise above that figure. The highest temperature ever recorded in Ireland was 33.3 degrees, at Kilkenny Castle, on 26th June 1887. In July 2006, the heat reached 32.3 degrees in the town of Elphin in Co Roscommon while in June 1976 it hit 31.6 degrees. During the summer of 1995, when Ireland basked in six weeks of unbroken sunshine, the peak temperature was recorded as 31.1 in Athy, Co Kildare. The high temperatures are expected to continue through the week, dropping slightly over the weekend and into next week. However, for now it looks like the sunny skies and warm weather are here to stay. “There’s no rain on the horizon,” said Ms Donnelly. “We’ve got these high, high temperatures until Friday and it’s still going to be warm through the week. There’s more uncertainty in the forecast beyond then.”Forecasters should be able to predict whether temperatures over the coming days will hit record levels by Wednesday evening, she added. Readings from Dublin at the same time were lower than most of the country, with temperatures of 24.5 degrees at Phoenix Park, and 23 degrees at Dublin Airport. The weather on Wednesday will continue the long, dry spell of sunshine seen since the weekend. Maximum afternoon temperatures will range from 26 to 30 degrees. It will be slightly cooler along coastal areas, due to onshore breezes, particularly on the east and south coasts. Temperatures in these areas will be closer to the low 20s, the national forecaster has said. Met Éireann’s national forecast for Wednesday night predicts temperatures of between 10 and 13 degrees, with fog patches across parts of the country in the very early hours of the morning. Overall temperatures for Thursday look set to be between 26 and 30 degrees. Ice cream brand HB said they expect to sell up to 2 million ice creams over the course of the week, due to the fine weather. In a statement, the firm said an estimated 11 HB brand ice creams were being bought per second, with Iceberger the most popular brand during the hot weather, followed by Brunch ice cream. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service have warned the public over the increased risk of gorse fires, due to high temperatures and dry conditions. Mark Smyth of the wildfire unit said the weather was creating a “tinderbox” for gorse fires. Many gorse fires are started intentionally, but Mr Smyth warned the public of increased risks of accidental fires. “Gorse fires can also be caused accidentally by something as simple as throwing a cigarette from a car window, leaving a glass bottle on the ground, or not extinguishing a barbecue properly,” he said. Due to the fine weather, the pollen count is likely to significantly increase, which will affect those with hay fever. The Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) issued advice for hay fever sufferers in the good weather. This included keeping windows closed when driving, to apply a small amount of Vaseline inside the nose to trap pollen, wearing wraparound sunglasses, and avoid cutting the grass or working in the garden. Water restrictions may be likely in the coming days as Irish Water are reaching “critical high” water usage in the greater Dublin area, during the heatwave. The utility have a production capacity of 610 million litres a day, on Monday 609 million litres of water was drawn down in the Dublin area.This is compared to a high point in water usage of 565 million litres a day during the summer last year. If the wider Dublin population does not take steps to conserve water and reduce usage, restrictions will be put in place, the utility has warned. In the last 24 hours water usage in the wider Dublin area dropped from 609 million litres a day to 603 million, Irish Water said on Wednesday.The dip, following calls to the public to conserve water shows “every small measure has a positive impact,” according to Kate Gannon, corporate affairs manager at Irish Water. “We have a long way to go. If the drought is prolonged, water restrictions would become unavoidable if demand does not continue to drop,” she said. “The situation remains critical and we are continuing to seek the public’s help. Every effort the public make to conserve water will help to minimise risk of supply loss to them and their community,” she said. Dublin Bus has committed to only wash their fleet of buses every three days, instead of once a day, in an effort to save water. Parts of Athlone, Kilkenny, Longford and north Dublin have experienced water restrictions and some outages, and areas in Donegal, Galway, Limerick and Mullingar are also at risk of shortages. The Irish Greyhound Board has suspended all racing trials between the hours of 10am and 7.30pm , due to the heat. A spokesman for the board said the conditions on tracks are being monitored, ahead of all race meetings. On Monday greyhound races at Longford were cancelled, but racing at Enniscorthy, Co Wexford and Youghal, Co Cork went ahead as planned, the spokesman said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Old studio at Hanover Quay will be transformed into four-storey buildingMany awaiting decisions on refugee status now entitled to apply for jobs in most sectorsInternational Network of Civil Liberties Organisations report published in GenevaBr\u0026uacute na Bhfiann offers a haven for retired personnel down on their luckP\u0026aacutedraig Sch\u0026aumller visits Cape Cod five years after being involved in collision that changed his lifeArchaeological find will add to understanding of prehistoric Ireland, says historianMinister says that Independent\u0026rsquos legislation \u0026lsquosmacks of top-down approach\u0026rsquoMedical Council received 356 complaints down from 411 in 2016Warning issued after manufacturing error may have left glass fragments in products\u0026lsquoSomething fell between the gaps\u0026rsquo says department officialPope Francis visit expected to cost \u0026lsquomore than \u0026euro10 million but less than \u0026euro20 million\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil Bill to regulate internet threatens \u0026lsquounintended consequences\u0026rsquo, TDs toldFormer Tory minister says \u0026lsquonationalist rage\u0026rsquo is getting UK in \u0026lsquoterrible mess\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoThe cheek of her,\u0026rsquo says one massgoer but others are supportive of greater equalityTDs should not to turn their offices into \u0026lsquopassport processing\u0026rsquo centres - T\u0026aacutenaisteBut new scheme excludes those who are appealing rejected asylum applicationsHeavy smoke from Glendoo Mountain blaze forces the closure of a road in the areaTicketing site says customers\u0026rsquo details may have been accessed by unknown third-partyMove will save drivers up to \u0026euro500 a year, and \u0026euro1,000 for good vehicles, Shane Ross says"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546088.1530130023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"four gold bronze age rings discovered in co donegal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe four bronze Age gold pieces – which are large enough to fit around a person’s wrist –  were found in Co Donegal. Photograph: Caroline CarrDonegal County MuseumFour solid gold rings dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age have been found in Co Donegal. The National Museum of Ireland was alerted on Wednesday that four gold objects had been discovered and appeared to date back to the Bronze Age, the period between 3200 and 600 BC. Experts from the museum travelled to the site where the artefacts were discovered and carried out an investigation of the area to try and ascertain how and when the objects had been left there. The four rings, which are large enough to fit around a person’s wrist, have been transferred to the national museum where they will be put on display once initial investigations have concluded.Maeve Sikora, the museum’s keeper of Irish antiquities, said the find had been a “chance discovery” and would play an important role in adding to the history of Bronze Age Ireland. “Every archaeological find tells you something new about a particular period. For us it’s not just about the objects but also the context – it’s the whole package.”Ms Sikora said specialists at the museum would examine the gold in order to ascertain how long the rings had been lying in the ground. Most Bronze Age objects are discovered through archaeological digs but some just show up by chance, she said. “It’s an important archaeological find and will reveal something new about the area, that period of time and will add to our understanding of prehistoric Ireland and how rich the culture was then.” Ms Sikora said the museum was unable to reveal at this time where exactly in Donegal the objects were found.Lynn Scarf, director of the museum, thanked the “finders” and the local Donegal community for their co-operation and said the museum was delighted by the find. “We would also like to acknowledge our colleagues at the Donegal County Museum for their collaboration and assistance with this discovery, and look forward to working closely with them in relation to this find over the coming months.”Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan also congratulated the people who discovered the objects and said her department was working closely with the national museum in their initial investigations. The last big Bronze Age discovery was in 2010 when a hoard of gold artefacts was recovered from a rubbish skip. The objects had previously been kept safe at a chemist’s shop in Co Roscommon after being discovered in a bog in nearby Coggalbeg in 1947 but were stolen during a robbery. Gardaí recovered the objects from the bin and they were handed over to the national museum.

The building will include a re-construction of the band’s original studio, exhibit areas and merchandising system. It will feature a cantilevered roof overlooking Grand Canal Dock. In 2002, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) bought the studio with the plan being to level it as part of the development of the dock. The band was told that their studio would be accommodated in a 32-storey development nearby, known as the U2 Tower, but the economic crash put an end to it. They bought the studio back in 2014 for a deal worth €450,000 and have now unveiled plans to develop it.

Photograph: Collins CourtsWhat a time to be alive. Leinster House was en fete. And in the mind’s eye, that steel scaffolding around the old mansion was lace bunting and the drab halls inside were festooned with Summer garlands. Because that is how people felt on Wednesday. The day after Michael Lowry’s Long Walk to Freedom.But a dark cloud hung over the Dáil. There was no sign of our hero. Each time the double doors opened, we hoped it might be him. It was not to be. Perhaps Lowry was too exhausted in the wake of his self-proclaimed “fantastic result” on Tuesday when he left court, exhilarated, as a “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three year disqualification from acting as a company director. He also exited with unanswered questions about the Finnish money at the centre of the case which didn’t make it into his books at the first attempt because it initially detoured to the Isle of Man. Curiously, this money, a cool quarter of a million pounds sterling 16 years ago - never made its presence known to the investigators in the Moriarty Tribunal, who would have been extremely interested to find out more about it. But never mind that. By not being convicted on bigger tax charges, Lowry believes he is now vindicated after “22 years of absolute turmoil”. The Long Walk to Freedom.“No one understands unless you’re in the position if you’ve been harassed, chased and hounded by various institutions of the state,” he quivered outside the court. This, in particular, must have been a reference to his leading roles in the McCracken and Moriarty Tribunals. The former concluded a supermarket tycoon paid for a lavish extension to his house and the latter issued a damning verdict on then government minister Lowry’s “insidious and pervasive influence” on the decision to award Ireland’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone. But now this “fantastic result” is there to clear the air, the words of the judge wafting away all the bad stuff with his declaration that the Tipperary TD was a “conscientious tax payer” who previously “put his hand in his pocket” to settle a €1.4 million tax bill dating back to 1997.Sure you have to be delighted for Lowry. It was just unfortunate the main man wasn’t there to accept the plaudits from his peers. Some of us had been up all night knitting a red carpet.The Fianna Fáil leader couldn’t let the occasion pass without making some mention of him, although he didn’t mention the court case even though it is finished so he wouldn’t be prejudicing anything. He returned to his favourite topic: whether the government has a sneaky little voting deal with independents such as Lowry. This is something Micheál Martin has long suspected and nothing Leo Varadkar says will convince him otherwise. There may not be anything down on paper, but he knows the Taoiseach “continues to hide information” on the little local sweeteners he promises to the likes of Lowry and Sean Canney. He pointed out that Lowry has never voted against the government, which seems just a tad suspicious. Will Leo publish their agreement? “There is nothing to publish and nothing to hide” he replied, insisting there is no formal agreement with any of the independent deputies. There are “several” however who “generally support the government” and because of that they are allowed raise local or policy issues with ministers. “And if we can work on them, we do and where we can’t, we can’t.”“That’s a deal! That’s a deal!” chorused Micheál and his colleagues. Danny Healy-Rae wondered why they were getting so annoyed, as they have a confidence and supply agreement. “Sure you’ve a deal as well.”“Well, we’ve drawn the short straw” huffed Timmy Dooley.Unfortunately, after his 22 years facing difficult questions, Lowry wasn’t there to provide clarification on whether there exists a deal or a paper trail. A Moriartyesque state of affairs.He has always claimed he has “an understanding” with the current administration. Something the government denies. The Taoiseach then pointed out that no-deal Lowry doesn’t always vote with the government. Over the past two years, he has voted against on 10 occasions out of 170 (he wasn’t there for 89 of them). Finally, Socialist Ruth Coppinger mentioned the court convictions which crowned Lowry’s “fantastic” day. Strangely, nobody else wanted to touch them.She highlighted his tax offences for which he got “a chicken feed fine in the context of his wealth and a pat on the back from the judge rather than a rap on the knuckles, saying he was a great TD.”And as the leas Ceann Comhairle looking increasingly scandalised, she declared that workers all over the country will look at the case and conclude that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.Would the Taoiseach now “oblige judges not to give their own personal opinions about one of their own, but to actually prosecute serial tax offenders for tax evasion?” Pat the Cope Gallagher found his voice. “You can’t be referring to court judgments” he spluttered, “and making references such as that!”There had been a court case, deputy Lowry got a fair trial, a conviction followed, he was fined and barred from holding directorships, he said.It is the job of the courts to hear cases. Politicians do not overrule judges. “We’re not Soviet Russia.” And that’s all he was going to say about Michael Lowry.Except that “tax offences and tax crimes are serious crimes in my view and the view of the government.

He will take up office in September.Ms McDonald said Mr Harris had to earn that trust, “particularly in relation to his involvement with legacy cases.“He has to demonstrate he in no way subscribes to the toxic, vindictive policing culture which necessitated the disbanding of the RUC.”She referred to concerns voiced by victims of “British state violence” and comments on Mr Harris’s approach to the issue by Miami Showband massacre survivor Stephen Travers, who spoke of “the old RUC culture of political policing and cover-up”.She said similar concerns were raised by the Relatives for Justice campaign group, who said that “Mr Harris has at every opportunity sought to thwart families in the search for truth and accountability, that he has had a stranglehold on legacy and acted partially and with vested interest”.Ms McDonald said she wanted to acknowledge that Mr Harris “comes to this with his own story of loss and pain from the conflict in the North and that cannot be minimised”. Mr Harris’s father, an RUC officer, was killed in an IRA car bomb in 1989. His mother survived the attack.The Taoiseach said he offered his sympathies to anyone and any family affected by the Troubles, “during that awful period of our history in which various organisations wrought violence”.He said: “I think Drew Harris is going to be someone who can really bring about better policing in Ireland and greater accountability.“He was very much involved in the transition from the RUC to the PSNI, which I think we all agree has been a big success and I think he can bring those abilities to the Garda Síochána.”Mr Varadkar expressed his disappointment in Ms McDonald’s remarks. He said that “truth and reconciliation requires that everyone plays their part, that everyone who has information about crimes that were committed in the past, about atrocities involved, should bring that information forward and that applies to Sinn Féin and all of the people associated with Sinn Féin as much as it does to anyone else”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3544772.1530036229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"airline moves women from seats due to ultra orthodox passengers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGonen Usishkin, El Al’s chief executive, said that in future “any passenger who refuses to sit next to another passenger will be ejected from the flight at once”.A leading Israeli tech company has stopped flying with the national carrier El Al after the airline moved women from their seats because ultra-Orthodox passengers refused to sit next to them.The incident occurred last week on a flight from New York to Tel Aviv which was delayed for over an hour when the ultra-Orthodox men, called haredim in Hebrew, boarded just before take-off and refused to sit in their allotted seats next to female passengers.A Facebook post by Chen Rotem, a passenger on the flight, went viral. He said the four men wouldn’t even look at or speak to female flight attendants who tried to intervene. Stewards then approached passengers row by row, asking them to switch seats.“After a lot of yelling and manoeuvering an elderly American woman and a young Israeli woman agreed to switch seats, allowing the flight to finally take off,” he wrote.One of the men was “particularly devout – he boarded the plane with his eyes closed tightly, led by his friend, and stayed that way the entire flight”, Mr Rotem said, adding that other religious men on the flight expressed “shock and revulsion” at the behaviour of the four men.Barak Eilam, chief executive of Nice Systems, one of Israel’s largest tech companies, said it did not do business with companies that discriminated based on race, gender or religion, so the company would not fly El Al until it changed its “practice and actions discriminating against] women”.El Al chief executive Gonen Usishkin praised the flight staff for handling the incident with “proper sensitivity” but added that in future “any passenger who refuses to sit next to another passenger will be ejected from the flight at once”.Two years ago, Renee Rabinowitz, an 80-year-old Holocaust survivor, was represented by the progressive Israel Religious Action Center (Irac) in a lawsuit against El Al after she was pressured by a flight attendant to move because an ultra-Orthodox man refused to sit next to her.Israel’s supreme court ruled that asking passengers to move their seat based on gender was a form of discrimination. The court also requested that El Al train their crew members to prevent such occurrences.Irac accused El Al of breaking its commitments in the latest incident and said the female passengers who were forced to move could sue the airline."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546017.1530126663!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"outlook not great for hard brexiteers of may s cabinet","story":"There was a torpid quality to prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, with empty seats scattered throughout the chamber and both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn below their unexceptional best. With cabinet members knocking lumps out of one another in public all week, the Labour leader had a wealth of material to choose from as he tormented the prime minister by quoting her own ministers’ remarks back to her.Corbyn portrayed the Conservatives’ feuding over Brexit as evidence that the government is unable to agree a common position as the time left to negotiate is measured in weeks rather than months. But a moment of resolution may be approaching, and it isn’t looking auspicious for the hard Brexiteers in May’s cabinet.Next week’s away day at Chequers will not, as Corbyn suggested on Wednesday, be a “pyjama party” but a one-day meeting where, according to No 10, the dress code will be business attire. May has invited the full cabinet, where a majority favour a softer Brexit, rather than just the Brexit subcommittee, where hardliners are now a majority.They are due to discuss outstanding issues in the negotiations, including what Britain wants in terms of regulatory alignment, ahead of the publication of a white paper outlining the government’s position on the future relationship with the EU.The white paper is due to be published in the week of July 9th, a few days after the Chequers meeting, so ministers will have little time to influence its contents. May and her allies want the cabinet to give Britain’s negotiators latitude to push for closer regulatory alignment with the EU than many hard Brexiteers believe is compatible with the referendum result or with the red lines the prime minister laid out in her Lancaster House speech last year.May compromised those red lines – no customs union, no single market, no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice – in her Mansion House speech this year. The white paper is likely to move her further away from those preconditions, calling for regulatory alignment for goods.Business secretary Greg Clark went further this week, calling for single market access for services and a “labour mobility framework” that sounds suspiciously like free movement.For their part, the Brexiteers will seek to lay down new, deep crimson lines that will fix the ne plus ultra to the march of the prime minister’s compromises on the way to a Brexit deal later this year.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

national service promote sense civic duty","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFrench President Emmanuel Macron at the \u0026#34prise d\u0026#39armes\u0026#34 military ceremony France is to bring back month-long national service for all 16-year-olds to promote social cohesion and national pride. But critics say the move is a costly fudge that falls well short of Emmanuel Macron’s initial plan to reintroduce a form of military service.Mr Macron, the French president, had mooted the idea of a form of national service in his electoral manifesto, saying it would be “useful to society but also to the youth who does it”, citing the merits of “commitment and living together”. The new service will come in two stages. The first is an obligatory one-month placement, consisting of two weeks in collective housing to promote a “social mix”, and then another two weeks in smaller, more “personalised” groups, according to Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister.This compulsory phase will take place partly during France’s long school holidays.  An optional second phase lasting three to 12 months will be on offer for under 25-year-olds who “wish to get more committed”.French President Emmanuel Macron has several hurdles to overcome before the policy is implemented It could be in the the fields as erse as “defence, environment, caring, tutoring and culture”, said Mr Blanquer.In return, participants will benefit from “varied and targeted” incentives, such as university credits or funding.A series of consultations will take place in October among French youth, parents, teachers’ unions and local government before deciding just how the compulsory phase will work.The new national service could start as early as next summer and be ramped up to 700,000 participants by 2026, a working group on the issue recommended.In the  2017 presidential campaign, Mr Macron had suggested that all French citizens should have direct experience of military life for a minimum of one month between the ages of 18 and 21.That has been watered down to what has been dubbed Universal National Service - partly due to concerns that it would be too costly and overburden France’s armed forces.French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer presented the national service universel to the press on WednesdayThe programme is estimated to cost €1.6bn (£1.4bn) a year to run, with €1.75bn of investment up front.The announcement drew ire from the political opposition, with Marine Le Pen, head of the newly-renamed National Rally (ex-Front National) calling it “pointless”.She said three months was a minimum to instill a sense of patriotism and promote social cohesion, as well as potentially “learning to handle weapons”, and that anything less was not worth the time and money.Adrien Quatennens of Leftist group France Unbowed called it mere “tinkering” as the government set “no aim” and had only a “limited budget”.There are potential legal pitfalls too amid warnings that the French constitution bans the state from forcing an entire plank of the population to spend time away from home, except for reasons of national defence.The plan has broad public backing, some 60 per cent of the French support it according to a YouGov poll, but the numbers drop to below half when younger people’s views are taken into account.Mr Macron is the first French president not to have done military service, scrapped in 1996 when he was 18.Please review our commenting policySaddleworth Moor fire: Army called in and residents struggle to breathe as toxic smoke sweeps over homesNew drug could stop thousands of women dying every year after giving birthBritain \u0026#39heading for worst possible Brexit\u0026#39 over freedom of movement, warns Theresa May\u0026#39s former top aideFirst manslaughter conviction for DNP diet pill dealer after toxic pills killed student Melania Trump could visit British school to talk about bullying as a \u0026#39standalone\u0026#39 event on UK tourVillagers in Wales with slow internet dig own trenches to install superfast broadbandSyrian air strikes knock out hospitals in rebel-held Daraa as Russian-backed offensive gathers pace£200m hoard found in homes of ousted Malaysia PM Najib RazakDonald Trump to hold summit with Vladimir PutinThe highs and lows of Diego MaradonaMerkel under pressure on the eve of EU migration summitBelize coral reef moved off \u0026#39threatened\u0026#39 list after years of conservation workJustice Anthony Kennedy, pivotal swing vote on US Supreme Court, retiresBoris Becker blocks sale of memorabilia as lawyers say it would strip him of \u0026#39personal dignity\u0026#39 on eve of WimbledonAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: From bartender to brave new hope for the Democrat Left in WashingtonHeadteacher introduces \u0026#39enrichment\u0026#39 week so parents can take children   on term time holidaysPrescription drug use \u0026#34soaring\u0026#34 in Africa, warns UNComment: Tony Blair is going to keep on saying Brexit is bad – until, out of sheer boredom, we give inFirefighters say bosses should be the ones questioned over Grenfell  Mortuaries stocking up on extra large fridges because bodies are too fat to fit in themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000167177224_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXEV_sfBtNwNi-kYoLncUqLRu4mT9z4W4YD5HWJpxVAg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"north korea improving nuclear facilities promising denuclearise","story":"digitalservices@telegraphUS President Donald Trump makes a statement before saying goodbye to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after their meetings in SingaporeNorth Korea is carrying out rapid improvements to its nuclear research facility, a monitor said on Wednesday, despite declaring a commitment to denuclearisation of the peninsula at the Singapore summit.The nuclear-armed North\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un promised to work toward the goal at a landmark summit in the city-state earlier this month with US President Donald Trump.But the Singapore meeting failed to clearly define denuclearisation or produce a specific timeline towards dismantling the North\u0027s atomic weapons arsenal.Mr Trump claimed the process would start quickly, saying last week that it will be a total denuclearisation, which is already taking place.But recent satellite imagery showed that not only were operations continuing at present at the North\u0027s main Yongbyon nuclear site, it was also carrying out infrastructure works, said the respected 38 North website.Commercial satellite imagery from June 21 indicates that improvements to the infrastructure at...

where it had staged six atomic tests - in a show of goodwill before the summit.But Pyongyang has kept its counsel on the denuclearisation issue since the meeting, although state media have dialled down propaganda against the US, long dubbed the imperialist enemy.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been pushing for more follow-up talks to flesh out details over denuclearisation but no date has been set for when they would take place.Shortly after the summit with Kim, Mr Trump declared that there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.A tunnel of Punggye-ri nuclear test ground is blown up during the dismantlement processBut highlighting the apparent gap between Trump\u0027s rhetoric and the facts on the ground, his administration on Friday extended decade-old sanctions against Kim\u0027s regime, citing the extraordinary threat from the North\u0027s nuclear arsenal.Mr Trump also ruffled feathers by abruptly announcing a halt to joint military drills with the ally the South after the Singapore summit, calling the exercises provocative to the North and very expensive.It took the Pentagon several hours to confirm the surprise decision, and the drills were only officially cancelled two weeks after the summit.Now the US Defense Secretary James Mattis is set to visit Seoul on Thursday to discuss the issue with his South Korean counterpart.Mr Mattis, currently on his first-ever trip to China, will fly to Japan after visiting Seoul as part of his Asian tour.Please review our commenting policySaddleworth Moor fire: Army called in and residents struggle to breathe as toxic smoke sweeps over homesNew drug could stop thousands of women dying every year after giving birthBritain \u0026#39heading for worst possible Brexit\u0026#39 over freedom of movement, warns Theresa May\u0026#39s former top aideFirst manslaughter conviction for DNP diet pill dealer after toxic pills killed student Melania Trump could visit British school to talk about bullying as a \u0026#39standalone\u0026#39 event on UK tourVillagers in Wales with slow internet dig own trenches to install superfast broadbandSyrian air strikes knock out hospitals in rebel-held Daraa as Russian-backed offensive gathers paceFrance to bring back National Service to promote sense of civic duty£200m hoard found in homes of ousted Malaysia PM Najib RazakDonald Trump to hold summit with Vladimir PutinThe highs and lows of Diego MaradonaMerkel under pressure on the eve of EU migration summitBelize coral reef moved off \u0026#39threatened\u0026#39 list after years of conservation workJustice Anthony Kennedy, pivotal swing vote on US Supreme Court, retiresBoris Becker blocks sale of memorabilia as lawyers say it would strip him of \u0026#39personal dignity\u0026#39 on eve of WimbledonAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: From bartender to brave new hope for the Democrat Left in WashingtonHeadteacher introduces \u0026#39enrichment\u0026#39 week so parents can take children   on term time holidaysPrescription drug use \u0026#34soaring\u0026#34 in Africa, warns UNComment: Tony Blair is going to keep on saying Brexit is bad – until, out of sheer boredom, we give inFirefighters say bosses should be the ones questioned over Grenfell  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/21/08/rock.jpg  width= 1035  height= 668  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/21/08/rock.jpg","title":"oumuamua asteroid comet object identity interstellar solar system nasa astronomy","story":"Created with Sketch.Despite lacking a distinctive \u0027tail\u0027, space rock from beyond our solar system is likely a comet, scientists concludeClick to followThe Independent OnlineOumuamua: scientists finally decide on real identity of mysterious interstellar objectAfter months of speculation about the identity of Oumuamua, or\u0026nbspthe first “alien” object from outside our solar system, scientists have come to a conclusion about what it is.\u0026nbspThe space rock first identified by astronomers in November, has been variously described as an asteroid, a new variety of “interstellar object” and even an alien spacecraft.\u0026nbspBut new tests have revealed it is in fact a comet, despite lacking some of the key characteristics that would normally allow experts to identify such an astronomical body.“From theoretical models we were expecting interstellar objects to be mostly cometary, on the basis of the region of the planetary systems where they form,” said Dr Marco Micheli from the European Space Agency“However, Oumuamua did not look as a comet in optical images we obtained, since it did not have a coma or a tail. This led to a reclassification of it as an asteroid.”While asteroids are made up of rock and metals, comets form from ice, dust and rocky fragments and move through space in a different way.Oumuamua lacked the tail that forms as comets melt and release gases and dust, meaning it was difficult to determine what exactly it was.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening

It’s likely that thousands of tribespeople in what is now Scotland (mainly from the Caledonian and Maeatae tribal confederations) were killed.The Romans claimed that the native chieftains had reneged on a peace agreement – and were therefore rebels, not just ordinary enemies. It is likely that the sacred bronze hand was ritually buried by one of the Roman commanders who had taken part in the conflict.Rome’s indignation (feigned or real), over the natives reneging on the peace agreement, was particularly acute because the 50,000 strong invasion had been led by none other than the reigning emperor himself – an ex-general called Septimius Severus. His personal political credibility was therefore very much at stake. The war, associated with the newly discovered bronze “hand of god”, was therefore a particularly bitter one.To evoke the anger apparently felt by the Romans, a famous Roman writer of the time, Cassius Dio, when writing his account of the conflict, put a particularly bloodcurdling speech (borrowed from the Iliad – the epic ancient Greek tale of the Trojan War, traditionally ascribed to Homer) into the mouth of the Emperor.In Dio’s account, the borrowed speech instructs the Roman army to annihilate the Scottish tribes. “We are not going to leave a single one of them alive, down to the babies in their mothers’ wombs – not even they must live.

His bronze hand was often mounted on the top of a poll – and used to bless or sanctify his followers during religious rituals inside his temples.Dolichenus, before conservation (Vindolanda Trust)It had been deposited in a small bog almost certainly as part of a religious ritual to mark the completion of a temple dedicated to the god just 15m\u0026nbspaway.The cult must have been particularly important to the regiment based at Vindolanda or its commander – because the temple was very unusually built inside the fort. It is the only example of such a phenomenon known from anywhere in the Roman empire.The regiment based there was a Gaulish (French) originating unit of auxiliary infantry and cavalry – known as the fourth\u0026nbspcohort of Gauls.\u0026nbspIts commanding officer, a wealthy upper-class Roman called Sulpicius Pudens (potentially the one in post when the temple was constructed and the bronze hand deposited) appears to have been a particularly devoted follower of the cult. He personally funded one of the two main altars inside the Vindolanda Fort temple and another altar (probably also associated with Jupiter Dolichenus) at a nearby sulphur spring.The unique decision (possibly by Sulpicius Pudens himself) to build the temple inside the fort and the associated ritual deposition of the god’s bronze hand – both immediately following the end of the largest military combat operation ever to take place in Britain – was almost certainly not a coincidence.Vindolanda Trust)As probable thanksgivings for survival and victory, they represent additional evidence of the epic and almost certainly particularly brutal nature of the military campaign.Roman military operations varied considerably in terms of their treatment of rebel and other populations.Occasionally, they were particularly brutal and more rarely downright genocidal. The most lethal campaigns in Roman history included the siege and complete destruction of Carthage (146 BC) in which 200,000 people died, the mass crucifixion of 6,000 captured slaves at the end of Spartacus’ war (71 BC), Julius Caesar ‘s massacre of the Rhineland tribes (55 BC) in which up to 400,000 were killed, the Jewish revolt of 70 AD\u0026nbspin which hundreds of thousands died (including thousands of prisoners who were crucified) and the second Jewish revolt of 132-135 AD\u0026nbspin which up to 600,000 died.The campaign in Scotland was unusually massive, emperor-led and probably very aggressive and brutal – but no credible figures on casualties on either side have survived and may indeed never even have been aggregated and recorded.Certainly, just prior to the main huge invasion, the Romans switched tactics from paying diplomatic bribes and sweeteners to Scotland’s tribes to carrying out overt military actions. Some of the diplomatic bribes – hoards of Roman silver coins – are on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.Vindolanda. It features a portrait of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus – the man who ordered and led the invasion (Vindolanda Trust)Archaeological evidence (the locations of diplomatic gifts of silver coinage pre-and post invasion) also suggests that the war permanently altered the geopolitical tribal balance – so it is therefore likely that specific tribal groups were at least politically (and possibly physically) neutralised from the regions geopolitical equations.“It was almost certainly one of the most brutal military campaigns ever fought on British soil. It’s likely that future archaeological investigations over the coming years will reveal the full horror of this long-forgotten conflict,” said archaeologist and historian Dr Simon Elliott, author of a new book on the war,\u0026nbspSeptimius Severus in Scotland: the Northern Campaigns of the First Hammer of the Scots.Fascinatingly and ironically, it is likely that the Roman invasion of Scotland which was meant to solve military and political problems (and partially succeeded in doing so for several decades) destabilised and destroyed the Scottish geopolitical status quo and ultimately helped lead to the rise of the Picts who in the end constituted a much greater threat to Roman Britain and ultimately helped destroy it. Although the invasion and its consequences occurred more than 1500 years ago, they demonstrate how military actions that may appear logical at the time often end up having longer term implications that the politicians (in this case a Roman emperor) had not envisaged or prepared for.Why ancient Roman vineyards are reopening in eastern GaliciaRoman mosaics ruined in botched restoration jobTourists caught carving initials onto walls of ancient Roman Colosseum before taking a selfieIn this case, Septimius Severus\u0026nbspdied before the conflict had been fully resolved – and his sons, who succeeded him, had absolutely no interest in Britain and quickly returned to the fraught political rather than military fray in Rome (the elder son murdering his younger brother just 11 months after their father’s death).“The discovery of Jupiter Dolichenus’ bronze hand, deposited as a thanksgiving offering, demonstrates just how serious the conflict was and how relieved the Roman soldiers were that it had ended,” says\u0026nbspDr Andrew Birley, director of the Vindolanda excavations.“It is further evidence illustrating how deeply religious they were and how seriously they took their relationship with their god,” he says.The bronze hand will be on permanent display at Vindolanda Museum as from today.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An existing\u0026nbspstate of emergency, they\u0026nbspstressed, also limited freedom of expression and assembly for political parties.The delegation from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\u0026nbspcomplained that some monitors were obstructed in carrying out their work. Ignacio\u0026nbspSanchez Amor, the group’s special coordinator, said it was “utterly unacceptable” that two members of the team were denied entry into the country.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultMr Erdogan described the election process as “an example to the rest of the world”. In his victory speech he returned to a recurring theme in his campaign: that he was the leader to\u0026nbspstand up for Turkey against western powers. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God, you have given a lesson to those who want for Turkey to kneel,” he told his cheering followers. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”Foreign interference and sabotage had been blamed by Mr Erdogan and his supporters for a range of the country’s ills, including the plummeting national currency, the Lira. The president, who had said he would play a key role in forming economic policy in his new administration, declared that vast infrastructure developments\u0026nbspbeing undertaken will lead to massive boosts in employment and growth. The projects include Kanal Istanbul, a 45 kilometre channel linking the Black and Marmara\u0026nbspseas and the airport to replace Istanbul’s Ataturk, provisionally named the New Istanbul Airport, but, it is claimed in local media, which may end up being called\u0026nbspErdogan Airport.The conflicts\u0026nbspagainst Kurdish militants home and abroad are set to continue,\u0026nbspwith new operations planned. The mission was to “fight terrorist organisations” and\u0026nbsp“to continue the fight to make Syrian grounds freer”, Mr Erdogan said. Fresh offensives are also expected to be launched against Kurdish fighters in the southeast of the country. “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” the president\u0026nbspsaid. “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.”Erdogan proclaimed winner of Turkey’s presidential electionThe pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeoples’\u0026nbspDemocratic Party (HDP)\u0026nbspbroke through the 10 per cent barrier in the elections and so\u0026nbspwill have a significant number of MPs in parliament. Nine of its newly elected MPs, including the leader, Selahattin Demirtas, have been imprisoned.\u0026nbspThe HDP\u0026nbspgains\u0026nbspwere expected to make the opposition groups the majority in parliament,\u0026nbspbut Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party did better than expected as did its allies, the far-right\u0026nbspNationalist\u0026nbspAction Party\u0026nbspwho secured\u0026nbspdouble the support polls had forecast. This means the ruling coalition will keep control.The election wins\u0026nbspkeep 64-year-old Mr Erdogan in office until 2023, the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. He can then, under the new constitution, run for another term as president, and one more if he were to call an early election. Thus\u0026nbspallowing him to stay president, theoretically, until 2032, easily surpassing the tenure of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.During\u0026nbspthe election campaign Mr Erdogan had mooted that the state of emergency, brought in following the failed coup blamed on exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, would be lifted. More than 50,000 people remain in prison and another 140,000 have been suspended or fired from their jobs.Turkey’s democracy isn’t over yet, but it will be soonErdogan declared winner of Turkey\u0027s presidential electionSix arrested for ‘insulting Erdogan’ as polls open in Turkey electionsThe president has not given a timeframe for the easing of the punitive measures or any indication on whether they would be lifted totally.\u0026nbspHis new powers, in any event, allow\u0026nbsphim to impose draconian measures with minimal interference from the judiciary.There were some among opposition supporters who would rather not wait to see whether there would be an outbreak of benevolence from the president after his victory.Adem Bulent, a 20-year-old student and CHP supporter, said he has begun to explore whether he can finish his studies abroad. It was not just the defeat which disappointed him, but the way the political parties accepted it. “They talked about how unfair it was, they talked about vote rigging, then this happens against all the expectations, and then –\u0026nbspnothing,” he said, waving\u0026nbsphis arms in exasperation. “I think the chance has come and gone, there is no point in pretending otherwise.”The extent of the gloom felt by those who expected change\u0026nbspwas expressed by an academic staring into his coffee on Monday morning at a cafe in Istanbul’s fashionable Nisantasi district. Suleiman had stayed up\u0026nbspmost of the night in front of the television with the forlorn hope of the figures changing. “Just how bad was it? Well let’s say for us it was Trump and Brexit rolled into one, that’s how bad it was,”\u0026nbspwas his damning verdict.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He should accept that he is partly responsible for Britain voting the way it did in 2016.Mr Blair is earning millions of pounds travelling the world and giving advice - but we\u0027re not paying and we won\u0027t be listening to him.Mr Blair\u0027s inflammatory remarks came in a speech at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank in London yesterday.Leave-backing Tory MP Nigel EvansThe former prime minister suggested that Mrs May should start planning to delay the March 2019 deadline for Brexit as a result of the political deadlock over the kind of deal the UK wants with Europe.He argued there was still the chance for Britain and Europe to strike a bargain which could see the UK staying in.We should plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline, he said.Presently, we are drifting towards March 2019 with no clear negotiating position, no resolution of the Northern Ireland question, still vaguely hoping Europe will allow us access to the single market without abiding by its rules which it will never do, and with senior Cabinet members openly debating the merits of a negotiating position which \u0027threatens\u0027 Europe with a no-deal Brexit.This is the equivalent of holding a negotiation on the top floor of a high-rise building and \u0027threatening\u0027 to jump out of the window if our demands are not met.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage.Mr Blair acknowledged that supporters of globalisation were under pressure from outspoken political groupings on the Right and Left campaigning against free trade, open-door migration and international cooperation.Once it is clear the populism isn\u0027t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work, he said.Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.He added: We are losing sight of the values which brought the West together, saw it through the menace of fascism and communism and, for all our justifiable grievances, have wrought immense progress.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage, says Tony BlairThe former prime minister continued: Brexit has become a metaphor for the debate around globalisation.The only way out of the cul-de-sac of populism is to understand that the case for globalisation will not succeed unless we deal with the underlying grievances of that part of the population for whom globalisation holds more fear than hope.Europe and Britain could strike a bargain which would see Europe reforming, which the European people plainly by their votes are demanding, and Britain staying in such a Europe.For Europe as well as for Britain, this means dealing with the issue of immigration decisively.For all nations, it will require more active government intervention, helping people and communities \u0027left behind\u0027.The Conservative MP is known for his upper-class mannerisms and traditionalist views                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10In a BBC interview ahead of his speech yesterday, Mr Blair said it was a huge myth the he had allowed uncontrolled immigration while prime minister but conceded he would take a tougher approach to movement within the EU.It\u0027s true we were in favour of freedom of movement within the European Union, though again, if I was back in office today I would be arguing we apply those rules much more toughly, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Reform Group of Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers, said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a very expensive bargain, if we were foolish enough to listen to Mr Blair and re-join then we would lose our remaining rebate.\u0026ldquoThe other half he gave away for a phantasmagorical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but he has always been better at husbanding his own resources than those of taxpayers."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/traffic-uk-manchester-cycling-walking-network-980566.jpg","title":"traffic uk manchester cycling walking network transport for greater manchester","story":"Transport for Greater Manchester74 miles of busy roads could be uprooted in the Manchester schemeThe \u0026pound500million Beelines scheme will mean dozens of miles of A-roads in Greater Manchester could be uprooted.The scheme sets out plans for 1,400 sets of upgraded or new traffic lights and 75 miles of \u0026ldquoAmsterdam-style segregated bicycle lanes.Transport for Greater Manchester hopes the five-year scheme - which was launched today by Mayor Andy Burnham and ex Olympic gold medalist Chris Boardman - will help in creating \u0026ldquothe UK\u0026rsquos most comprehensive cycling and walking network.But the plans have sparked public outrage after it emerged at least 74 miles of \u0026ldquobusy roads, including the heavily congested A6 and A56 roads, are among those which face being dug up and being reduced in width to make way for cycling lanes.Roadworks will also cause delays - particularly at busy traffic junctions - as pavements and roads will be dug up as part of the scheme which aims to encourage bike use.

Not one of them was solved.The ex-cop, who has has been a victim himself, believes the high crime in the area is due to an underfunded police force and officers being forced to “turn a blind eye” to a lot of offences.He added: “Many crimes, such or burglaries or where people are going into empty houses and nicking the boilers and stripping away copper cable, simply can’t be investigated because they don’t have the resources.But there’s also a lot of apathy, to be honest.The problems in Burnley are by no means unique and the last six months has seen an explosion in violent crime on the UKs streets.Just this week a moped gang targeted a mother and her three-year-old daughter on the streets of leafy Richmond in London.But the problem has been growing for some time around Burnleys Leyland Road.Locals blame the transient population for much of the anti-social behaviour and crime and there is no doubt the many derelict buildings are a magnet for trouble.Shopkeeper Amjad Ali once had to fight off a burglar  who he caught red-handed kicking in his back door.He said: I’d got this phone call to say someone was in my back yard.When I asked this guy what he was doing, he said, ‘I didn’t know it was your house.’He punched me but I managed to hit him back before he ran off.On this particular occasion the police did manage to arrest the burglar - and it transpired he was a repeat offender and it was his 100th offence.In another terrifying attack, Amjads mother had a knife held to her throat in an armed robbery.Out of a total of nearly 5,900 neighbourhoods with more than 20 burglaries last year, cops failed to solve 3,105 cases – over half of the crimes.New figures show that seven out of ten burglary investigations were closed without police ever identifying a suspect.The shocking figures prompted the Police federation to comment that burglars were getting used to “never being stopped by police, never mind arrested.”The Sunday Times revealed the figures after carrying out an investigation examining crime figures for 34,250 neighbourhoods in England and Wales.Salisbury, Canterbury, Cambridge, Oxford and St Albans all have high rates of where burglaries go unsolved.The Police Federation operational policing leader Simon Kempton said the lack of funds were having a “massive effect” on the ability to solve crime.The 45-year-old said many crimes in Burnley itself simply went unreported while police ignore others simply due to a “lack of evidence”.Crack is a real problem, he said.People start taking it and they don’t realise the consequences. They end up getting hooked and then need money to pay for it.These people will watch someone’s house or just go walking by and realise it’s empty and break in and take whatever stuff they can so they can sell it and then buy drugs.As the police struggle to keep on top of the regular petty burglaries, some locals are instead stepping up their own private security to avoid becoming targets.Among them is Azhar Shah, whose home has been burgled four times in four years.Its gotten so bad he has installed CCTV cameras around his home to protect his family.Last year, thieves stole a £400 television when he popped out to visit his mother and he once woke up in the middle of the night to find raiders attempting to break in through the kitchen window.On another occasion his huge fridge freezer - plus its contents - vanished but when he rang police to report the crime he claims he was given a “ticking off” for using 999 because it “wasn’t an emergency”.“I keep a baseball in the house because I’m worried for my children,” he said.“I’ve lived here for 40 years and the easier thing would be to just move out.“But I don’t want the criminals to win.”He said the local bobby on the beat was fantastic at her job, but added: If we had more like her it would be great but the police just can’t be bothered investigating a lot of crimes.Burnley Councillor Sue Graham told The Sun Online it was down to more resources for local government and police to tackle the problem.She said: Its a problem that has persisted in areas where theres low income and a transient population.At the end of the day, it boils down the police forces.Last year, the Police Federation warned that police officers were taking as long as a week to respond to burglaries because of crippling staff shortages.Lancashire Police today insisted the data was misleading, saying many of the properties targeted were derelict with copper piping and boilers stolen.They said of the 109 reported burglaries, five people had been arrested but no further action had been taken.A spokesperson told The Sun Online: We have had jail terms of over 60 years since January for some of our most prolific burglars.We are also reinvesting in targeted crime teams across the county which will look specifically at tackling burglary."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415086540.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"iain duncan smith theresa may brexit talks","story":"Senior allies want the PM to seize ­control of negotiations now the flagship departure bill is set to become law.And if EU officials rebuff her demands, she should hand over her business card and say: “Call me if you change your minds. I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in. And there’s never been a better moment for her to do it than now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I never took a gap year and Id always fancied doing a bit of travelling - and what destination could be more adventurous than the final frontier?It only took a few hours before I heard back with the good news - Im in, which means I can vote on the direction of Asgardias future and, hopefully, be eligible to leave the planet one day when Asgardias first space expeditions get off the ground.Citizens from over 200 territories have applied to become Asgardians, and its current citizen count makes it the 172nd largest country in the world.Within 10 years, Asgardias leaders hope to have recruited 150 million people, and the dream is that the first ark - a satellite like the International Space Station - will be able to launch within a few decades time.Low Earth orbit is already well developed in terms of successful short-term human habitation, Lena De Winne, Asgardia’s Deputy Head of Administration, told us. However, for permanent habitation, we will need to address the issues of a lack of gravity and cosmic radiation.We’re planning on building space arks equipped with artificial gravity and shields from cosmic radiation and other space threats to allow for permanent human habitation.So far, the nation hasnt put anyone in space, but it has launched its own unmanned satellite, Asgardia-1, which is currently deployed in low-Earth orbit, moving at speeds of 7.6km per second.Next up, the country plans to establish its own digital currency, dubbed the solar, and bigger upcoming projects include designing a protective shield to guard humankind from space debris and asteroids.So far, the UN hasnt let Asgardia into the club of Earth-dwelling nations, but the nations founder says he is in informal talks with a few heads of state to get Asgardia recognised as a real country.Asgardia is the brainchild of Dr Igor Ashurbeyli, a billionaire Russian-Azerbaijani businessman and scientist who was formally inaugurated as Asgardias head of state at a grand ceremony at Viennas Hofburg Palace on Monday.Bizarrely, he was sworn in by former partner of Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia, Lembit Opik - a keen advocate of space exploration and one of Asgardias most high profile citizens.While his terrestrial political career is long over, Opik has been successfully elected to one of the 150 seats on the Asgardian parliament, along with Nigel Evans, President of the British Parliamentary Space Committee.“Today, it’s time to open space up economically, socially and culturally for all humankind, Opik says. That’s Asgardia’s mission.”“As the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the country is liberated to invest in a truly global space community, and the Government has recognised this with substantial investment in the UK space sector.“Asgardia welcomes British citizens who share the dream of human opportunities in space for all countries, not just the privileged few who can afford a presence in space.There was a time when only the British Upper Class could travel abroad. Now it’s possible for all to do it.Dr Yun Zhao, Asgardia’s Head of Supreme Court, told Sun Online: There is no law that says that a nation should be attached to the surface of the Earth. Therefore, we are able to say that we have our territory free from the surface of the Earth.We are a nation whose population happens to reside in different countries—there is no law that says that as a citizen of a nation you must live there, there is no law which states that a nation must be big enough to host all of its citizens at one time.Ashurbeyli fears Earth will soon be destroyed by environmental degradation or a catastrophic nuclear war, and so he thinks its important that humanity can leave the planet before its too late.As such, he wants to start again with his own country and put space politics over geopolitics... a grand ambition which he has bankrolled entirely on his own so far.A qualified engineer, Azerbaijan-born Dr Igor Ashurbeyli made his fortune in a string of successful tech businesses.His exact net worth is not known, but its widely reported that Ashurbeyli is comfortably in the billionaire club.He founded software company Socium in 1988, before moving to Moscow to work with a string of military and scientific companies.Hes previously worked as a consultant for the UN, advising on how to protect Earth from asteroids and space threats, and he has edited an international space journal, ROOM, since 2014.Space has been a lifelong passion, and hes poured his own money into Asgardia, which he formally founded around 20 months ago.  In the future, he plans on charging a 100 euro annual citizenship fee, as well as collecting income and business taxes from members, to sustain the grand and expensive Asgardian dream.There are also plans to one day vet citizens by IQ, but at this point it looks like Asgardia will take anyone they can get, so long as theyre committed to a future away from our planet.The timeline for leaving Earth behind? Just 25 years, by which time Ashurbeyli hopes to establish a permanent human settlement on the moon.In the meantime, hes trying to find some political backing for Asgardia on the world stage, and iron out pesky admin stuff... like actually building life-supporting arks and getting millions of people into space.“This day will certainly be recorded in the annals of the greatest events in the history of humankind,” Ashurbeyli said in his inaugural speech.“We have thus established all branches of government.

Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

consisting of around 20,000 car washes nationwide - is rife with exploitation.At one site staff were forced to live on spare change vacuumed from underneath car seats, the Times reported.Victims are often brought over from Eastern Europe on the promise of paid work and a better life in the UK.But many have their passports seized or are threatened to stop them running away.Dr Jardine, a researcher at the University of Nottinghams Rights Lab, said workers are often forced into debt to their captors who claim they are owed money for their accommodation or transport.In many cases their accommodation is little more than a mattress in an over-occupied house — or a foul illegal tenement.Romanian slave worker Sandu Laurentiu-Sava, 40, died after being electrocuted in a rat-infested shower behind a car wash in Bethnal Green, East London.In January his boss Shaip Nimani, 52, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for four years.And in April two Czech brothers-in-law were convicted on slavery charges after forcing workers to wash cars in Cardiff for little or no money.Roman Feko and Ladislav Fedak targeted homeless or vulnerable men, driving one to attempt suicide after learning he was bought like a piece of furniture, the BBC reported.Mihai, another Romanian slave worker, was forced to wash cars in Cumbria for 11-hours a day with no breaks — for as little as £30, the Evening Standard reported.Fuel retail industry representative Teresa Sayers said the cost of a car wash for a legal business to break even is around £6.40.It means drivers paying less than this are likely funding an exploitative firm.She told the environmental audit committee: If everything is very, very cheap it is clearly an indication that they are cutting corners or somebody is being exploited.If you are to do a more in-depth valet its about £12, and thats without making any money.A Nottingham Business School study of 45 hand car washes found none paid the national minimum wage.Earlier this month the Anglican and Catholic churches in England urged the public to report suspicious car washes to the police to tackle slavery.They launched The Safe Car Wash app to help drivers identify signs of forced labour.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described modern slavery as a scourge which is damaging so many people’s lives."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416504971.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emmanuel macron forces french schoolkids to learn about europes flag and anthem to stop the country following us out of eu","story":"Children from the age of six to 12 will be taught more about how Europe was created to try and ward of Euroscepticism, under new plans drawn up by Emmanuel Macron.The changes to the French curriculum are hoped to ward people who were born into the families of people who immigrated to the country from being indoctrinated by hateful preachers.Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister, wants pupils from the age of 6 to learn La Marseillaise, as well as the origins of Frances flag.And to avoid any temptations about a possible Frexit, they will also be taught about the EUs flag and be able to recognise the blocs anthem, Ode to Joy, which Macron played on his election night.The changes will be rolled out across the country in the autumn, and will try to make sure their kids grow up to be Europeans and patriots of France.By the age of 10 pupils will be expected to sing the songs in public and know what democracy means.And their final year of primary education will include being taught about obeying the law, paying taxes and respecting others.When they get into secondary school they will be taught more about the meaning of Europe and what it means to be a European.The new programme is being drawn up by the education ministry as part of plans to counter radical Islamic extremism.But primary schools have had to teach La Marseillaise from 2005.Today Theresa May announced that No10 would proudly fly the England flag on days where were playing key World Cup matches -

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Princess Alice of Battenberg, as she was known, requested her final resting place to be on Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives, a wish that was finally realised in 1988. Before her death in 1969, Alice, the mother of Prince Philip, had lived an extraordinary life, which included sheltering a Jewish widow and her two children in German-occupied Athens during the Second World War. She secretly ferried them food and messages of the war-torn outside world for 13 months. During his Middle East trip William spent time privately with Evy and Philippe Cohen, who told him how she had sheltered Evy\u0027s great grandmother Rachel Cohen and Rachel\u0027s daughter, Tilde, in Athens during the German occupation of Greece. Mr Cohen said: “We all owe our existence to her courage.” Philippe, 31, and Evy, 62, are descended from the sons of Rachel, who left Greece to join the resistance once they knew their mother and sister were safely hidden. Princess Alice has been honoured by the Jewish people for saving a family from Nazi persecution despite the risks to her own family\u0027s lives.  But hers was always destined to be a singular life and was, from the very start, extraordinary. She was born in the Tapestry Room of Windsor Castle in 1885 with her great-grandmother Queen Victoria in the room. Her father was the German Prince Louis and her mother a British princess - Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven - so Alice was related to most royal families in Europe. Aged eight Alice was diagnosed with deafness and learned to lip read. Relatives believed her deafness made her more empathetic and sensitive towards those who seemed isolated. In 1902 at the coronation of her cousin King Edward VII in London Alice met and fell in love with then Prince Andrew of Greece. When they married the following year she gained her second title, Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark. The eldest of their five children is Prince Philip, William’s grandfather. But it was not to be a happy union.  After her husband was exiled from his native Greece to France, blamed for military failures in a war with Turkey between 1919-22, Alice’s marriage hit the buffers. She suffered a nervous breakdown and in 1930 was forcibly removed from her family and treated for schizophrenia in a Swiss mental institution. In that time her son, Prince Philip, moved to Britain to live with his uncles Louis and George Mountbatten. Her three daughters all married German princes who later fought with the Nazis but she did not attend their weddings. Alice never lived with her husband again and later settled alone in Greece, where she worked to help poor people. There she reconnected with old friend Haimaki Cohen, a Jewish member of the Greek Parliament, his wife Rachel, and their family. Sensing increasing anti-Semitism in Europe, she promised to help the Cohens if ever they needed aid. In 1943, as the Germans were rounding up Jews in Greece, Rachel was now widowed and desperately needed that help. Hearing of their plight, Alice hid Rachel, her daughter Tilde and later her son Michael in her small apartment. It was an extremely risky move, not least because the apartment was in the shadows of the Gestapo office in Athens. Princess Alice moved in to a separate building, where she worked as a caretaker, and trusted only a few people to help look after the Cohens. During the Nazi occupation of Athens in 1943, some assumed that Alice was pro-German. But when one general asked: “Is there anything I can do for you?” She replied: “You can take your troops out of my country.” In 1947 Princess Alice attended the wedding of her son Philip to Princess Elizabeth in London. Her three daughters were not invited because of the strong anti-German sentiment in the country .

The route, which snakes through the dusty streets of Bethlehem, passes watchtowers, refugee camps, and barbed wire fences. It weaves past checkpoints, piles of rubble, and the Church of Nativity, built on the spot where Jesus is supposed to have been born. Most notably of all, the route can only go 11km before it needs to double back on itself.  In war-torn Palestine, there isn’t a stretch of road longer than this that doesn\u0027t meet with a wall or one of Israeli government’s checkpoints.  Completing the full 42km marathon route therefore involves running back and forth along the same stretch of road, often in the shadow of the graffiti covered wall that runs 440 miles along the whole of the West Bank.  ‘We live in a city with borders we cannot escape,’ says Aseel Baidoun, a 28 year-old Palestinian runner. ‘In each direction you have a checkpoint, a settlement or an 8m high cement wall. It’s choking, and running feels like my only way to breathe.’ It’s this lack of freedom of movement that Scottish film-makers Cairsti Russell and Stephen Sheriff hope to highlight in a new documentary that aims to humanise the politically fraught situation in the West Bank. Working closely with Palestinian pressure group Right to Movement, the pair plan to bring the everyday struggles of Palestinians to a new audience.  At it’s heart, Freedom to Run will be a documentary about the friendship that blooms between a group of Scottish and Palestinian runners as they take part in two very different marathons: one in Palestine, and, two months later, one in Edinburgh.   ‘Of course, there is a huge disparity between life here and there,’ says Cairsti, who is currently studying for a PhD focusing on media coverage of the Israeli Palestine conflict. ‘But then at the same time there are so many ways that there is no disparity at all – we share so many similarities, and that was one of the important things I wanted to get across.’ It’s hard to imagine a marathon route that sits in more of a stark contrast to Palestine than Edinburgh. The Scottish capital’s famous route meanders gently past Georgian townhouses and treelined parks, along cherry blossom lined walkways and around the base of the famous inactive volcano Arthur’s Seat. ‘Running in Scotland was a bitter-sweet experience,’ says Aseel. ‘I was jealous of Scottish people, and kept asking myself why I hadn’t been born in Glasgow, where I can just wear my shorts and run. Life is so easy there, there’s nothing to worry about except the weather. Waking up in the morning, putting on shorts and jogging past trees, rivers, and grass is everything I could wish for.’  ‘In the West Bank, we don’t have parks, sea shores or forests to run in. We have the streets, that mostly lack sidewalks, so we run inhaling the smoke of cars. There’s no way to reach the sea or forests due to the checkpoints and separation wall that surrounds our city, and we can’t run in mountain tracks due to the settlements that are built there.’ It’s a fraught political situation: since the 1990s, the Israeli government has built hundreds of checkpoints and claim that they are needed to prevent Palestinian gunmen and suicide bombers from entering the country.  This month marks 51 years since the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, with the current death toll from the ensuing conflict standing at more than 8,000.   The separation wall, built in 2000, was deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice in 2004, and, according to a report from human rights watchdog Amnesty International , it\u0027s prevented heavily pregnant women from making it to midwives, bridegrooms from attending their own weddings, and dying children from reaching hospitals in time.   Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen says: \u0027Israel’s legitimate right to defend its people cannot justify imposing hundreds and hundreds of checkpoints on Palestinian land. Contrary to official claims about Israel’s overall “security” needs, the checkpoints and restricted West Bank roads appear to exist mainly for the benefit of Israel’s settlements, settlements that are themselves illegal under international law.\u0027 There are currently 522 of these checkpoints in use, and Palestinians are required to carry ID at all times. ‘The day before the Scottish marathon, we were getting ready to travel from Glasgow to Edinburgh,’ says Diala Isid, 28, who heads up Palestinian pressure group Right to Movement and took part in the both marathons. ‘One of the runners asked me if we should take our passports with us. Immediately without any thinking, I said yes, because in Palestine we always get stopped and checked by the Israeli soldiers. We can’t travel from any city to another without having our identification card so it just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t need them here either.’  Diala, like 4 out of 5 Palestinians, cannot remember a time before occupation, having grown up under a system that sees Israeli security forces exert control over 2.6 million Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza. She\u0027s only ever known one set of laws for Palestinians, another for Israelis. For the Scottish runners, seeing the way that Palestinian runners’ lives were inhibited was a huge shock. On an early morning visit to the notorious Checkpoint 300, where thousands of Palestinians queue for hours in cramped conditions on their daily commute to East Jerusalem, the British runners were horrified to see how tough conditions are. ‘It’s horrible to see this,’ says Caitlin Brennan. ‘It reminds me of images you see from Calais where people are taking a once in a lifetime risk to try and completely change their lives, rather than something they have to do every single day.’  But there were also life-affirming moments on both trips, like seeing a Palestinian hip hop show together, being welcomed into people’s family homes, and hearing the crowds cheering on the Scottish flag. In Glasgow, a taxi driver refused to accept any money from the runners when he found out where they were from. The runners formed a tight bond, regularly chatting and comparing training notes over Skype. When Aseel got married in between the marathons, the other runners joked that the couple were having a running honeymoon. In Edinburgh, Aseel and her new husband Amir crossed the finish line together after Aseel found Amir about to give up on the side of the road.  Back home, life is tough for the newlyweds: Aseel has a Jerusalem ID which means she can visit the West Bank but needs to live in Jerusalem otherwise she’ll lose her residency. But Amir’s West Bank ID means he does not have access to Jerusalem. The forced separation placed a strain on their fledgling marriage, so to be together, they\u0027ve chosen to live in Kufr Aqab. This small area of Jerusalem lies just outside the wall, and is home to 140,000 Palestinians living in cramped, substandard conditions – there\u0027s no waste removal and running water is available just twice a week. Many of the residents have mixed IDs like Aseel and Amir, and have chosen to live there as there is no other way for them to be together. It\u0027s a story that is all too common for Palestinians. ‘It’s not easy living like this daily,’ says Marwa Edkaidek, 28, part of the Jerusalem Running Community. ‘Every little step you need the proof that you are the son of this land, you need a permit to cross to the near city that’s only 30 minutes away from where you live. Palestinians want to live a peaceful life – when you see us protesting or throwing rocks on the news, it’s because we’ve reached breaking point.’ This isn’t the first project that Aseel and Diala have taken part in to raise awareness of the lack of freedom of movement in Palestine. In 2016, they ran in relay teams between Bethlehem and Nazavrus as part of Right to Movement’s #MaryCantMove campaign, aiming to highlight that Mary and Joseph wouldn’t have been able to make their famous journey today. Checkpoints aren\u0027t the only problem for the young women taking part in the marathon – there’s also a backlash from men in their community. A former UN marathon through the Gaza Strip was cancelled as Palestinian militant Islamist group Hamas wouldn’t not allow men and women to run together, and when Aseel started running back in 2014, she was one of just six female runners in the Ramallah community.  ‘My parents thought I was mad, and asked what I could possibly get out of running apart from nasty looks from people on the streets,’ she says. ‘But I get my freedom. We’ve had guys chasing us in cars, stalking us, and giving us disgusting comments. Even the reactions from the women can be negative – I remember once a young women saw us running and sarcastically commented, “Look at these girls they think they are in New York.” But we don’t care, we just carry on focusing on our breathing and our speed.\u0027 Slowly, attitudes to running are changing, particularly since the marathon was introduced five years ago. The film makers hope that the documentary will help to change perceptions, as well as raising awareness but the lack of freedom of movement faced by Palestinians on a daily basis. Film maker Cairsti has been left with more of a sense of what the runners have in common than that which differs between them.

The Openreach cabinet was originally green in colour when it was erected on a street in the 650-year-old village of Stanstead, Suffolk. But after locals complained that it looked so out of place, the company camouflaged the box to match the flint wall behind it. And the results are remarkable. At a quick glance, the 4ft tall, 4ft wide box is barely visible, with the printed material covering it an almost exact match with the wall.  Wall owner, Ervin Xhafa, who had contacted BT about the box in front of his 16th century home, said it now blends in much better. The 35-year-old property executive told The Sun :It is certainly an improvement and blends in much better with the street scene. But we would still rather that it was not there. BT teamed up with council officials to disguise the box. Graham Lee, acting chairman of the parish council, described seeing workers meticulously covering the box in the wall-themed material.  The result is remarkable - and full marks to BT and Openreach for going the extra mile to help what could be deemed as an unsightly metal box blend in to our village, he said. Another local praised the terrific work. But they claimed that while the stealthy cabinet looks great, they are still yet to be connected to faster broadband. Earlier this month, it emerged that BT is to replace its chief executive, Gavin Patterson, amid waning support for the company\u0027s trajectory.

Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in hospital on April 12 2015 after taking eight tablets containing the poisonous Dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo, 31, from Gosport in Hampshire, was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of two counts of manslaughter and one of placing unsafe food on the market. He will be sentenced on Friday. Rebelo admitted while giving evidence during the trial that he sold DNP to Miss Parry.  He told the jury that he included a warning on his website that the substance was not for human consumption. Rebelo\u0027s girlfriend Mary Roberts, 32, was cleared by the jury of one count of money laundering after she was accused of transferring \u0026pound20,000 for and on behalf of Rebelo. Ms Roberts said she had never seen capsules for making pills where she lived and if she had she would have asked her partner Rebelo why they were there. She also said she had taken little interest in asking details of a business Rebelo had set up to sell muscle enhancing supplements and protein shakes. The couple wept in the dock as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with Rebelo asking the judge: Can I see my daughter? Ms Roberts could be heard crying as the couple hugged one another. The jury had begun its deliberations on Tuesday afternoon.  Miss Parry died after taking eight diet pills containing the highly toxic DNP. Her sister Rebecca Parry, now aged 19, said in a statement read out during the trial that she had been focused on losing weight. She noted that in the weeks and months leading up to her death, her sister had struggled more and more with her eating disorder. She said: The diet pills she had taken had made her lose a drastic amount of weight but she still wanted to be slimmer. Rebecca Parry said she left Eloise\u0027s house on April 11 at about 9pm and that her sister, who had been talking about doing a Master\u0027s degree, seemed happy but tired. She had leg pain.

Alan Graystone, 60, died after pouring petrol over himself and setting himself ablaze just two days after Christmas, the hearing was told. He was discovered on fire by his shocked former partner who had noticed an orange glow outside her Hull home, Hull Live reports. Today, the woman told the inquest into Mr Graystone\u0027s death how the dad-of-four was not shouting or anything when she found him. She said she began screaming, What have you done?, before her ex-partner, who was facing her, fell to his knees and said I love you.  After finding Mr Graystone on fire on the night of December 27, the woman said she and her daughter tried to put out the flames. They used a pot of water and a water-soaked blanket, but the pub landlord was already black all over, the hearing was told. He sadly died at the scene, according to the news site. The coroner today concluded that Mr Graystone’s death was suicide, saying his actions were both premeditated and preplanned. The inquest, held at Hull Coroner\u0027s Court, heard he had left notes before he was discovered in flames shortly after 8pm. In a statement, heard at the court, Mr Graystone\u0027s ex-partner said the couple had been together for a while before splitting up in 2016.  She said they had lived together until 2017 due to the tenancy on the pub, the Blacksmith Arms, they ran together in Witham. Later that year, on December 27, she said an envelope was pushed through her door before she saw an orange glow outside. She then went to the door, moments after Mr Graystone had poured petrol over his body and set himself alight, the inquest heard. “Me and my daughter were in the house and I was preparing vegetables, the woman told the hearing. “My daughter said there was a letter from Alan with USB stick. He said it was all the photos of us. Another envelope was posted but I didn’t read it and heard him at the door.  “I then saw an orange glow through the frosted glass of the front door. I opened the door and Alan was facing me. He was on fire and covered in flames. “He was not shouting or anything. I started screaming and said ‘what have you done? What have you done? “He fell to his knees and I heard him say ‘I love you’.” Mr Graystone’s ex-partner’s daughter also recounted what happened that night, describing how the landlord tried to push himself up. She said: “I saw an orange glow and thought Alan had set the house on fire. Me and my mum opened the door at the same time. I looked to the left and saw Alan covered in flames from his head to his shins. I screamed ‘what have you done?’. “I heard him say ‘I love you’ and he fell to his hands and knees and then on to his stomach. He tried to push himself up and then he held his arms outstretched. “I went to get a bed sheet and wet it before throwing it over him. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion and I couldn’t seem to move my arms and legs quickly enough.”  She said she has still not come to terms with what happened. She said in a statement: “I have never been back to that address and I never will. What I saw that night will remain with me forever.” Mr Graystone\u0027s death came days after he had been arrested over an attack on his ex-partner\u0027s new boyfriend, the hearing heard. “In December my new partner was involved in an incident where bleach was thrown in his face, his former partner said. He had to have an operation and will need further operations. Alan was arrested and bailed, his ex-partner said. “Shortly before he died I saw him parked up at my place of work and he was crying. He said it was not him who did it but hoped I would get fed up of my partner and come back to home. “He said this would be the last time I see him and he would not bother me anymore.” Mr Graystone\u0027s brother, Kevin, had previously told the inquest how Alan had been in a series of failed relationships which made him depressed.

Officers were called to Imperial Road just after 1pm on Monday and taped off a section of the residential street. They carried out an extensive search and later revealed they had recovered a suspected stolen car.  A man was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. He was later released pending further enquiries. Photos showed a car taped off and police vans and officers at the scene.

Miss Bumbum World will elect the best booty on the planet at a star-studded event in Miami in March next year, it was announced today. The competition\u0027s organisers said they decided to launch the global competition after receiving requests from women around the world asking to take part in the famous contest, which is now in its eight year in Brazil. Miss Bumbum World will carry the same rules as the Brazilian competition, which prohibits participants who have undergone surgery to enlarge or enhance their bums.  Registrations for contestants will open on December 1. But unlike the Brazil contest, which bans bottoms bigger than 107cm (42in) in diameter, there will be no limit on the size of contestants\u0027 bottoms, meaning Kim Kardashian\u0027s 109cm (43in) wide bottom could take part. For the global competition, one contestant will be chosen for each country, with no limit on the number of nations represented. During the live final in Miami next year, each participant will be marked by a panel of judges after shaking their bottoms in a free performance wearing an outfit inspired by their national dress, organisers said.  Announcing Miss Bumbum World, the competition’s creator Cacau Oliver yesterday released some of the hundreds of photos sent to him by would-be Miss Bumbums around the world. And he criticised the recent decision by Miss America to ban the swimwear portion from its pageant, saying that traditional beauty contests had become outdated. He said: Every year we receive emails and messages from women from all around the world. We have run some competitions outside of Brazil, and this year both Japan and Poland will have versions of the contest. Because of the number of women expressing their interest in taking part we decided to create Miss Bumbum World, which is a global version of the Brazilian competition. I think we’ll get thousands of entrants.  Anyone can take part, but we would prefer that each nation elects their own representative who will fight to prove that their country has the best bottom in the world. Cacau, the star of a new reality show in Brazil following his work promoting the Miss Bumbum brand, added: As people lose interest in other beauty pageants because they just show stereotypes, Miss Bumbum continues fascinate people around the world. Banning bikinis from their catwalks shows just how outdated Miss America and other beauty contests have become.

Janet Alexander, 46, claims her daughter Rose was taken by a stranger during a family holiday to the country in April. The senior charge nurse from Inverness says her youngest daughter was taken while at a supervised kids club at the Royal Wings Hotel in Antalya. After taking her eldest daughter Lois, nine, to a scuba lesson, Janet returned an hour later to discover Rose was missing. A frantic search for the child was then launched and Janet has described seeing staff turn to a woman in a hijab and speak to her in Turkish.  It is believed the ordeal came to an end 40 minutes later when another hotel guest spotted the blonde youngster walking with a woman in a hijab near a main road within the hotel grounds. Janet claims that hotel staff did not even know the girl was gone and when the staff failed to answer any questions Janet took her two daughters to the local police station. After speaking with an on-duty interpreter, Janet says police said they could not look into the matter as Rose was not physically harmed and had been returned safely. The P1 pupil was invited to go for a walk and thought it was okay as she remembered going for outside walks at pre-school.  The mother of two has now opened up about the experience - which she said is the most traumatic of my life. Janet said: I was completely distraught, completely. There was chaos as everybody realised she was missing and started running around and people from around the pool started looking for her. I was really quite frozen with fear. This has been the most traumatic experience of my life. I thought my daughter was either dead or faced being trafficked and abused. People need to realise these staff-led play groups aren\u0027t the safe places we believe them to be. I\u0027ll never trust Thomas Cook again.  Janet is now suing Thomas Cook over the alleged incident. The holiday in April this year was the first ever trip abroad for Janet and her daughters. The family was three days into a week-long break when the incident happened. Janet, a nurse with NHS Highland, remains shaken by the incident and hasn\u0027t been able to return to work due to suffering from extreme anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Janet has voiced her anger at Thomas Cook who she claims have not apologised for what went on.  She said: No matter how much I process things it just leaves me in pieces. I\u0027ve been shaking and in tears ever since it happened - I even struggle to leave the kids at school now. My work, neighbours, family and friends have all been really supportive. Even though they couldn\u0027t do anything, the Turkish police were kind and sympathetic. But Thomas Cook have been a disgrace - they haven\u0027t apologised and have actually gone to great lengths to ignore me. What happened has changed our whole way of living and without even apology it\u0027s like I can\u0027t get closure and don\u0027t know how to heal. Janet has now launched a civil claim stating Thomas Cook failed to respond to repeated calls for help during and after the incident. She hopes the outcome will lead to improved safety standards.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027s christening .  The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will take the service, which will be held at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. The date to pop in your diary is July 9 - but that day is already a very important one for the Queen.  Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen. Her majesty is due to attended to attend Louis\u0027s christening, and it\u0027s expected that Prince Philip will be by her side despite retiring from royal duties last year.

Unlike other members of the royal family, they stayed clear of traditional regal names and picked something a bit more unusual. According to the couple\u0027s spokesman, they picked the name simply because it is just a name they liked. But there is actually a lovely meaning behind the name, which is pronounced Lay-na.  Lena is the Greek word for \u0027light\u0027. So far this year it has been the 279th most popular girl name, 15 places up from last year. However it\u0027s far from a modern name, and it was extremely popular centuries ago.  In terms of popularity, it reached its peak in 1885, when about 6,584 of every million babies were given the name, reports parenting website BabyCentre .   She also shares the name with lots of celebs, including Game of Thrones star Lena Headey and American actress Lena Dunham.  The baby girl\u0027s middle name is Elizabeth, which is likely a tribute to her great-grandmother the Queen.  She shares the middle name with her cousin Prince Charlotte. The new arrival, the second royal baby this year after Prince Louis, is the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s seventh great-grandchild. Little Lena made history by becoming the heaviest ever royal baby, weighing 9lbs and 3oz. She will be a little sister for the couple\u0027s first daughter Mia.  Zara and Mike waited several days to reveal the name, which experts believe is because they needed to tell the Queen the name before they told anyone else. Lena was born at Stroud Maternity Unit in Gloucestershire on Monday, June 18. The royal family released a statement to reveal the news, which read: Mrs Michael Tindall was safely delivered of a baby girl on 18th June, at Stroud Maternity Unit.

For the third consecutive day the mercury hit record-breaking temperatures, with 31.9C recorded in Wales today as the fierce heatwave gripping the UK continues. Forecasters are predicting the record could be broken again within the next 24 hours as temperatures continue soaring, bringing the threat of wildfire, travel chaos and health risks. Porthmadog in north-west Wales today beat the 30.7C (87.3F) recorded in Rostherne in Cheshire yesterday. A spokesman for the Met Office said: The temperature seen at Porthmadog will not necessarily be the highest today but it is the record so far this year.  He continued: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend. We may see some thunderstorms on Sunday or Monday but nothing\u0027s certain. But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday. The sweltering heat hasn\u0027t come without its pitfalls - especially for commuters bracing themselves for yet more chaos as bridges swell and fears rail tracks are buckling under the strain. Gritters and emergency \u0027action teams\u0027 have also hit vital roads and motorways to stop tar melting. Wakefield Council tweeted: If you see our gritters out this afternoon - wave hello! They\u0027re dusting the roads to protect them in the heatwave. Network Rail\u0027s extreme weather action teams are being activated across the country to monitor vulnerable locations and speed restrictions have been imposed, causing delays to services.    Hot weather can cause the steel on rail lines to expand and in some cases buckle, causing travel disruption, Network Rail said. Slower trains exert lower forces on the track, reducing the likelihood of buckling. South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week. Services on the London Waterloo to New Malden line are being subjected to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday. Last night, firefighters were called to Barton Swing Bridge in Salford after the structure expanded in the searing heat and failed to return to its normal position. Meanwhile, the Met Office\u0027s heat-health watch alert is currently at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  Public Health England (PHE) has issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable, while the RSPCA is calling on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals. PHE said the over-65s, young children and those with health conditions are the most vulnerable in hot weather, and encouraged people to look out for each other. Dr Thomas Waite of PHE said: It\u0027s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk, and chances are we\u0027ll all know someone, if we\u0027re all going to stay well this summer.  The heat has already claimed casualties - a 1 7-year-old boy was recovered from the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search a rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.   Elsewhere, the search continues for 13-year-old Ryan Evans who has been missing since Monday after getting into difficulty in Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent.  The alarm was raised when he was spotted in distress with two other boys at one end of the lake at around 5pm. The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  Those in the Peak District have been warned to stay away from part of Saddleworth Moor, which has been gripped by wildfire since Sunday afternoon with the army on standby while fire crews battle to bring the blaze under control.

In January this year Cara Droy’s “pretty giant ovarian cyst” had grown to nearly a foot long, from her rib to the pit of her stomach, and weighed almost a stone.  The 29-year-old’s life was turned around when the cyst was found and doctors told her to stay away from the gym in case it burst – halting her strongwoman training, reports the Daily Record .  Cara became weak and was unable to train for competitions as the cyst grew unusually quickly.  She said: “It was painful, like carrying a child near the end. I had irregular bleeding in the New Year and I knew something was wrong, so I had to go to the doctors. “On examination, the doctor said my uterus was inflamed and it was acting like I was having a child. When I received my ultrasound scan I was told that it was the size of a large melon and they would have to operate as it was growing.” Cara, form Hamilton in South Lanarkshire, stopped competing over a year ago as she says she was growing tired of the sport as her strength was dwindling, and that was frustrating. She said: “In hindsight, it’s probably the cyst that caused all the tiredness and weakness as the growth took over most of my core, I just didn’t know it at the time.  “I competed in Scotland’s Strongest Woman in three competitions. I also took part in a couple of power lifting competitions too and made it to a British final. “Back in 2013 I was sitting at nearly 17 stone. I didn’t exercise, I didn’t do anything at all and in a year I changed my life. “ I got down to 12-and-a-half stone and I found that I was pretty strong, probably because of the weight I used to carry around all the time. “I found the sport of Strongman and I just loved it. Weightlifting was like therapy through tough times and I made so many friends.” Cara, a former St Elizabeth’s Primary pupil, had the cyst removed in March along with one of her ovaries and fallopian tube but now, just two months later, she has been diagnosed with endometriosis.  She said: “Two months later, I went back to the doctor for what I assumed was a check-up. I’ve now been told there is a fair amount of endometriosis on my one remaining ovary, an incurable illness which affects one in ten women. “It can create other cysts, seriously affect fertility and cause a lot of pain. It causes a lot of worry for me, that I might not be able to have a family, that I knew relatively nothing about this disease even though it affects ten per cent of women. For the past four months I’ve been pretty tired and weak but my partner Fraser has been really supportive.” The company secretary is now keen to educate others about the affects of endometriosis and plans to take part in the Kiltwalk in Edinburgh on September 16 to raise cash for Endometriosis UK, the charity set up to support women with the condition. Cara said: “Myself and my little mini dachshund Hugo have decided to brave the Kiltwalk in Edinburgh.

Cindie Allen-Stewart, from Texas, would slather herself in sunscreen only to find she was still getting burnt. She tried numerous methods to ease the pain and redness with no luck, until finally trying one her mother-in-law suggested - and now she swears by it. The home remedy treatment, which she has been using for the past 10 years and takes just minutes, involves shaving cream and she says \u0027works wonders\u0027.  In a Facebook post which has since gone viral, Cindie wrote: It takes the heat out of it fast and makes it more comfortable on you. First, buy some Menthol foam shaving cream. It has to be the foam and it has to have menthol in it. We found Gillette shaving cream on Amazon since we had problems finding menthol foam in stores. We ended up buying 6 cans of it, but it works out because we live in Texas and sunburns happen a lot. (Plus, we have given a couple cans to friends.) Next, apply the shaving cream on the burn. It may seem like it\u0027s a strange shaving ritual, but trust me! Don\u0027t rub it in, just let it sit on your skin. It will start bringing all that heat out (you\u0027ll be able to feel it). You may feel like you are itchy too, but that\u0027s a good thing! Itching means healing.  Cindie says after 30 minutes, the shaving cream should have dissolved into spots and feel dried out. You will feel as if you\u0027re becoming a little cold, she added. At least on the sunburned part of your body. THAT IS A GOOD SIGN! Next, rinse it off in a lukewarm or cool shower or bath. It\u0027s just to get the residue off. Finally, if you still need it, do it again the next day. Usually after that second treatment, the sunburn disappears. I use this on my kids too!  Cindie\u0027s mother-in-law learned the method from a doctor 40 years ago and thought it was crazy then too until she saw it in action. Stay-at-home mum Cindie has tried aloe vera in the past but finds the shaving cream works a lot better. She added: I\u0027m not saying to go out and do this, I was just showing my friends what I do. Please remember to always use sunscreen! Too much sun exposure can be dangerous and lead to cancer. By no means am I endorsing going out without sunscreen! I burn with sunscreen as well and know of the hassle, but it is worth it to wear it!

That\u0027s what one British mum is asking other parents after discovering that a raunchy couple are getting a kick out of getting it on in her garden. A woman, who goes by the username eurgh, revealed in an online forum that people are having sex in the hedge at the bottom of her garden and she doesn\u0027t know what to do about it.  Every few nights people (I assume the same two) keep having sex in the hedge which divides my back garden from the road behind it, she wrote on MumsNet.   She added: It\u0027s pretty brazen because there\u0027s no real cover to hide under! Every few nights I\u0027ll be sitting with my new rescue dog and letting her potter about and I\u0027ll hear my hedge making groany sex noises. I\u0027m so tempted to cough loudly or say something but for some reason I just keep quiet and feel weird listening to other people\u0027s sex noises. So, I ask you, what would you do? A whole host of mums were quick to share their suggestions on how to deal with the cheeky pair. Many were in favour of turning the garden hose or a water pistol on the couple.  One user said: I\u0027d decide it was time my hedge had a watering and turn the hose on it. Others thought she should get her dog involved in the action. Is your dog trained to fetch? Could you maybe lob a ball or stick or something into the hedge and get your dog to go in after it then see what fun ensues, suggested one mum. Perfect weather to encourage pests in that particular area or encourage your dog to go to the toilet there, added another.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Arbroath-Road-towards-the-Kingsway-junction-stock-image.jpg ","title":"dundee council objects to plan to

Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him. He even used to come in to do the dishes for us.“Everyone knows him from the cash and carry to the bank everyone knows who he is.“We also couldn’t do it without Iona Carlin, one of our staff, she has been with us three years and we are all just like a big family now.”n At Dundee and Angus College there is a range of courses on offer for would-be chefs with SVQ levels two and three in professional cookery available.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/B88-1971-08-00-Children-at-Broughty-Ferry-Beach-CDCT.jpg ","title":"dundee people from the 1920s to now hot summer days in the ferry","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFamilies enjoying a day out on the beach, kids having a splash about in the water, fishing off the harbour\u0026#8230 while somethings have undoubtedly changed over the years, it’s clear many things have remained exactly the same in Broughty Ferry.The suburb has long had a host of attractions and activities for residents and visitors alike.We dive into our archives once more to see what summer days were like in the Ferry.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780eda4be9.jpg ","title":"dundee people karen helps to heal and comfort others","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“My job allows me to help heal and comfort others who are going through grief.”Karen Docherty, 42, has arguably one of the most unusual jobs that we have featured in this column. She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week

refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.633048.jpg ","title":"michelin dundee in call for more female engineers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEmployees from Michelin Dundee marked International Women in Engineering Day by calling for more women to apply for roles in the engineering field and said a wide variety of careers are available.The firm has 15 female engineers employed in Dundee following the completion of apprenticeships at its training centre.Gill Bannister was Michelin Dundee’s first female apprentice in 1986, when she began a four-year apprenticeship as a maintenance fitter.Ms Bannister said: “I left school with no training but I thought engineering sounded interesting so I applied for a Michelin apprenticeship and against 800 other applicants I was successful.“It has worked out really well for me and I’m glad that I have my Michelin training behind me.“We don’t just train our technicians to work for Michelin, the apprenticeship covers a range of maintenance engineering subjects which are very useful in the wider world too.”Her colleague, Sarah King, has just completed an apprenticeship with Michelin.

Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

and friends together for a picnic in Bellfield Park.Chairwoman of the group, Kabie Brook, wanted to thank everyone for coming along.\"Autistic Pride Day was rather special this year because at ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers provided stories about life with

little comfort.\"Let\u0027s not forget what Autistic Pride is and why we need it,\" Mrs Brook added.\"We belong to a marginalised minority and are treated appallingly from childhood but we are human, we are valid, we aren\u0027t ashamed.\"A NEW deal for people with autism in the Highlands \u0026ndash placing them at the heart of discussions about their care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or ideas for improvements.She can be contacted by

access","story":"\u0026nbspA COALITION of disability and mobility organisations has called on Highland Council to make Inverness more accessible.The Putting Inverness Streets Ahead manifesto was launched on Thursday.Attended by charity representatives and local councillors, the call was made to make the Highland capital fit for the 21st century.The manifesto has been produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city centre streets outside of specified collection times.This was in response to complaints about them being both unsightly and obstructive.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 11:35

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

He is trying to raise awareness of the need for these two groups to be brought together.In his words: “It’s not that these people are not out there, they just don’t know who to get in touch with.”His running partner is Leona, who has Usher syndrome.Ben said: “I’d been a runner for 10 years and I was looking to do something to help others but that also fit into my lifestyle.“When I watched the London Marathon in 2017 I saw people guiding and thought it would be a good thing to get into. But when I tried googling information that’s when I realised there is a shortage of it in Scotland, which spurred me on to create the group.“I initially got in touch with North East Sensory Services (NESS), who paired me up with Leona.“She needed a new guide for last year’s Great Aberdeen Run half marathon.“She’s a really strong-willed individual and has done things like climbing Kilimanjaro.“Talking to her she said: ‘This is something we need in the north-east.’”Ben, through the Granite City Guide Running Facebook page and his sessions, is now trying to expose as many people as possible to what guide running entails and how to get started.However, because of Disclosure Scotland legislation designed to protect vulnerable groups, Ben can’t personally introduce prospective guides with sensory-impaired runners.He aims to do this by eventually becoming affiliated with, for example, Grampian Disability Sport.He said: “I’m a point of contact, to find out about guide running and how to get involved.“The long-term aim is to connect people who want to guide with people who need a guide.“At the moment the page is for advice, information and I put on classes (to demonstrate).“I can then put people in touch with NESS or Grampian Disability Sport (who can partner people up).”Ben wants bodies like Scottishathletics and Scottish Disability Sport to make it easier to partner guides and runners, and he’s building evidence to show there is real demand for it. He added: “One thing I am doing is keeping a record of the people who want to guide and the people who need a guide.“So I can go to Scottish Disability Sport and say: ‘you’ve got X amount of people in the north-east alone who want and need this’.“The Facebook page has 170 people who’ve shown an interest.“I’ve had close to 50 people contact me directly saying they want to be guide runners.“There’s been at least a dozen or so (sensory impaired) people who have said this is something they’d look for.”Ben’s next challenge is to get as many people as possible to join him and Leona in taking part in the Great Aberdeen Run. He’s even encouraging non-sensory-impaired pairs to try using a blindfold to understand the challenges a sensory impairment creates.For more information, visit Granite City Guide Running on Facebook.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12804773.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_220618vanessa_03JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds pay tribute celebration vanessa","story":"NewsHundreds pay tribute at celebration of Vanessa Riddle\u0027s lifeAnd one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsVanessa Riddle\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds came to say goodbye on a day to celebrate a remarkable life. And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-car-thief-locked-up-for-60-days","story":"A CAR thief from Galashiels has been jailed for 60 days at Selkirk Sheriff Court.\nTwenty six year old Gary Stewart was spotted driving a Vauxhall Corsa just an hour after it had been reported stolen.\nHe pleaded guilty to the theft and also driving with no insurance or valid licence.\nThe offences happened in the Stanley Street and Gala Park areas of Galashiels on January 13.\nSheriff Euan Edmont told Stewart of Gala Park Court the prison sentence was being reduced from 90 days to 60 days to reflect the guilty plea and back-dated to June 4 when he was first remanded in custody in connection with the matter.\nIn addition he had his licence endorsed with six penalty points for the insurance offence.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"common-riding-druid-visit-leads-to-weekend-behind-bars","story":"A DRUNK smashed the windows of his partner\u0027s home after seeing a man dressed as a druid enter her home.\nAlan Mercer had popped into neighbour Andrea Plumb\u0027s house in Selkirk on Friday night to show off his religious cult costume for a fancy dress competition.\nBut Ms Plumb\u0027s 29-year-old partner Daniel Hamilton from Buccleuch Road in Selkirk did not see the funny side and was arrested for offences of vandalism and breach of the peace.\nHe appeared from custody at Selkirk Sheriff Court after being held over the course of the weekend and pleaded guilty to both charges.\nProcuator fiscal Graham Fraser said: \"The accused has a long list of previous convictions mainly for dishonesty fuelled by drink or drugs but this is more down to passion.\n\"The relationship is rocky due to the accused\u0027s alcohol problems.\"\nHe described how Mr Mercer popped into her house around 4pm wearing a druid outfit for the fancy dress competition but it caused Hamilton to become \"highly agitated\".\nMr Fraser said that Hamilton left the house but returned to start throwing stones through the window of the flat.\nDefence lawyer Ross Dow insisted that the victim wanted Hamilton back despite the incident.\nHe explained: \"It was the Selkirk Common Riding and he fell off the wagon.\"\nSentence was deferred for six months for good behaviour with Sheriff Euan Edmont telling Hamilton:\"Get the windows fixed\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrosians-rideout-lets-do-it-all-over-again","story":"MELROSE Festival\u0027s alternative rideout route was so popular officials may bring it back again.\nDue to uncertainty over the opening of Lowood Bridge, which has been closed over the past 20 weeks for repairs and renovation, Festival officials introduced a new route to the south of the town.\nAnd going by the enthusiastic reaction from the 187 followers of Melrosian Harry Fletcher, consideration will be given to using the new route in the future.\nMelrose Festival chairman Douglas Hardie told us: \"A lot of riders came back saying how much they enjoyed the new route and how they would like to do it all over again.\n\"We are fortunate in the sense that Melrose\u0027s boundaries stretch far and wide and we aren\u0027t limited -

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716318644,16318418,16317765,16317580,16317292\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"claim-that-ai-is-on-par-with-top-doctors-questioned-by-leading-gps","story":"Leading doctors have questioned claims that artificial intelligence can provide heath advice which is \u0026ldquoon-par with top-rated medics.\nTechnology healthcare company Babylon is to present data claiming its artificial intelligence (AI) software achieves equivalent accuracy to human doctors when it comes to giving health advice.\nBut the Royal College of GPs has said \u0026ldquono app or algorithm will be able to do what a GP does.\nBabylon is to present evidence at an event at the Royal College of Physicians headquarters in London which it says demonstrates how its AI can provide health information, rather than a medical diagnosis, in a number of situations.\nBabylon\u0026rsquos AI took the final test for trainee GPs, set by the \n@RCPG\n, passing with 81% \n#BabylonAITest\npic.twitter/BDF5BpmZQQ\n\u0026mdash Babylon (@babylonhealth) \nJune 27, 2018\nIt said its software can pass relevant sections of the final test for trainee GPs \u0026ndash known as the MRCGP \u0026ndash set by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP).\nIn test simulations \u0026ndash the RCGP does not publish past papers so Babylon used example questions \u0026ndash Babylon\u0026rsquos AI scored 81%.\nBabylon said the average pass mark for real life doctors was 72%.\nBut the College said the claim was \u0026ldquodubious.\nTo further test the software, the AI was presented with case studies where it was told about a series of symptoms, and its responses were compared to those of seven \u0026ldquohighly-experienced primary care doctors.\nIn the 100 cases, Babylon\u0026rsquos AI scored 80% for accuracy, while the seven doctors achieved an accuracy range of 64-94%, it said.\nBut it stressed that its AI remains an information service, rather than a medical diagnosis.\nDr Ali Parsa on the importance of AI-technology to Babylon\u0026rsquos mission statement \n#BabylonAITest\npic.twitter/DmLeIBvHOX\n\u0026mdash Babylon (@babylonhealth) \nJune 27, 2018\nDr Ali Parsa, Babylon\u0026rsquos founder and chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoEven in the richest nations, primary care is becoming increasingly unaffordable and inconvenient, often with waiting times that make it not readily accessible.\n\u0026ldquoBabylon\u0026rsquos latest artificial intelligence capabilities show that it is possible for anyone, irrespective of their geography, wealth or circumstances, to have free access to health advice that is on-par with top-rated practising clinicians.\nBut Professor Martin Marshall, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u0026ldquoThe potential of technology to support doctors to deliver the best possible patient care is fantastic, but at the end of the day computers are computers, and GPs are highly-trained medical professionals \u0026ndash the two can\u0026rsquot be compared and the former may support but will never replace the latter.\n\u0026ldquoNo app or algorithm will be able to do what a GP does.\n\u0026ldquoMuch of what GPs do is based on a trusting relationship between a patient and a doctor, and research has shown GPs have a \u0026lsquogut feeling\u0026rsquo when they just know something is wrong with a patient.\n\u0026ldquoAn app might be able to pass an automated clinical knowledge test but the answer to a clinical scenario isn\u0026rsquot always cut and dried, there are many factors to take into account, a great deal of risk to manage, and the emotional impact a diagnosis might have on a patient to consider.\n\u0026ldquoIt is also the case that the exam-preparation materials, used by Babylon in this research, will have been compiled for revision purposes and are not necessarily representative of the full-range of questions and standard used in the actual MRCGP exam, so to say that Babylon\u0026rsquos algorithm has performed better than the average MRCGP candidate is dubious.\nProf Marshall added: \u0026ldquoBabylon\u0026rsquos GP at Hand service uses technology in a way that some patients like. But some don\u0026rsquot, and the way it is being used risks undermining and damaging traditional general practice services.\n\u0026ldquoThe College has publicly criticised GP at Hand for \u0026lsquocherry-picking\u0026rsquo patients, leaving traditional GP services to deal with the most complex patients, without sufficient resources to do so.\n\u0026ldquoWe stand by this: we do not endorse Babylon, or its GP at Hand service, being used in the way that it is, in the NHS.\n\u0026ldquoTechnology has the potential to transform the NHS, but it must be implemented in an equitable way, that doesn\u0026rsquot benefit some patients, and not others, and is not to the detriment of the general practice service as a whole.\nDr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAI may have a place in the tools doctors use to support and treat patients, but it cannot replace the essential elements of the doctor-patient relationship which is at the heart of medicine.\n\u0026ldquoThis study vastly underestimates the reason why a patient visits their GP and what they expect from a consultation. For elderly patients or those with a number of complex conditions, diagnosis tools such as these will be completely unsuitable.\n\u0026ldquoMedicine is far more than diagnosis, and is certainly more than an algorithm.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Ella Pickover, Press Association Health Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u002745902d07-52ab-43ad-8cc7-84d053c9550d\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk,paservice:sci-tech,paservice:sci-tech:science\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Claim that AI is \\u2018on-par\\u2019 with top doctors questioned by leading GPs\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"letter general waste in recycling bins","story":"I was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoke to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful.I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done and I asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Councillor Alastair Redman,Islay.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mating dragonflies were damselflies","story":"I read the article on Shopper-Aide\u0026#8217s sponsored walk from High Lossit to Killypole with great interest, for I have often walked that way and I like the area.However I would point out a couple of mistakes in the accompanying pictures.The one entitled \u0026#8216Viper\u0026#8217s Bugloss\u0026#8217 is in fact a different plant named bugle, Ajuga reptans.Viper\u0026#8217s bugloss has not been recorded in Kintyre.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.

Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.

The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"calls-to-tackle-edinburgh-bypass-gridlock-as-tram-system-to-musselburgh-mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.  I thought \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not having this\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos ridiculous.  \u0026ldquoIt was Keith\u0026rsquos birthday recently and we had a barbecue. They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

But Professor Martin Marshall, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u0026ldquoThe potential of technology to support doctors to deliver the best possible patient care is fantastic, but at the end of the day computers are computers, and GPs are highly-trained medical professionals \u0026ndash the two can\u0026rsquot be compared and the former may support but will never replace the latter.  \u0026ldquoNo app or algorithm will be able to do what a GP does.  \u0026ldquoMuch of what GPs do is based on a trusting relationship between a patient and a doctor, and research has shown GPs have a \u0026lsquogut feeling\u0026rsquo when they just know something is wrong with a patient.  \u0026ldquoAn app might be able to pass an automated clinical knowledge test but the answer to a clinical scenario isn\u0026rsquot always cut and dried, there are many factors to take into account, a great deal of risk to manage, and the emotional impact a diagnosis might have on a patient to consider.  \u0026ldquoIt is also the case that the exam-preparation materials, used by Babylon in this research, will have been compiled for revision purposes and are not necessarily representative of the full-range of questions and standard used in the actual MRCGP exam, so to say that Babylon\u0026rsquos algorithm has performed better than the average MRCGP candidate is dubious.  Prof Marshall added: \u0026ldquoBabylon\u0026rsquos GP at Hand service uses technology in a way that some patients like. But some don\u0026rsquot, and the way it is being used risks undermining and damaging traditional general practice services.  \u0026ldquoThe College has publicly criticised GP at Hand for \u0026lsquocherry-picking\u0026rsquo patients, leaving traditional GP services to deal with the most complex patients, without sufficient resources to do so.  \u0026ldquoWe stand by this: we do not endorse Babylon, or its GP at Hand service, being used in the way that it is, in the NHS.  \u0026ldquoTechnology has the potential to transform the NHS, but it must be implemented in an equitable way, that doesn\u0026rsquot benefit some patients, and not others, and is not to the detriment of the general practice service as a whole.  Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAI may have a place in the tools doctors use to support and treat patients, but it cannot replace the essential elements of the doctor-patient relationship which is at the heart of medicine.  \u0026ldquoThis study vastly underestimates the reason why a patient visits their GP and what they expect from a consultation. For elderly patients or those with a number of complex conditions, diagnosis tools such as these will be completely unsuitable.  \u0026ldquoMedicine is far more than diagnosis, and is certainly more than an algorithm."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7980947.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"hilarious-moment-katy-perry-gives-shocked-teens-free-gig-tickets-in-glasgow","story":"              THIS is the hilarious moment US singer Katy Perry gave out tickets to her Glasgow gig to shocked young teens along the River Clyde.

Mr Brown, who earlier this month became deputy leader of the SNP, had been seen as one of the poorer performers in cabinet, with economic growth\u0026nbsppersistently lagging behind UK rates.\u0026nbsp  The party claimed his exit, and the loss of his \u0026pound42,000 salary bump, would bring\u0026nbsphim an \"enhanced depute leader role\".  However Mr Brown previously claimed he could be both depute leader and a cabinet secretary, and the move will be seen as a demotion.  The First Minister, who returned to Scotland from a trade mission in Berlin this morning, will announce her full ministerial team this afternoon.  The normal early Tuesday meeting of the Scottish cabinet has been cancelled.  The beleaguered Health Secretary Shona Robison is seen as the most likely change at the top, however she may be moved sideways rather than sacked.  Social security minister Jeanne Freeman, Brexit minister Michael Russell and Transport minister Humza Yousaf have been tipped for elevation to cabinet level.  Among the new intake of 2016, Kate Forbes, Ivan McKee and Gail Ross are regarded as likely to become ministers for the first time.  The changes are expected to maintain the gender balance of Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos last cabinet.  Ms Sturgeon, who became First Minister in November 2014, has made only minor changes to her ministerial team since entering Bute House.  However a series of problems in health, including missed waiting time targets and financial issues at NHS Tayside, have been adding to pressure for a refresh before the 2021 election.  Despite failing to deliver a long-awaited Education Bill, deputy First Minister John Swinney is seen as safe."},{"url":null,"title":"more-heads-roll-in-sweeping-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              THREE cabinet secretaries and three ministers are to leave the Scottish Government\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsweeping reshuffle.  Health Secretary Shona Robison, Communities Secretary Angela Constance, and Economy Secretary Keith Brown are all out, the Scottish Government confirmed.  Ms Robison and Ms Constance - who had been tipped for the chop - wrote to Nicola Sturgeon to confirm their resignations.\u0026nbsp  The First Minister paid tribute to their work. She is due to announce her new Cabinet later.  Also sacked are International Development minister Dr Alasdair Allan, Community Safety minister Annabelle Ewing, and mental health minister Maureen Watt.  The end of Ms Robison\u0026rsquos tenure as health secretary had been widely predicted given grim waiting time statistics and scandals at her local health board, NHS Tayside.  Her departure coincided with the BMA in Scotland claiming the NHS was being \u0026ldquopushed to the brink, \u0026nbspthe worst waiting times for cancer treatment in six years, and an investigation confirming a culture of \u0026ldquobullying and harassment at NHS Lothian - a not untypical day.  In her resignation letter to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Robison said her three and a half years in the post had been an immense privilege \u0026ldquoalbeit at times very challenging and all consuming.  She said her last year had been \u0026ldquoparticularly challenging on a personal level, as she had lost both parents, had a health scare of her own, and seen other \u0026ldquobig changes in her life.  \u0026ldquoI thank you for your support during these difficult times, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI feel that I have reached a point in my life just now where I would be best to step down from a role in Government. I have entered a new chapter in my life, including a new relationship, where it would be good to take time to focus on those closest to me, who have too often had to come second place to my job, which has hard for us all.  In reply, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Robison had \u0026ldquoserved with distinction over her 11 years in government, and said her time as health secretary had ended with high levels of patient satisfaction and the lowest A\u0026ampE waiting times in the UK for three years.  She also said the integration of health and social care was to her \u0026ldquoimmense credit.  She wrote: \u0026ldquoI know that recent years have brought a number of personal challenges for you, including the loss of both your parents and health worries of your own, among other issues.  \u0026ldquoDespite this, you continued to serve the people of Scotland with dedication, just as you did your loved ones. I am delighted to wish you every happiness in your new relationship.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos correspondence with Ms Constance lacked any such warmth, and Ms Constance offered no reason for leaving, strongly suggesting she was sacked.  The Almond Valley MSP said it had been an honour to serve in government for eight years, and said she had been particularly proud of her work on affordable homes, social security, gender recognition on public boards, gypsy travellers and child poverty.  \u0026ldquoI have been very lucky throughout my political life to have had the support of my family and there is no doubt that without them I couldn\u0026rsquot have undertaken the many roles I have had the privilege of occupying, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to spending more times with them and my growing son.  In rely, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Constance had worked \u0026ldquotirelessly to give a voice at the Cabinet table to those who are not always heard in society.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe fact Scotland has received international recognition for the work we have done to support refugees, on LGBTI+ rights, on women\u0026rsquos right and many other areas is in no small part down to your leadership.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required. If the change in the ministerial team is not matched by a change of policy then our NHS will continue to decline."},{"url":null,"title":"ex-manager-jim-chapman-sues-clyde-fc-for-30k-over-breach-of-contract","story":"              The former manager of Clyde FC is suing the cash-strapped club for almost \u0026pound30,000 for breach of contract.  Jim Chapman was just five months into his two-year contract with the Cumbernauld side when he left the club in October last year after a run of poor results.  His departure came just days after heated exchanges between the management team and fans during a home defeat to Elgin City.  Mr Chapman has now launched an employment tribunal against the fan-owned team, which operates as a Community Interest Club.  He is seeking a payout of \u0026pound27,390 for breach of contract, as well as more than \u0026pound800 for unpaid holiday pay.  The tribunal initially awarded in favour of the ex-manager as the club failed to lodge a response on time, but that decision has now been overturned at Clyde\u0026rsquos request and a full hearing is scheduled take place at a later date.  Read more:\u0026nbspClyde FC\u0027s handling of race row footballer condemned in Scottish Parliament  In a written decision on the case, employment judge Robert Gall stated: \u0026ldquoThe claimant was on a fixed two-year contract with the respondents.  \u0026ldquoHis claim is for breach of contract on the basis that he maintains he ought to have been employed for a two-year period and is therefore entitled to the full amount of his salary for the remainder of his contract.  Mr Chapman, who was a forward for Albion Rovers and Dumbarton during his playing career, has also lodged a claim for unlawful deduction of wages.  The judgment, which ruled that Clyde should now be allowed to defend the action, also detailed how the club lied about seeking legal advice.  Club chairman Norrie Innes told Mr Chapman\u0026rsquos lawyer that he had been advised that the club were on \u0026ldquostrong ground, when he had not even contacted a solicitor.  Mr Innes also emailed the tribunal to say that the claim would be \u0026ldquorobustly defended and again referred to having legal representation when he did not.  The club had not contacted a lawyer \u0026ldquobecause of the difficult financial position they were in, wishing to restrict their costs.  Read more:\u0026nbspClyde escape serious punishment over \"inadvertently\" failing to pay a tax bill on time  When Mr Innes was asked about lying, he told the tribunal that he had been \u0026ldquoboxing clever.

The judge added: \u0026ldquoI did not see the actions of Mr Inness in the period after the claim had been lodged as \u0026lsquoboxing clever\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt would have course been better had the respondents actually taken legal advice.  \u0026ldquoHad he taken legal advice he might have been better prepared for the tribunal claim being served upon the respondents and perhaps then to have taken steps to defend the claim within the appropriate time period.  At the time of Mr Chapman\u0026rsquos departure, assistant manager John Joyce also left the club.  Speaking as their departures were announced, Mr Innes said: \u0026ldquoWe as a board have worked very hard on the commercial and football operational side of the club.  \u0026ldquoOn both, we have made significant progress and we are building positive, long-term relationships and core facilities that will continue regardless of who is in position.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it is clear that the overall performance, league results and position are not aligned with our expectations.

Health Secretary Shona Robison, Communities Secretary Angela Constance and Economy Secretary Keith Brown are leaving the government, as are three junior ministers.  The cabinet is expanded from 10 to 12 places.  The respected social security minister Jeane Freeman becomes the new health Secretary, transport minister Humza Yousaf becomes justice secretary, universities minister Shirley Anne-Somerville is social security secretary, public health minister Aileen Campbell becomes communities secretary, and Brexit minister Michael Russell is elevated to cabinet rank as secretary for government business and constitutional relations.

A gaggle of journalists and photographers spent the afternoon huddled around the railings of the Georgian townhouse, glued to their phones for the latest updates.  Every time a swanky car drove past, notepads would rustle and microphones hastily assemble. There were a number of false alarms.  But as a string of SNP figures were dropped off and quickly let inside, a picture emerged of dramatic change within the corridors of Bute House.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon \u0026ndash widely known as a cautious politician \u0026ndash was presiding over one of the biggest reshuffles in the history of devolution.  Standing on the steps of Bute House just after 5.30pm, she spoke of bringing \u0026ldquofresh talent to the table and referenced the looming challenges of Brexit and delivering Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system.  There were casualties, of course. But around her, five new faces beamed.  Former transport minister Humza Yousaf was promoted to Justice Secretary \u0026ndash a position previously held by Michael Matheson, who will become Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.  First given a ministerial role under Alex Salmond, Mr Yousaf is among Holyrood\u0026rsquos most high-profile figures.  As transport minister, he faced down calls to quit over ScotRail\u0026rsquos performance, and survived a blizzard of criticism over winter storms and \u0026ldquosnagging issues with the \u0026pound1.35bn Queensferry Crossing.  Another big name given a boost was former Brexit minister Michael Russell. Previously Education Secretary between 2009 and 2014, Mr Russell has burst back into the political limelight in his role representing Scotland in the Brexit negotiations.  He will become Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations \u0026ndash a newly created role focused on protecting Scotland\u0026rsquos interests as the UK leaves the EU.  Another new position reflecting the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos shifting priorities was given to Shirley-Anne Somerville.  The MSP, who has been minister for further education since May 2016, will become the Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People.  This will give her responsibility for overseeing Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system following the devolution of 11 benefits, worth around \u0026pound3.3bn a year.  Elsewhere, Jeane Freeman will replace embattled Health Secretary Shona Robison.  Elected in 2016, Ms Freeman is a former Labour special adviser who converted to the independence cause and previously co-founded the campaign group Women for Independence.  She is well respected among backbenchers, but came under fire last year over her alleged role in \u0026ldquosmearing a nurse who challenged Ms Sturgeon during a TV debate. False claims the NHS worker was the wife of a Tory councillor were traced back to Ms Freeman and SNP MP Joanna Cherry.  Finally, Aileen Campbell will take on the role of Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, tasked with reforming councils and tackling poverty.  Previously public health minister, Ms Campbell has led calls for the creation of \u0026ldquosafer injection centres, allowing heroin addicts to take the drug in specialist clinics aimed at preventing deaths.  At the end of a tense day, only three positions remained unchanged. Education Secretary John Swinney, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham and Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop will all remain in their current posts.  Meanwhile, on the lower rungs, Joe FitzPatrick was announced as the new public health minister last night, having previously served as business minister.  Jamie Hepburn was given the expanded role of minister for business, fair work and skills, and Paul Wheelhouse will become minister for energy, connectivity and the islands."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7979783.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-scots-advised-to-take-shorter-showers-as-water-supplies-run-low","story":"              THOUSANDS of Scots have been asked to \"use water wisely\" by taking shorter showers among other measuers\u0026nbspfollowing concerns about reservoir and loch\u0026nbsplevels during a dry June.

The warning means there is an 80% chance of temperatures which could be a risk to health, and is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare.  Rail passengers are being warned of lengthy delays as speed restrictions are enforced to prevent tracks from buckling in a heatwave that has sparked wildfires across parts of Britain - and shows no signs of abating.

The water company said called on customers to \"use water wisely\u0026nbspas a result of prolonged dry weather in the area\".  It said that dry conditions and increased demand in the area meant that \"efficiency measures\" are being requested of customers served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works, Elgin and the Stornoway Water Treatment Works.

John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, spoke out after Ofcom gave their \"very disappointing\" final permission for the BBC to launch its new BBC Scotland service.  The new channel will begin broadcasting on a digital channel in early 2019, and has already begun hiring around 80 staff for the operation.  Newspapers have been concerned the new channel, with expanded digital content, would present increased publicly-funded competition to newspapers and their own news websites.  The BBC also announced it is to set up a new design and engineering hub in Glasgow, investing \u0026pound4m and recruiting an additional 60 people into \"technology and design-led\" roles over the next three years.  In its decision, Ofcom rejects concerns about online competition, and also a concern that newspaper journalists will leave their print employers for the new station.  Mr McLellan said: \"Disappointingly, the ruling is to all intents identical to the indicative decision issued earlier this year.  \"It\u0027s a very disappointing outcome which ignores the legitimate concerns of commercial news providers, and despite months of investigation and consultation amounts to just accepting the BBC\u0027s assurances that its plans do not encroach on private operations.  \"There is not even a commitment to monitor the situation, and surprisingly it seems that Ofcom has even less concern about wider market impact than the old BBC Trust.\"  The Ofcom report says that \"in relation to online news, we found that the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to lead either to a substantial expansion or to a change in the focus of the BBC\u0026rsquos online news offering.  \"We concluded that, in its current form, the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on print and online news provision.\"  It adds that it does not believe that the proposal to create 80 journalism posts, only half of which are news gathering roles, \"poses a significant threat to the ability of Scottish newspapers to attract or retain journalists.\"  The new digital hub will be in Glasgow, and will be similar to existing hubs in London and Salford.  In total it will have more than 100 staff, including existing BBC Design and Engineering staff in Pacific Quay, Glasgow.  The new staff will be working on \"voice platforms\", developing BBC services for Amazon Echo, Google Home and the Apple HomePod.  There will also be jobs in the education wing of the broadcaster, as well as apps, websites and other online material.  Tony Hall, the BBC Director-General said: \"Ofcom giving the green light for the new channel is great news.  \"The new service has huge potential and I\u0026rsquom excited about what it can achieve.\"  Matthew Postgate, the BBC Chief Technology and Product Officer said: \"We know there is a huge amount of technological and creative talent in Scotland.  \"We\u0026rsquore looking forward to creating a digital hub in the heart of this thriving community, which will use that talent and expertise to transform the BBC, not only in Scotland \u0026ndash but throughout the UK.\"  In its final judgement on the new channel, Ofcom says: \"We recognise that there are uncertainties about the take-up of the new channel and the content it will include.  \"However, we are satisfied the BBC has shown its proposal will deliver public value by broadening the options available to viewers in Scotland, providing a greater Scottish -focus in its news coverage and delivering more content designed to reflect the lives of people in Scotland.\"  It says that any adverse impacts on competition are \"likely to be fairly limited.\"  Although it adds: \"We acknowledge that some stakeholders, particularly STV, may experience negative effects as a result of the  BBC\u0026rsquos proposal.  \"However, taking these impacts on rivals into account, we do not believe that the proposed channel is likely to have a negative impact on citizens and consumers.\"  The director of BBC Scotland, Donalda MacKinnon, said: \"Bringing another 60 highly-trained technology roles to Scotland, on top of the 50-plus we already have, is a sign of the BBC\u0026rsquos commitment to spreading our investment across the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"iain-mcwhirter-gamble-for-the-snp-in-asking-voters-too-many-complex-questions","story":"              MONEY, as we know, never sleeps. The former editor of the Daily Record, Murray Foote, has revealed that, on the eve of the independence referendum in 2014, he was deluged by requests from financial businesses and hedge funds desperate for advance knowledge of the title\u0026rsquos eve-of-vote opinion poll. With commendable directness he told them to get lost. Others may not have been so punctilious. Analysis of currency movements by financial website Bloomberg suggests that hedge funds made a fortune from insider dealing over the Brexit referendum in by trading on unpublished exit polls. It\u0026rsquos being called the great Brexit short.  Well, the hedgies and short-sellers could be in for another couple of bumper shorts now that the SNP is edging closer to endorsing not just another independence referendum but also one on Brexit. Referendum-fatigued voters may quail at the thought of two repeat referendums but the indications are that the Scottish Government is moving rapidly in the direction of backing the People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit. The Brexit minister, Michael Russell, and the Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, have both made \u0026ldquoI-am-not-opposed statements in the past week, which suggests that they support another vote on Europe, even if their leader has yet to make her position clear.  There has been an intense debate in the SNP over a second EU referendum, with influential former advisers like Kevin Pringle and Noel Dolan advising the First Minister that she has a moral and political duty to lead the opposition to Brexit, Labour having lost the plot on Europe. The argument is that Scots voted by 62 per cent to 38% in favour of Remain and they should be represented by the Scottish Government. They have despaired at Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos apparent willingness to accept a special deal on access to the single market as an acceptable \u0026ldquosecond best to EU membership.  It\u0026rsquos understandable that Ms Sturgeon has been somewhat resistant to these representations. She\u0026rsquos already under pressure from the \u0026ldquomandate tendency in her party to call the second independence referendum forthwith, on the grounds that the \u0026ldquotriple-lock mandate she won after last year\u0026rsquos Holyrood vote is time limited. But, having called a referendum and then uncalled it only a year ago, she does not want to risk falling into the trap of calling another one she is likely to lose. She sees no romantic glory in heroic failure.  As for the second Europe referendum, her anxieties have been two fold. First, while Scots may be dedicated Europeans, there has been only a slight movement in the UK opinion polls toward Remain and any People\u0026rsquos Vote would have to be UK-wide. Moreover, Ms Sturgeon is bound to be uneasy at the possible precedent that might be set by holding a referendum on the deal struck by Theresa May next year. As former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars has argued, there would be similar demands in Scotland for a confirmatory vote on whatever deal the First Minister might strike with the rest of the UK after Scottish independence.  It\u0026rsquos a difficult one, made more so by the suggestion that the second Brexit and independence votes might be held simultaneously. Mr Russell has refused to rule this out in cryptic statements on the relationship between the two ballots. A double-headed referendum might on the surface make some sense. It would be more efficient to hold the two votes on the same day and they are politically closely related. Many Scottish voters only voted No in 2014 because they believed that it was the way to guarantee that Scotland remained in the EU. So why not deal with both issues on the same day?  Well, a moment\u0026rsquos thought on a double-headed referendum reveals some serious problems. For a start, voters might feel they are being railroaded by these referendums and many might refuse to vote, or even vote No, because they\u0026rsquore fed up with being asked the same questions again. There is also the problem of the referendums cancelling each other out. If voters believe that Britain is likely to rejoin the EU in ballot one would that not make them less likely to support independence in number two?  Then there are the Scots eurosceptics. It is not just the remnants of Ukip that dislike the EU. An influential strand of Nationalist opinion, led by the former minister Alex Neil, wants to stay out. Many on the Left of the Nationalist movement are unhappy at the lack of democracy in the Brussels bureaucracy and its attitude to small nations like Greece. Yes-supporting organisations like Common Weal and Radical Independence Campaign would argue that, if there is to be a multi-option referendum on Brexit, it should include an option of Scotland remaining in the European Economic Area and not being subject to the Common Agricultural Policy or the EU Court of Justice.  There is no indication that Theresa May is likely to endorse a second Scottish referendum or a second EU referendum for that matter. She said last year that \u0026ldquonow is not the time for an independence referendum and, given the chaotic state of the Brexit negotiations since then, she\u0026rsquos hardly likely to want another referendum on Europe. Westminster needs to pass a Section 30 order permitting Scotland to hold a constitutional referendum and there is not a cat in hell\u0026rsquos chance of that happening at present.  Nor is there much momentum behind the People\u0026rsquos Vote, despite 100,000 marching in London, because Labour remains opposed.  So this may all seem rather academic. But it is right to look at these questions because politics is in such a fluid state that almost anything is possible in the next couple of years. The UK Government might fall and there might be a \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit, which would generate a UK-wide revulsion at the whole project. There are signs that Scottish No-voting opinion-formers are reconsidering independence. The SNP is right to make contingency plans.  There is a vacuum in UK politics and Ms Sturgeon could perform a valuable leadership role in leading the opposition to Brexit, in time. However, she should be careful about voter tolerance. The money men may love referendums but there\u0026rsquos no sign that Scottish voters have yet regained their enthusiasm for being handed complex, divisive questions that the politicians can\u0026rsquot resolve."},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-demand-policy-changes-as-well-as-new-faces","story":"              JEANE Freeman came under attack within minutes of being confirmed as Health Secretary yesterday, as Labour raised a previous briefing against a nurse.  Mr Freeman was accused last year of contributing to a smear against an audience member who challenged Nicola Sturgeon in a BBC TV general election debate.  Mr Freeman and SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC had appeared on the show to defend the party\u0026rsquos record, describing themselves as the \u0026lsquospin girls\u0026rsquo.  Mr Cherry wrongly claimed nurse Claire Austin, who had attacked Ms Sturgeon over NHS pay and said she had been forced to use a foodbank, was the wife of a Tory councillor.  She later apologised for the remark, which had been circulating on social media.  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who had been sitting next to the pair in the BBC\u0026rsquos spin room, said Ms Freeman had encouraged Ms Cherry to make the claim on air.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is surprising that Nicola Sturgeon has appointed the person behind smearing a nurse who had the guts to challenge the First Minister during the election television debate.  \u0026ldquoThere are huge challenges in the health portfolio, especially in terms of funding and staffing. We need a Health Secretary that is going to support staff and stand-up for patients.  The instant attack was a sign the opposition do not intend to be deflected by the reshuffle.  The other parties said the new faces would mean little if they were not accompanied by new ideas and new priorities from the government.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said the government was \u0026ldquoout of touch and out of ideas.  She said: \u0026ldquoOn the day Nicola Sturgeon chose to shake up her government, she had to shelve her flagship Bill to reform the education system and oversaw the worst cancer waiting times on record.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile the economy secretary has been booted from his job to plan a referendum campaign, which says something about Keith Brown\u0026rsquos performance or the SNP\u0026rsquos priorities - or most likely both.  \u0026ldquoThis reshuffle is long overdue but the real change Scotland wants and needs won\u0026rsquot come from changing the odd Cabinet Secretary - it will come from changing the government.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added: \u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required. If the change in the ministerial team is not matched by a change of policy then our NHS will continue to decline.  Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: \u0026ldquoTwo years on from the Holyrood election in which the SNP lost their majority, the need for bold action from Scottish Ministers has never been greater.  \u0026ldquoGreen MSPs have been leading the change in this session of parliament, influencing budgets, the income tax system and social security legislation.

Across the UK, the typical house price in June stood at a new record high of \u0026pound215,444, up 0.5% month on month, Nationwide Building Society said.  House prices are 2% higher than a year ago.  Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u0027s chief economist, said: \"Annual house price growth fell to its slowest pace for five years in June. However, at 2%, this was only modestly below the 2.4% recorded the previous month.\"  Regionally, in the second quarter of this year, London was the only area where house prices are lower than a year ago - following a trend also seen in the first quarter of 2018.  In the second quarter, house prices in London stood at \u0026pound468,845 on average - a 1.9% annual fall.  Despite the downward price movement in London, house prices there are still more than 50% above their 2007 peak.  By comparison, house prices in the UK generally are 15% higher, Nationwide said.  The East Midlands had the strongest annual house price growth in the second quarter, with prices up by 4.4%, followed by the West Midlands, which saw a 4.3% increase, and Wales with a 4% uplift.  In Scotland, house prices were 3.1% higher than a year earlier, while in Northern Ireland they have seen a 2.1% increase.  Mr Gardner continued: \"Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.  \"Overall, we continue to expect house prices to rise by around 1% over the course of 2018.\"  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Tight supply, a healthy labour market and a continued lengthening of mortgage terms - 30-year loans now are common - will help to prevent prices from falling outright.  \"But it is inevitable that house prices will grow at a slower rate than households\u0027 incomes during a period of rising mortgage rates.\"  He continued: \"We expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5% over the course of 2018 and a mere 2% over 2019.\"  Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), said: \"On the one hand, the squeeze on incomes and unrealistic asking prices is reducing activity and confidence to move, particularly in price-sensitive areas such as London.  \"On the other hand, the market continues to be supported by low interest rates and overall supply shortages, although we have found recently that listings and viewings are on the rise. This will translate into more sales if buyers and sellers recognise the new market realities.\"  Mark Dyason, Managing Director, Thistle Finance, said: \"House prices in Scotland have surged over the past quarter compared to the rest of the UK.  \"Over the past three months, Scotland is the only market to have delivered positive price growth.  \"On an annual basis, price growth in Scotland is lagging behind Wales but significantly stronger than England, which is being weighed down by the capital.  \"Despite continued uncertainty around Brexit and the ongoing squeeze on household finances, Scotland\u0027s housing market has a spring in its step.  \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore seeing a lot of development activity north of the border, as capital that would traditionally have stayed in London flows elsewhere.  \u0026ldquoAgainst a backdrop of weak supply and relatively strong demand, prices in Scotland are likely to continue to edge up during the second half of the year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"culture-strategy-for-scotland-draft-document-aims-to-put-culture-at-centre-of-government-policies","story":"              THE first view of Scotland\u0027s new Culture Strategy is unveiled today, as it is published for a public consultation.

The six women and three men, seven of them first elected in 2016, increase the ministerial ranks from 13 to 14.  Three are committee conveners, and five are Parliamentary Liaison Officers (PLOs), who act\u0026nbspas the eyes and ears of cabinet secretaries around Holyrood.  The new ministers are Kate Forbes, PLO to finance secretary Derek Mackay, who becomes the new minister for public finance and digital economy.

Backbencher Ash Denham, whose decision to send her children to private school sparked controversy in the 2016 election, becomes minister for community safety.

The First minister\u0026nbsphas made sure half her cabinet ministers are women. She has also, perhaps, made sure half also went to Glasgow University, her alma mater.  Fully 10 of the 12-strong cabinet went to one of Scotland\u0027s ancients at some point in their education. Only two, new face Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, and Michael Matheson, the new transport secretary, did not. Both attended a college that has subsequently been redesignated as a university.    Jeane Freeman  Glasgow University had seven out of the 10\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspseats in Ms Sturgeon\u0027s old cabinet.\u0026nbspDepartures from the previous administration\u0026nbspincluded Shona Robison and Angela Constance, who both studied at\u0026nbspGlasgow University in the same era as Ms Sturgeon.  Despite the set back, Glasgow University ex-students continue to have more influence in the Scottish Government than those of Oxford and Cambridge combined have in the British cabinet.  Some 48 per cent of the January 2018 British cabinet attended Oxbridge, compared with 50 per of Glasgow ex-students in Ms Sturgeon\u0027s.  Only two of the 12 cabinet secretaries attended a fee-paying school.\u0026nbsp That is just under 17 per cent and compares with 34 per cent of ministers in Ms May\u0027s Tory government. Around 20 per cent of MSPs are privatedly educated, about five times the Scottish national average.\u0026nbsp  Some Scottish commentators dislike any comparison between Glasgow - and other Scottish ancient universities - and Oxbridge.\u0026nbsp They argue that the four old Scottish institutions Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and St Andrews were never as elitist as their English equivalents.    Glasgow University  This, they say, also applies to Dundee, which claims ancient status because it was once a college of St Andrews.  Other analysts counter that it\u0027s important to understand the shared youth experiences of politicians - and the connections\u0026nbsp many made to each other when in their teens and early 20s.\u0026nbsp  Professor Michael Keating of Aberdeen University, reckons Oxbridge is still more influential than the ancient Scottish universities, because of its graduates abilities to reach the very top of British power.  Graduates of the five universities can command an absolute majority on the floor of Holyrood, something no party can do. They have, however, lost their grip on the Scottish benches at Westminster after the dramatic changes in the 2017 general election.

Well-known figures from the arts world joined forces with human rights campaigners calling on Ireland not to send an entry to the song contest.  Organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC), the campaign kicked off at Dublin\u0027s famous Ha\u0027penny Bridge.  A petition set up in support of the boycott has been signed by almost 3,500 people.  Also backing the call are the Musicians\u0027 Union of Ireland, the trade union for musicians, singers and music professionals, and Irish Equity, the trade union for actors, dancers, directors, and stage and set builders and designers.  Among the protesters was Irish artist and Riverdance set designer Robert Ballagh, who said: \"I have always supported the rights of the Palestinian people and I\u0027m very concerned that the Israeli state will use the possibility of staging Eurovision in Jerusalem as a propaganda exercise and I become uneasy when any state begin to employ culture as a propaganda tool.  \"We\u0027ve seen the dangers of that in past history.  \"I want to urge RTE not to send an Irish song to the contest.\"  Irish Senator David Norris said it was \"inappropriate\" to hold an entertainment contest in Israel.  He said: \"Dum-dum bullets, which expand in the wound and create appalling injuries, are being used against children in Gaza.  \"I think it\u0027s very inappropriate to have an entertainment (contest) there when all this is going on a couple of miles away.  \"I think people will pay attention if Ireland pull out because it has such a history in the song contest.  \"It\u0027s loved all over the world but a lot of people would be sensitive to this.  \"It\u0027s nothing against the woman who won the contest but it is against having it in that country which is behaving in an appalling way.\"  Irish artist Felim Egan, who has been involved in sending flotillas to Gaza, said he was held for nine days in an Israeli prison when he attempted to enter the country a number of years ago.  \"I have heard stories of people\u0027s everyday life in Gaza and their resilience is remarkable given the conditions they live in,\" he said.  \"No water, no sanitation and this is all deliberate actions from the Israelis.  \"It\u0027s a terrible situation for them.  \"The more of us to get behind the campaign the better.

Crowley, who co-hosted the show in Dublin in 1997, said: \"There\u0027s a resonance with the situation in Palestine for Irish people because in our past we were disenfranchised and taken over by a superior power.  \"We understand what it\u0027s like to be evicted from homes, to lose our land and properties and feel like we\u0027ve no entitlements anymore.  \"Our relationship with Great Britain has improved so much and I would love to think Palestine and Israel could look to the future and maybe do something similar.  \"I want to raise awareness of this as there\u0027s so many people who love Eurovision and we could draw their attention to it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"everett-in-glasgow-to-back-the-redevelopment-of-citizens-theatre","story":"              THE actor Rupert Everett has put his weight behind the redevelopment of one of Scotland\u0027s most famous theatres.

He is today looking around the theatre before it closes for a two year, \u0026pound20m redevelopment.  Everett once said that he \"really blossomed\" as an actor at the theatre.  He told TimeOut that \"the company...was putting on plays that were far-fetched and demanding, things, for instance, by [Carlo] Goldoni.  \"Because they didn\u0027t patronise their audience, everyone adored it.\"  The historic venue will re-open in the autumn of 2020, and in the intervening period much of its theatrical work will be staged at the Tramway, also in Glasgow.

The Save Meadowbank group is objecting to plans for a new sports centre in place of the current stadium, as well as proposals for hundreds of homes to built on much of the surrounding site.  It currently has 34 public facilities, including football pitches, an athletics track, a velodrome and a gym.  Meadowbank Stadium was the first to host events at two Commonwealth Games - 1970 and 1986 - and is the home ground of Edinburgh City FC.  Save Meadowbank campaigner Russell McLarty said: \"This shows the overwhelming sense people have that more consultation is required before anything more is done on the Meadowbank site.  \"The Council planning portal shows a support rate for the plan of lower than 14%.  \"Councillors must now look again at this controversial development and reflect on the sheer strength of opposition there is to it.\"  The petition is to be handed to Edinburgh City Council on Friday, when its planning sub-committee meets to consider the plans.  Signatures include those made online and on paper, campaigners say.  A report put to the committee recommends the 50-year-old stadium is redeveloped into a new sports centre, as it is no longer \"fit for purpose\".  It said plans for the \"modern\" facilities depend upon money being raised by three surrounding Meadowbank sites being turned into commercial and residential properties.  Councillor Cammy Day, deputy council leader, said: \"Recent meetings with campaigners have proved invaluable in helping us understand the views of local stakeholders on the wider site.  \"We recognise more engagement and consultation is required on specific heights, design and massing, as well as the number of different uses proposed on the site.  \"That is why we are only seeking planning in principle for the wider Meadowbank site, and all these details will be subject to extensive community consultation.  \"We are seeking approval for the detailed designs of a brand new \u0026pound41m sports centre to replace the old venue which is now closed.  \"Both plans will be determined by councillors on Friday when two separate hearings will be held.  \"Should these plans be approved, officers have committed to further engagement with the community.\""},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.                                                                                                        Carol Sadler, from Jobcentre Plus said: “Universal Credit offers tailored support, which includes more personalised help from a work coach. The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 11:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Temporary reprieve for public toilets welcomed","story":"CLOSURE-threatened public toilets in Caithness and other parts of the Highlands have won a temporary reprieve.Highland Council has decided to put its plan on hold until a review of toilet provision in its area is carried out \u0026ndash but it will not be completed until October.In the meantime, the toilets threatened with closure will remain open.The local authority proposed closing 28 of the 96 public toilets in the Highlands while charging 50p for those that stay open. The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 11:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 11:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race.

I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 11:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A Wetherspoon spokesman said some pubs would be without John Smith’s and Strongbow cider but said that supplier Heineken had advised both would be available again in a couple of days.            He said: “Wetherspoon has the advantage that it sources its wide range of drinks from a number of suppliers, so has not been too badly affected.“Heineken has been the company with the biggest issues and they have told us that all is getting back to normal.”Punch Taverns, which has around 1,300 pubs, said it has had shortfalls of John Smith’s and Amstel for almost a week, with Birra Moretti also now in short supply.A spokesman said: “We are working closely with suppliers to ensure that alternative products are available and we continue to communicate with our publicans to minimise any disruption. We are hoping that product availability will be restored within the next few days.”A Heineken spokeswoman said: “We’d like to reassure beer drinkers that all our breweries are operating at full capacity, and we’re working 24/7 to get beers to our customers as quickly as possible.”            READ MORE: Pork shortage looms as major pig abattoir closes due to CO2 deficitEi, the UK’s largest pub group which runs the Craft Union and Bermondsey Pub Company chains, said: “We are aware of the issue relating to a shortage in the supply of CO2 and are working with our suppliers to minimise any disruption to our customers and our publicans.”The Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) visitor attraction said it had been unable to get the dry ice it needed for its new show due to the European shortage of CO2.Resident scientist Sam Langford said: “Here at GSC we use carbon dioxide in its solid form in our science shows to demonstrate a number of scientific phenomena, including sublimation, ocean acidification and the three states of matter.            “However, recently we’ve had some trouble obtaining dry ice from our suppliers due to a European shortage of CO2.“Our plans for our brand new summer show have been put on hold.“Whilst this is a small problem for GSC, dry ice and other forms of CO2 being in short supply is a major problem for a number of industries for whom it is an essential product.”Food wholesaler Booker said it was limiting sales of some lines to 10 cases per customer per day to prevent “sub-wholesaling”.The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, said the move was to preserve availability and satisfied the “vast majority of Booker customers”.            A Booker spokeswoman said: “Due to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. We are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers.”Tesco said the CO2 shortage had not resulted in any availability issues on any product lines.However, Booker’s move to ration sales followed Scotland’s largest pig processing plant suspending its slaughtering process, Coca-Cola temporarily pausing some production lines and Morrisons and Ocado telling customers that the shortage had led to disruption to some frozen product lines.Quality Pork Limited in Brechin, Angus, carried out its last slaughter on Tuesday due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.There are plans to send around 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say the CO2 shortage could have serious implications if the shortage continues.British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said the situation was getting “pretty tight”, exacerbated by the hot temperatures.Mr Allen said: “The frustration is the lack of information. We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.“Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won’t be helping. If things don’t alter this week, we’re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.”Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a “potentially huge effect” on British food production.A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said CO2 supply issues remained and retailers and suppliers were working hard to ensure food availability was maintained.The BRC said: “We are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages.“However, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected.”The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the “worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760548.1530094763!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp rising stars handed key government roles","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tA tranche of rising stars of the SNP have today been appointed as junior ministers by \u0026#160Nicola Sturgeon as she completed her cabinet reshuffle.\t\t\t\tSeven MSPs who were only elected in the 2016 Holyrood election have been promoted to Government posts, including one new minister in her 20s and two in their early thirties.

Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":null,"title":"world s first hydrogen ferry to be built in scotland","story":"\t\t\t\tFerguson Marine Engineering Limited successfully led a European consortium bid that has been awarded €9.3m (£8.19m) to support the construction and launch of a sea-going car and passenger ferry fuelled by hydrogen.            The pioneering development, named HySeas III, is expected to cost around €12.6m (£11.1m) and will be jointly led by Ferguson Marine and the University of St Andrews.
