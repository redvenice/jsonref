I can’t believe he would say that.‘Stevenage has got all the amenities you could possibly want. It’s safe and peaceful.’The 73-year-old and his wife Valerie, 76, were speaking on the drive of their sprawling six-bedroom house where the Hamilton lived as a teenager.A blue plaque honouring the young racing driver used to hang on the wall, before the couple added an extension. The plaque read: ‘Lewis Hamilton Racing Driver lived here 1997-2001.’‘I don’t know how he could describe this house as a “slum”,’ Mr Lugmayer added.‘When Hamilton lived here there were six bedrooms and four bathrooms.‘He lived here when he got his first contract with Mercedes.

We were neighbours.‘It would be impossible to say this area is a slum.‘I have lived here with my family for 23 years. I have brought up my two children with my wife. It has been a great place for them. It is very peaceful and quiet. We are happy here.‘It is very safe, we never have anything to worry about.

They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making \u0027many untrue reports\u0027 about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.\u0027Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,\u0027 the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.  A police station seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park  Residents are seen lining up inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China\u0027s Xinjiang region. Across the region, a growing number of internment camps have been built, where by some estimates one million Muslims are detainedHowever, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said - barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees - or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there - are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.\u0027The camp didn\u0027t pay any money, not a single cent,\u0027 he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. \u0027Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.\u0027Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\u0027American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,\u0027 she said. \u0027What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?\u0027The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security. An image of Chinese President Xi Jinping projected on a screen near a carpark in Kashgar, western China\u0027s Xinjiang region  One of the internment camps the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park (pictured), opened under the national anti-poverty pushAbout two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a \u0027vocational skills education and training center\u0027 in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\u0027Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,\u0027 the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this \u0027global issue.\u0027Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be \u0027unproblematic,\u0027 he said, adding that the center is government-operated.\u0027We\u0027re making our contribution to eradicating poverty,\u0027 Wu told the AP over the phone.The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said. Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.\u0027I don\u0027t dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn\u0027t come here,\u0027 one Uighur student said. \u0027The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.\u0027  Two layers of barbed wire fencing ring the \u0027Hotan City apparel employment training base\u0027 where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China\u0027s Xinjiang region  A building with the words \u0027Neighborhood Center\u0027 at the top is seen behind barbed wire fences in the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China\u0027s Xinjiang regionThe segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida\u0027s main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a \u0027military facility.\u0027 Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an \u0027apparel employment training base.\u0027Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as \u0027Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person\u0027 and \u0027No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.\u0027Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida\u0027s case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.\u0027There are watchtowers throughout,\u0027 Ruser said. \u0027There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.\u0027The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men\u0027s, women\u0027s and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp\u0027s sewing factory floor.Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear\u0027s marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she\u0027s surprised the workers are \u0027friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.\u0027    Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to  a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work  Residents past by the entrance to the \u0027Hotan City apparel employment training base\u0027 where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China\u0027s Xinjiang regionBadger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island\u0027s Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A\u0026ampM, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it\u0027s impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.\u0027We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,\u0027 he said.Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.In recent years, Badger imported sportswear - jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more - from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.It\u0027s unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention \u0027training\u0027 there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.  Muslim trainees work in a garment factory in the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang          A gate of what is officially known as a vocational skills education centre is photographed in Dabancheng, XinjiangNew Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.\u0027Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,\u0027 said Smith. \u0027U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.\u0027The detention camp system is part of China\u0027s increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn\u0027t have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.\u0027They didn\u0027t teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,\u0027 said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director\u0027s words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.\u0027We\u0027re going to open a factory, you\u0027re going to work,\u0027 Koksebek recalled him as saying. \u0027We\u0027ll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.\u0027This fall, months after Koksebek\u0027s release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.          Young Muslims read from official Chinese language textbooks  at the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center          A building of what is officially called a vocational skills education centre is photographed in Hotan, XinjiangIn October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that \u0027some trainees\u0027 were nearly done with their \u0027courses.\u0027\u0027We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,\u0027 Zahir said.The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang\u0027s economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read \u0027House of Workers\u0027 could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder\u0027s wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn\u0027t answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for \u0027political training.\u0027 The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter\u0027s clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar\u0027s brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.          The exterior of Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center sits behind barbed wire in Hotan, Xinjiang          An armed police officer stands guard outside the entrance of a vocational skills education centre in Hotan, XinjiangKaliaskar learned her daughter wasn\u0027t being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn\u0027t leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.\u0027They say they\u0027re teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she\u0027s well educated and had a job,\u0027 said Kaliaskar. \u0027What\u0027s the point of this training?\u0027A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u0027d be taken straight back to the camps for \u0027further education.\u0027Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing\u0027s past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.\u0027I never asked the government to find work for my husband,\u0027 said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she\u0027s not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek\u0027s husband used to earn.Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.\u0027They say it\u0027s a factory, but it\u0027s an excuse for detention. They don\u0027t have freedom, there\u0027s no time for him to talk with me,\u0027 she said. \u0027They say they found a job for him.

She\u0027s broadside onto the beach. \u0027In my opinion Falmouth shipyard tugs won\u0027t be powerful enough to pull her off the suction effect of sand. A salvage tug is needed but they no longer station one at Falmouth... I\u0027m claiming wreckers\u0027 rights!\u0027              A map of the UK showing the wind pattern over  at 8am todayMichael Hall, 62, a retired Navy officer from Falmouth was among those at the scene and earlier warned that a rescue would not be easy.He said: \u0027I heard this ship had run aground so I came down to take a look. I\u0027d imagine it dropped its anchor and dragged it into the beach. It\u0027s broadside so the ship\u0027s structure is acting as a sail.\u0027The winds are gale force with between three and six foot waves. The ship was there when I got up at 7. It must have happened in the early hours of the morning.\u0027This is the first one that\u0027s run aground in a long time, the last was on New Year\u0027s Eve in 1978. That was in bad weather as well, she hit the rocks and it was difficult to free her.\u0027Here there are two issues. If she comes into the beach she will stick in the sand. Because the waves are rocking her back and forwards you have an issue.\u0027If she had cargo on board you could get it off and make it lighter. If you went to tow her off as it is it would be incredible difficult to free her because of the suction effect of the sand - it creates a vacuum. It\u0027s a problem.\u0027Mark Thomas, senior coastal operations manager for the Coastguard, said: \u0027With the horrendous conditions the ship has drifted to shore. She\u0027s on the beach, we think the hull part of the ship is just on the reef.\u0027At the minute they are safe on board, there are no injuries. We\u0027re working with the harbour officers to get a tow rope attached.\u0027The conditions are horrendous, the harbour rugs are working at the very limit of their conditions with waves breaking over the deck. The plan is to tow her out when the tide comes in at about lunchtime. It\u0027s a dangerous operation, there\u0027s lots that could go wrong.\u0027A crowd of around 50 curious onlookers gathered at the scene.           A tug and rib monitor the situation with the Russian carrier ship Kuzma Minin aground off Falmouth in Cornwall today    Emergency services launched a major operation after the Kuzma Minin became stranded           The 16,000-tonne Russian cargo ship ran aground off Gyllyngvase Beach in Cornwall today          HM Coastguard was co-cordinating assistance to the bulk carrier in Cornwall this morningFurther details emerged about how it became stranded so close to the beach. Yesterday the ship was anchored several miles off the coast of Falmouth and spent several hours sheltering from the oncoming storm.Through the night it continuously moving in a limited area. But at 3am The Kuzma began to slip anchor and drifted towards the shoreline. At 4.30am the crew and tide manage to pull the Kuzma back out to sea.Over the next hour she can be seen moving back and forth between the coast and sea - gradually moving towards the shoreline.At 5.22am the Kuzma Minin is grounded on a sandbank less than 100feet of Gyllynvase beach and the rescue operation is launched.The ship\u0027s home port is Murmansk. Although it is empty at the moment, it usually carries cargo around northern Europe, including Port Talbot in Wales.In a statement, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: \u0027HM Coastguard is currently co-ordinating assistance to the Kuzma Minin, a Russian flagged 180 metre bulk carrier, which dragged and grounded on the western side of the port entrance between Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches at around 5.40am today.\u0027The vessel has 18 Russian crew on board but there are no reported injuries. There is no cargo on board. She currently has a list of five degrees but there is no report of any pollution.          Gales have already been recorded at up to 74mph in Cornwall and 40 knots on the River Tamar           The vessel which ran aground this morning has 18 Russian crew on board, but there is no cargo\u0027HM Coastguard and Devon \u0026amp Cornwall Police have declared a major incident due to the large number of people that use the beach and the disruption to traffic in the town.\u0027The Secretary of State\u0027s Representative (SOSRep) Maritime Salvage \u0026amp Intervention is closely monitoring the situation and the local Environment Group is also being kept informed.\u0027Tugs are on their way to the vessel and Falmouth RNLI all-weather lifeboat is standing by at the scene. Falmouth Coastguard Rescue Team have cordoned off an area around the ship.\u0027HM Coastguard Search and Rescue helicopter based at Newquay was used to transfer a marine pilot on to the vessel.\u0027          The Russian cargo ship ran aground off a beach on the south coast of Britain this morning          Emergency services launched the operation after the ship became stranded in Cornwall          The RNLI launched out of Falmouth with pilot boats from the nearby docks also in the waterA former Falmouth senior pilot captain had said local tugs do not have the power pull the grounded Russian cargo near a beach in Cornwall to safety. David Barnicoat said he feared \u0027our tugs won\u0027t be powerful enough to get her off unless the wind dies right away\u0027. He added: \u0027You need something of about 100 tonnes and we just don\u0027t have that available.\u0027He also warned of the risk of pollution if the ship hit nearby rocks. He said: \u0027It\u0027s a little bit rocky where she is, so there could be some pollution. Just to the south-west of the beach it is all rocky shoreline so there is potential for pollution.\u0027 Commuters were being warned of potentially treacherous conditions on the roads today amid a series of weather warnings. The Met Office urged rush hour drivers to take care with heavy showers and strong winds expected to batter parts of the UK.London and the South East, Northern Ireland, South West England and Wales have been issued with warnings today, with heavy rain and gusts of 65mph expected. Heavy rain is expected between 5am and 9pm across much of West, South and parts of Mid Wales, with strong winds expected to affect the Welsh coast.The rain warning for South Wales, including Cardiff and Swansea, and Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and West Sussex is in effect until 9pm.The worst of the weather is expected to have cleared by mid-afternoon but further east the worst conditions are likely to be during the afternoon and early evening."},{"url":null,"title":"Security guard grapples customer floor supermarket entrance","story":"The man tries pushing off a security guard at a Morrisons supermarket in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

She denied Amazon searched for places with low local business rates to avoid paying as much tax as competitors.Clayton Hirst, from John Lewis, told the committee that businesses like his face much higher business rates and taxes for employees compared to online-only retailers.Committee chairman Mr Betts made a formal request on the Amazon boss to provide her business rate figures and sales figures.Ms Smith said she would \u0027seek advice\u0027 before handing over the company\u0027s figures.She was questioned after shocking new statistics revealed 93,000 retail jobs have been lost in the past year amid a crunch on the high street.

You can see from some of the emojis used that it is perceived as quite comical as if it is a joke. Fat jokes are perceived as acceptable.In terms of impact, the first thing I would say is the impact is great. No matter what the subject, stigma discrimination is not acceptable. It doesn\u0027t have to be just about weight.You have to think about the impact on the person. It can be quite vast and very serious. It could impact their mental and physical health but also self-harming and suicidal thoughts.You have to think about how you behave and treat different people.We know that weight stigma is very pervasive. People have these types of experiences almost daily across a range of settings.They are being reported more in public settings such as on public transports, probably because of social media. It is being highlighted more.There needs to be greater restrictions on social media and throughout in terms of weight stigma and discrimination.If this was another topic that someone was being stigmatised for or treated the way this lady was treated then there would be repercussions.The social media would have intervened and depending on the topic it might even go further, such as legal or whatever."},{"url":null,"title":"Boy Downs Syndrome 5 takes modelling world storm Sainsburys Christmas advert","story":"    Frankie Porter, five, has appeared in Sainsbury\u0027s Christmas advert as a bauble          The youngster, who also has type A diabetes, loves modelling, his mother says          Frankie Porter made his first venture into modelling nine months ago and has already appeared in high-street adverts for Marks and Spencer and Jeans for Genes\u0027Just because you\u0027ve put on a seatbelt, it doesn\u0027t mean you...Share this articleAnd it looks like his success is set to continue as Frankie has more shoots lined up following the success of the Sainsbury\u0027s Christmas advert. Ms Porter, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: \u0027I took him for a photoshoot in March this year just to see if he liked it and he took to it like a duck to water and really enjoyed it.\u0027Frankie had always enjoyed having his picture taken but I was so proud of him after his first shoot.\u0027He takes direction really well despite the fact he uses Makaton - a language programme that uses signs and symbols - as a form of communication as he struggles sometimes.

Galleries have made progress in better representing female artists “but it has been slow for too long. We are happy that it is speeding up”.There will be about 30 artists represented by around 60 works from the Tate collection including paintings, sculpture, photography, drawing and film.Tate said the rehang was part of a commitment to increase the representation of women across its galleries. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, said: “The recent histories of the Turner prize, Tate’s exhibition programme and contemporary acquisitions reflect the critical role of women in the history of British art over the last 60 years.“This presentation, 60 Years, will offer a significant moment to recognise and celebrate a selection of Britain’s most important artists working from the 1960s to the present day.”Highlights of the display will include the first video installation to be acquired by Tate: Susan Hiller’s Belshazzar’s Feast, the Writing on Your Wall (1983-4).It entered the collection in 1984 and is a multimedia installation that includes video, photography, sound, soft furnishings and artificial plants to recreate a living room late at night. Hiller was inspired by newspaper reports of apparitions seen on television screens in the days when broadcasting ended at around midnight.There are flickering bonfire flames on the TV screen and a recording of Hiller’s young son trying to describe the National Gallery’s Rembrandt painting Belshazzar’s Feast from memory. The work was last shown at Tate Britain in 2003.Other works will include Sarah Lucas’s 1997 sculpture Pauline Bunny, a mannequin figure made from stuffed pairs of tights a painting, Zebe (2010), by the artist Tomma Abts, who won the Turner prize in 2006 for her intuitively made and precisely sized abstract paintings and an example of the work of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.Yiadom-Boakye is best known for her paintings of black subjects, people largely absent from the European painting tradition. But she has repeatedly said it is not a political statement. “It just seemed normal to me,” she told the Observer. “It wasn’t my intention to put black faces back in the picture. It wasn’t political like that at all.”The Yiadom-Boakye painting to be displayed will be The Generosity (2010), acquired in 2012.More recently acquired pieces will include mixed media works by Chetwynd, the anarchic artist – previously known by first names Spartacus and Marvin Gaye – who has installed two enormous slug sculptures outside the gallery for Christmas.Tate said the display was one of a number across its galleries in 2019 that would celebrate female artists. They include monographic shows devoted to Natalia Goncharova, Dora Maar and Dorothea Tanning at Tate Modern Sol Calero at Tate Liverpool Anna Boghiguian and Otobong Nkanga at Tate St Ives and Rose Finn-Kelcey and Joanna Piotrowska at Tate Britain.It also precedes a wider rehang of Tate Britain planned for 2020.All galleries would admit they have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to representing female artists in their collections and displays.The National Portrait Gallery will, for example, next year stage the first major exhibition to tell the largely untold story of the women of pre-Raphaelite art. The show, Pre-Raphaelite Sisters, will shine light on artists such as Joanna Mary Wells, Marie Spartali Stillman, and Evelyn De Morgan, women left out of the history of a movement obsessed with its “male genius”.On Wednesday, the National Gallery will unveil a newly acquired and cleaned painting by Artemisia Gentileschi, the most celebrated female artist of the Italian baroque."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0c7076a06ed13ca2653d01020261aa70625b32/393_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d920f09f2b8113db43da380c4350110","title":"top 10 art exhibitions of 2018 adrian searle","story":"A Tacita Dean triple whammy, Picasso’s banner year, a shabby swimming pool and Glasgow queered up by Tai ShaniNational Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Academy, LondonIt could have been too much, an act of artistic hubris, for Tacita Dean to have three interrelated exhibitions this year. At the NPG, she made a new film portrait in which actors David Warner, Ben Whishaw and Stephen Dillane appear to react to one another, while never in fact being in the same room or the same country. Dean’s portrait films dwell on the subjects in the way paintings might. David Hockney smokes, Mario Merz sits in his garden, poet Michael Hamburger examines his apples, choreographer Merce Cunningham sits absolutely still in his dance studio. Nothing happens, except time, being, presence.At the National Gallery, Dean explored the idea of still life, through her own films and works from the museum’s collection and elsewhere. At the RA, she premiered Antigone, a double-screen 35mm film of great complexity. (Dillane is there again, with poet and classics scholar Anne Carson.) With its multiple layers and viewpoints, locations as far apart as Yellowstone, the Mississippi floodplains and Bodmin Moor, and Dean’s innovative technical manipulations – the entire film is edited in the camera – Antigone weaves together more than just the visible world. The conundrums of names, a solar eclipse, copulating dogs and Antigone and Sophocles all become part of the tapestry. If there is a narrative, it is life itself, and making sense of the things around us. This is Dean’s most ambitious work yet. My (triple) show of the year.Tate Modern, LondonAnni Albers made textiles not as a substitute for painting but on their own terms. Taking us from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College and Connecticut, this revelatory and beautifully installed exhibition shows just how innovative Albers was as a textile designer and weaver. Even at its most geometric, her work feels human and alive – less the product of the mechanics of the loom, the construction of a matrix of threads and fibres, warp and weft, than of the hand and the mind.SMK CopenhagenMartyred missionaries, personal and family history, body fragments and mementos – DanishVietnamese artist Danh Vo’s sculptures, installations and much besides infiltrated the National Museum of Denmark. Including letters from Henry Kissinger about his love of musicals and ballet, ceramic bowls decorated with the hideous violence of the conquistadores in New Spain, sections of a lifesize replica of the Statue of Liberty and a chandelier that had hung in the room where the Paris peace accord ended the Vietnam war were all brought together in a terrific exhibition.Palermo, SicilyThe European travelling biannual fetched up in Palermo, delving into the city’s history, its infrastructure position as a crossroads of migration at the edge of Europe. Highlights included Spanish artist Cristina Lucas’s vivid digital documentation of bombings of civilian targets, from 1911 to the present day, in a work of numbing, accumulated injustice. Meanwhile, Sicilian group Masbedo installed a projection of a puppet among the centuries of documents, denunciations, trials and secrets piled high in the state archives. This was the single best work I saw all year, a perfect combination of setting and intervention.Tate Modern, London Travelling from Paris to Tate Modern, Picasso 1932 told the story of a year through paintings and sculpture, letters, photographs and a host of archive material. But it was Picasso’s paintings, and in particular those that depict his sleeping lover, Marie-Thérèse Walter, whom he first met in the street in Paris in 1927 when she was just 17, that stand out. Picasso’s art became as fraught as his life in 1932, and his work was by turns tender, monstrous, magnificent and creepy, an ego in convulsion.The Store XVinyl Factory, London A terrific show of video, film and digital art that demanded repeated visits, Strange Days had 21 artists spread over three floors, curated by the New Museum in New York’s artistic director, Massimiliano Gioni. Lili Reynaud-Dewar dances, Amazonian fishermen caress their catch and Wong Ping provides a hilarious, brutal animation. Kahlil Joseph’s 20-minute loving homage to the Harlem music scene, Fly Paper, was the star work, ending with a quote from Chris Marker’s film Sans Soleil. “If they don’t see happiness in the picture, at least they’ll see the black.”Serpentine Sackler Gallery, LondonTwenty-five small paintings hung at a measured pace around the Serpentine Sackler gallery. Each a journey, begun with no clear idea of a resolution. No wonder I kept going back and forth, to and fro, walking with Tomma Abts. Her abstractions (rarely is the word so apt) made me feel abstracted, too – baffled and delighted. Games for the eye and trapdoors for the mind, their surfaces shuffle and sheer with perspectival anomalies, interrupted patterns, fault lines and shadowy recesses. Mesmerising.Hepworth sculpture prize, Wakefield Cerith Wyn Evans won the second Hepworth sculpture prize with a complex glass piece that hung alone in a small gallery. With its 27 blown glass flutes, translucent armatures and piping, the sculpture appears as an insubstantial filigree drawing. It is also a musical instrument. The two main elements play to one another, in an always shifting algorithmic call and response, emitting a low and haunting music. The work makes you intensely aware of space and time, of volume, acoustics and the ways we displace the air as we move. What a wonderful thing it is.Whitechapel Gallery, LondonThe Scandinavian duo turned the ground floor of the Whitechapel gallery into an ill-loved public swimming pool, replete with patrolling guards and the smell of chlorine. It left visitors teetering on the brink, unsure if they’d come to the right place, or where to hire a towel. The highpoint of their show, the empty pool might have been about the decline of public amenities, but it was also a kind of trompe l’oeil, a marvellously unhinged double-take.Glasgow International festival Tai Shani’s Tramway installation Dark Continent: Semiramis was the best and most frustrating thing the last GI festival had to offer. Part-installation, part-stage set, the work was as much tableau vivant as theatre. There were knickers, there was dirty talk, there was declaiming, and it was in 12 parts. Dangly things and geometric shapes and an object like a giant pink colon, or the snake in the garden, filled the stage. It was most peculiar, utterly memorable, and very queer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87dff4b3f305c017a403bd39fd7324f582506908/0_96_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4cc8f461bf10bd491816e9bfe33c235","title":"share your best photographs of the week with us","story":"We’re highlighting the best reader photography in print in the letters pages of the .

That came after similar warnings from Bonmarché and Superdry last week, when the Sports Direct boss, Mike Ashley, said the high street risked being “smashed to pieces” by dismal trading in the run-up to Christmas.Caroline Gulliver, an equity research analyst at Jefferies, said the online fashion retailer had underestimated the scale of discounting that would be required to be competitive on Black Friday. “We are disappointed that Asos, with all its rich customer data, was not able to plan and execute a better Black Friday,” she said.Concerns have also been raised by the relatively low number of shoppers visiting high streets and shopping centres, putting footfall level with this time last year when trading was heavily affected by ice and snow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c06f29fa20e080f7368c82a7910bf0a4a09158c/732_609_4323_2593/master/4323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8db5e366ece3ee9c338f1d1891faa38","title":"solar power energy firms government","story":"Government confirms anyone who adds solar from April 2019 will not be paid for excess electricity exported to gridThe government has said households that install solar panels in the future will be expected to give away unused clean power for free to energy firms earning multimillion-pound profits, provoking outrage from green campaigners.The mayor of London, big energy firms and environmentalists had urged ministers not to end the “export tariff” for solar panels under the feed-in tariff scheme, which is closing next year.But officials confirmed that anyone who adds solar from April 2019 will not be paid for any excess power they export to the grid.Climate change charity 10:10 said the decision was bizarre and urged a rethink to avoid pushing solar “off a cliff” next year.“It’s hard to fathom the government’s logic here. Solar has been a huge success story, seeing 1m homes and 1,000 schools taking clean energy and climate action into their own hands,” said Neil Jones, a campaigner at the group.Green peer Jenny Jones said the step was a “very bad call”, while people took to social media to brand it “absolutely outrageous” and “shocking”.The change will not affect the 800,000-plus homes that have already fitted solar panels since the feed-in tariff scheme launched in 2010.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was ending the export tariff, which provides a guaranteed price for all unused solar electricity, to minimise costs to all consumers. The policy did not align with its industrial strategy, it added.The government is understood to be preparing to announce a market-based replacement to the export tariff early in the new year, which would write the rules for how energy suppliers could buy the excess power, though they would not be mandated to do so.However, there is expected to be a hiatus between the export tariff’s demise at the end of March and any new regime, meaning new solar households will be giving power away for some time.The Solar Trade Association said the move was a blow to the industry, and it was wrong the government had made the decision before setting out its new plans.The change is one of a double whammy for solar power in the UK, with energy regulator Ofgem also announcing measures on Tuesday that will see solar households pay more for their energy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0380d6c51c1540441962cc95c48e3dd3f1e8622b/0_163_4960_2975/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bfaeb6a805cf05f3e904993923a53f0","title":"brexit britain westminster leave remain may corbyn","story":"The ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs and sealed them in pyramids. Russian revolutionaries pickled Lenin and displayed him in a mausoleum on Red Square, where he lies to this day. Now Brexit Britain has taken that macabre tradition to the next level, embalming its leader while she is still alive. A waxen Theresa May is entombed in office, still performing basic functions of a prime minister although the last animating breath of her authority has expired.To survive a confidence vote among Conservative MPs last week, May promised not to lead her party into a general election. The result of the ballot was still close enough to be perfectly disabling. She won enough support to continue as leader, but not enough to regain control of the agenda. An astringent European summit then bleached away hope of improvements to her Brexit deal. That document, like its sponsor, is trapped in parliamentary limbo.Labour ambivalence over Brexit is another chemical element in the embalming fluid. Jeremy Corbyn’s motion to censure the prime minister, tabled on Monday night, was a deliberately futile gesture. It avoided the specific wording required by law for a no-confidence vote to count as a trigger for bringing down a government. That meant May could ignore it. Corbyn is not ready to pull the proper no-confidence trigger because he expects the mechanism would misfire. A general election would then be ruled out, forcing the Labour leader to declare what he wants to happen next. And he doesn’t know.Labour’s activist base and a solid chunk of its MPs want a referendum. The shadow cabinet is split, and influential voices in the leader’s office insist that Brexit must go ahead, partly in fulfilment of hard‑left Eurosceptic doctrine and partly in the belief that Corbyn’s best route to No 10 passes through leave-voting constituencies.It is true that May would pass a Commons test of confidence. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hardline Brexiteer groupuscule has said it would back her, despite orchestrating the failed putsch only a week ago. (So Rees-Mogg and friends think May is not good enough to lead their party but is still adequate enough as a prime minister for the rest of us.)That leaves parliament sliding towards the Christmas recess in a state of presumed confidence in May and presumed rejection of her Brexit deal, but without either proposition having been tested in the voting lobbies. Meanwhile, the leaders of the two main English parties are running out of ways to look busy when in fact they are just biding their time. Various factions of their parties clamour around them competing for attention, offering alleged routes out of the impasse. It is like watching owners trying to coax a pair of cats down from a tree, knowing they are stranded even when they show little sign of wanting to be rescued.Parliamentary deadlock reflects irreconcilable isions in the country, which could, I suppose, be celebrated as representative democracy in action. But the stalemate also exposes a different tension – between the whole Brexit process and the Westminster party system. Leave and remain opinion is not conveniently distributed between government and opposition, yet MPs are used to seeing issues in terms of neatly arranged rows of benches facing each other across the Commons floor. Everyone is struggling to map a new political geography of the chamber where, on the biggest issue, pro-European Tory cabinet ministers are closer in natural sympathy with Labour backbenchers than either group is with its own leader.One attempt to navigate this strange terrain brought a delegation of Labour MPs into Downing Street last week to meet David Lidington, cabinet office minister (effectively May’s deputy) and Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s chief of staff. The encounter was denounced by Tory Brexiteers as a treasonous plot to arrange a referendum. Accounts I have heard of the meeting sound a lot more circumspect than that. May’s lieutenants are far from enthusiastic about a plebiscite. But they also need a sense of where the numbers in parliament are on various plan B ideas, and how well thought-through those plans are. As one pro-referendum MP puts it: “They have this Brexit mess tangled around their legs, and they just want to be free of it.”Corbyn can probably relate to that. He is also tangled in European questions that interest him little and put an emotional barrier between him and his fan base. He wants to get across the turbulent Brexit water to a safer shore where familiar campaigns on austerity and the NHS can resume. But how?On that question, John McDonnell is a key figure. The shadow chancellor has no affection for the EU, but he is also alert to the role that remainers will play in any pro-Corbyn electoral coalition. Above all, he craves power and seems at least open to persuasion that a referendum, which would split the Tories and energise Labour activists, could get him there.Neither May nor Corbyn want to be the one to say aloud that the best package available from the menu of EU relationships is the one labelled full membership. It is a little easier for the Labour leader, but he still needs a ladder to climb down with dignity from past assertions that the 2016 result is irreversible. That ladder might be a formal consultation with Labour members. Corbyn’s licence to U-turn comes in an envelope labelled “party democracy”. The climbdown is harder for May, but she could yield to parliamentary pressure for a referendum. As long as her deal is then on the ballot paper, she can truthfully say she never stopped believing in Brexit.Those scenarios depend on the meaningful vote being held and lost – and, for now, the prime minister insists it can be won. Unlikely, but not impossible. The more discussion there is of no Brexit and no deal, the more middle-ground Tories find things to like about May’s withdrawal agreement. It bundles Britain into a miserable tunnel of endless negotiation with Brussels, but many Conservative MPs would swallow that pill just to get out of the current mess without a referendum. So would a few Labour ones.The blurring of party lines makes the coming weeks especially hard to predict. The options cannot all be branded in red or blue colours. In the country, leave and remain identity are superseding traditional Labour and Tory loyalties. In parliament, the whips are clueless. Neither May nor Corbyn is capable of dictating a position to their MPs. They look more like passive objects of lobbying and manoeuvring.Politics is now driven by informal Commons coalitions trying to beat paths for the so-called leaders to follow. Whatever happens in 2019, wherever Britain ends up in its relations with Europe, 2018 will be remembered as the year that Brexit fought the old Westminster party system – and won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a0cd04a5501653d90a9b22088cd3e6e09c4ed8/0_221_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13151aeecaaf18e349e1dd40c652179d","title":"managed no deal brexit","story":"Businesses are being told to prepare for something ministers see as only a negotiating tactic. This moral blackmail could spiral out of controlIt’s getting so predictable, you could almost set your watch by it. Whenever this government has run out of other ideas on Brexit, it summons the hoary old ghost of no deal to frighten the children. And so once again this morning, cabinet has been summoned to discuss the merits of what the ardently pro-leave Penny Mordaunt calls a “managed glide path” out of the EU, which as a euphemism for crashing a plane into the side of a mountain beats even Labour’s “jobs-first Brexit”. Someone briefs the Sun that all other government business will be parked, all the better to concentrate on adopting the brace position. The perennially loyal health secretary, Matt Hancock, is wheeled out to insist earnestly that the NHS is prepared for no deal now, which may come as a surprise to anyone working in the NHS, and so should everyone else be.And the response in Westminster will largely be: oh please, not this again. Not another crude attempt either to scare MPs into voting for Theresa May’s essentially defunct deal, or to scare the EU into offering more concessions, or preferably both. Downing Street has itself all but admitted that the idea of a carefully stage-managed no-deal is a non-starter, given the EU has said it won’t even open discussions about such a thing until after we leave, and it beggars belief that May is seriously just planning to wing it. So presumably businesses too are meant to understand that ministers don’t really mean it, except as a negotiating tactic.Yet what makes this form of moral blackmail so wickedly irresponsible is that it risks spiralling out of the government’s control. There is only so long employers can hold off from activating contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit when the government is very loudly and clearly signalling that they should do so, with ministers asked to approve letters to thousands of businesses urging them to plan harder for no deal. And once those decisions are made, they can’t be unmade. Headquarters cannot be moved back to Britain on a whim, and jobs cannot be reinstated. Sales lost because customers get jittery and put off making major purchases won’t be so easily recouped, either. Nor can we unspend the billions government departments are being ordered to spend on planning for something most of Whitehall still thinks would be madness, at the expense of domestic problems crying out for attention. (There is something deeply odd about a pro-remain chancellor demanding to know why ministers have spent only a third of the pot set aside for no-deal preparations, when the obvious answer is that they think there are better uses for public money than spraying it around on something they still can’t quite believe will be allowed to happen.)Technically speaking, it’s still not too late for all the major parties to agree that they could not in all good conscience allow a no-deal Brexit to befall the country. That would clear the way for a decision on the only realistic options left: May’s deal, revoking article 50, or somehow trying to open negotiations on an alternative deal (the last two of which would probably require a second referendum or a general election first, and the final one of which probably requires some sort of miracle).But giving up the ridiculous pretence that no deal is a workable outcome doesn’t suit May, because it would expose her to the full wrath of leavers within her party. More curiously it doesn’t suit Jeremy Corbyn all that well either, since any narrowing down of the choices forces the opposition leader closer to the point of actually choosing something. This empty threat fools nobody, yet seemingly cannot be withdrawn, and thus has begun to take on a life of its own. And all the time parliament inches closer to the thing that almost nobody wants, but almost everyone seems powerless to stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbcbc3d92c76e643e5c70e77fc83f722543915d8/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8976ca8f10d59524854d3657dae0a3b8 1290w","title":"what stopped you applying to oxbridge","story":"New research from the Sutton Trust has shown that high-flying pupils from state schools are far less likely to apply to Oxbridge than their peers in the private sector and, if they do apply, are less likely to be successful. We asked talented A-level students what stopped them applying.“I have never lived anywhere but London. I went to an inner-city state school and was predicted 3 A*s at A-level, but I did not even look at the courses at Oxford and Cambridge. No one from my school has ever got into Oxbridge and I didn’t think I would have as much in common with Oxbridge students as with other students in London. People who get into Oxbridge are a different type of people to me and my friends.“I looked at the league tables and went for UCL because it was third for medicine after Oxford and Cambridge and it was in London. By staying here, I can still see my old friends and live with my parents. I feel very comfortable in London and, although it’s hard work, I’m really enjoying my course at UCL.”20, second-year anthropology student, University of London“I chose not to apply to Oxbridge for several reasons. Firstly, the lack of a dedicated anthropology degree for undergraduates. I did the international baccalaureate and had already been studying anthropology, so the Cambridge course felt like a step backwards. It seemed to me it would be years before I got to do anything meaty and current.“Secondly, although my predicted IB grades were just high enough to get in, I felt the requirements were extortionate compared to what is required of A-level students, and it would have added a lot of pressure on me during exams.“I saw friends of mine go to Cambridge and drop out – one was the smartest person I knew. The culture comes across as very competitive. A lot of people from private schools get in and I was concerned there would be an echo-chamber effect in tutorials – I think if you are studying things like culture and ersity in an anthropological context, you need different perspectives. Living in college halls for three years would only exacerbate that problem because I wouldn’t interact with anybody outside of the academic sphere.“Finally, the ideals at Oxbridge do not line up with my own. I think it is very much about maintaining the status quo. I didn’t like the elitist undertones among the privately educated students at the open days. I wanted to be somewhere that wasn’t full of Tories.”“I’m from a low-income household. I went to an inner-city London state school and got A*A A at A-level. I was tutored by an Oxford academic for an hour a week thanks to the Access Project, a scheme that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds get places at top universities. My tutor really tried to get me to apply to Oxford and offered to help with my application, but I refused. I didn’t know anyone in my social circle who wanted to go there.“I spent a week at a Cambridge summer school and went to the Oxbridge open days, but most students were white and many went to private schools. They would talk about owning a house in France and going skiing every year. They knew nothing about growing up on an estate and going to a state school. It made me feel isolated. “Then, when I looked at the staff, I didn’t see much ersity. I worried I would encounter unconscious racial bias. I didn’t want to spend three years in a place where I couldn’t connect with anyone, where I had no shared experiences.“I might have looked past that if my course, English, hadn’t seemed so white-centric and European. I would have been reading a lot of literature by old dead white men. I wasn’t happy about getting thousands of pounds in debt to study something I felt I wouldn’t relate to. My modules at King’s College London are more erse, allowing me to study texts from a range of cultures and time periods, which I find inspiring.”19, first-year philosophy and theology student, Durham University“I grew up in a mining town in Northumberland and went to a state school in special measures. I was predicted A* A* A and my teachers greatly encouraged me to apply to Oxbridge but the scope of the course was limited, which meant missing out on aspects of philosophy that greatly interested me. “Also, when I visited, Cambridge didn’t seem like the sort of place where working-class people often get in. At open days, your options if you need help with funding aren’t pushed like at Durham. At Durham, applicants from low-income families who attend state schools with low progression rates to university can write an essay, and if you pass you get offered slightly lower entry grades and a bursary. I got offered a £2,000 annual bursary, which was really, really helpful. If any similar schemes exist at Oxbridge, I wasn’t made aware of them. “My father, a single dad, would have sold a lung to help me financially if I had wanted to go to Oxbridge, but I couldn’t turn down the Durham bursary, especially when the course was so much more appealing. I love studying at Durham.”* Not his real name"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b855325a8f49747c2cef517fc7901887083d01/0_246_4241_2546/master/4241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fe3f9a705e9b8173027056493f07597","title":"turning wilderness into theme parks the great national parks debate","story":"Governments hail nature-based tourism as a win-win but conservationists say Australia’s wild places belong to everyone and shouldn’t be sold outThe development planned for Cradle Mountain in Tasmania’s north-west is arguably the most high profile example of the dilemma faced by governments dealing with the growing popularity of nature-based tourism in national parks.In May this year, in the midst of a byelection, the federal government tipped in $30m to make the most controversial part of the plan a reality: visitors will soon be able to arrive at Dove Lake in minutes using a cable car instead of taking a shuttle bus.At the Dove Lake viewing platform, they will not even need to step outdoors to take the obligatory selfie in front of one of Tasmania’s most beautiful views.The project has been described as a game changer by local politicians.“The benefits are enormous, whether it is the hotel occupancy, whether it is the service industry, and economic stimulator will be an understatement for what this will do for the region of Tasmania.”But environmental groups says it marks a serious erosion of the wilderness experience for which Cradle Mountain became famous.Greens senator Nick McKim says: “This is $30m to prop up a corporate business model and turn wilderness areas into theme parks.“Tasmania’s wild places are owned by everyone. They shouldn’t be sold out.”The issue of whether national parks are primarily about protecting bioersity and fragile ecosystems or whether other activities and tourism can coexist is a perennial debate.Sometimes it’s possible to achieve both. But with growing tourism numbers and state governments in search of ways to boost their economies and make national parks earn a return, the conflicts are becoming more stark and frequent.In Tasmania, the Hodgman government launched an expressions of interest process after it won government in 2014 that has so far solicited 47 proposals for development in the state’s national parks. Twelve leases or licences have already been granted, 22 have been received under the second stage of the proposals and 17 are under assessment.“The Tasmanian government has a goal to transform Tasmania into the environmental tourism capital of the world, to create jobs in Tasmania and help reach a target of 1.5 million interstate and international visitors a year by 2020,” it says.But the development push has horrified the Wilderness Society.“The government goes about harvesting ideas from the marketplace, then runs them through a closed-door process and then goes about dismantling the protections on wilderness areas to allow them to happen” says Vica Bayley, Tasmanian campaign manager.He says the process of assessing these projects is highly secretive and does not appear to take into consideration the way it will change remote wilderness areas.One of the most controversial projects is planned for the world heritage-listed Halls Island in Lake Malbena, a “luxury standing camp” that will include fly-in fly-out helicopter access.“It has been approved against the expert advice of the government’s own statutory advisory body,” says Bayley. “Lake Malbena is in a remote, high-value wilderness area much loved by bushwalkers and fly fishers. Wilderness is wild country that is in a natural state and remote from settlement or points of mechanised access,” he says.Bayley says the helicopter flights will shatter the wilderness experience.The Wilderness Society has lodged federal court action to overturn a federal government approval which was required because it was in a world heritage area.Yet, despite the criticisms, the new facilities are proving popular.The state government has opened the Three Capes track, charging $495 for the four daythree night walk. Walkers stay in very comfortable huts, owned by the parks service. Or there is a more exclusive, privately owned option charging more than $2,000 to stay in private lodges, fully catered.The new facilities have opened up the park to a whole new audience that might have balked at camping.The Three Capes track has proved so popular that the Hodgman government is considering many more new projects in national parks and has asked the private sector to pitch ideas.New hut-based walk sites under consideration include Freycinet peninsula, Southwest conservation area, the Walls of Jerusalem and the Tarkine national park. These areas are currently only accessible by camping, though some tour companies already offer supported walks with base camps and catering.The idea of luxury walking seems to have made its way northward, with the Queensland government currently running a similar expression of interest process for three walks in its national parks that will include accommodation.These are in Hinchinbrook national park (along the Thorsburn trail) , the Whitsundays and at Cooloola in the Great Sandy national park.But critics say the Queensland department of natural resources, mines and energy has a chequered record in managing the leases it grants in national parks, often for 60 years, and that operators are allowed to routinely breach them without consequences.They point to the crumbling eco-resort at Cape Richards in Hinchinbrook national park that has sat in ruins for the best part of a decade.The resort, once known as Hinchinbrook Island wilderness lodge, closed in 2010 after being damaged by cyclone Yasi and was destroyed by fire in 2015. It is now being gradually consumed by nature.A Western Australian businessman, Adam Tree, has offered to rebuild it as a glamping resort, but has been hamstrung by the department’s insistence he pick up the $800,000 owing on the lease.“There is endless duck-shoving over these leases,” says Cairns-based environmentalist, Bill Sokolich.“The primary purpose of these places is conservation. The Newman government changed it to ‘recreation’. The ALP promised to reinstate the cardinal principle, but then added ‘conservation and tourism’,” he says.The commonwealth is also getting in on the tourism in national parks trend. Last year it approved Swell Lodge, a luxury eco-lodge in the rainforest of Christmas Island, one of the six national parks it manages.The first solar-powered chalet in Swell Lodge opened in July this year and another seven are planned.But the development will place tourists in the path of an annual crab migration, an event described by Sir David Attenborough as one of the 10 greatest natural wonders on earth.During the annual migration, tourists will have to walk rather than drive into the monsoonal rainforest to reach their five-star clifftop chalets when the ­island is carpeted with red crabs on their way to the sea to lay eggs.The federal government has signalled it is ready to allow more development inside its parks which also include Booderee national park at Jervis Bay, Kakadu in the Northern Territory, Uluru, Norfolk island and Pulu Keeling island.In theory this could make some of these areas more accessible, but there is always the risk that, in pursuit of dollars, the development will favour high-end resorts available only to the very few.New South Wales has had long experience of trying to balance tourism development in the form of several ski resorts, with management of a fragile environment in Kosciuszko national park.The latest flashpoint has been the issue of brumby culls and whether the horses, revered in Banjo Patterson poems, should be afforded heritage status.Despite expert reports recommending continued culls, the horse-riding community has triumphed with the Berejiklian government.The other flashpoint has been commercialisation of existing structures within parks such as Sydney Harbour national parks.“In the name of revenue-raising, New South Wales Parks and Wilderness Service invites hire of buildings and locations in Sydney Harbour national park and other national parks as being available for weddings, corporate Christmas parties, and other functions,” says Park Watch’s coordinator Carolyn Pettigrew.“There is even a policy for dance parties,” she says. “Just how dance parties and weddings fit with the aims of the NPW (national parks and wildlife) act defies logic.“Public land is being offered, excluding others, to those who can afford to pay. There is something seriously wrong with this policy.“Tourism also requires the attention of parks staff, leaving them with little time to undertake conservation activities. With pressures on parks budgets and staff cuts, the problem has become acute in some NSW parks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ad9f6bf9b5ff09e1e8d143d71a1eea0ffc7080/0_0_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb1569c2d44e7932338569cb1a251643","title":"drab to fab six ways christmas party ready hair clips matt red lipstick sparkly socks festive fast","story":"Statement hair clips, matt red lipstick and sparkly socks – how to transform an everyday outfit into something festive, fastParty season is reaching its peak but you’re all out of jazzy wardrobe ideas – sound familiar?

In 2013, Magimix found it was at this point, after an average four-and-a-half hours of cooking, that, as frazzled hosts start to bring the dinner together, once happy homes from Aberdeen to Hastings kick-off like Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. It need not be like this. Not if we all respect some basic rules about how to do Christmas dinner right. Read on and merry Christmas … hopefully.“Come on,” you say. “It’ll be great.” It won’t. Your hassle-free Christmas dinner means choosing from a set menu of high-profit, easy-to-serve dishes seasoned with the salty tears of bitter, orced chefs and served by disengaged young staff only here because of student debt. It is £50 a head to eat in a ropey chain pub, north of £200 to go “posh”. Everyone will hate you for it.Do not passive-aggressively announce you are “doing” Christmas, regardless of how inconvenient it is for everyone to drive, sleep over or cram into your flat. It is their Christmas, too.Whether that be on smoked salmon and champagne or a whole Cadbury’s selection box (because Christmas), make sure it is in good time. It is demoralising for hosts when bloated guests arrive protesting they are not hungry.On Christmas Day you are free, if not obligated, to get on it early. A poll commissioned by the ginmakers Mason’s reports that we start drinking on average at 11.54am, which is hugely beneficial to our collective enjoyment of the day. Hungover? Hoist yourself out of that despondency. Love Christmas? A nip will heighten your excitement. Despise this forced jollity? Magically, alcohol will make it tolerable, and you tolerable to other people.On Christmas Day, social media is a wasteland populated by tragic stragglers wishing their families “Merry Christmas!” on Twitter (you live with them, just shout upstairs) posing with their gifts on Instagram or posting on Facebook from a sleeping bag in the Boxing Day sales queue outside Next. Staring at a screen on Christmas Day, therefore, is not just rude, it is depressing. The people you love are here IRL. Enjoy them. Failing that, read a book.... with half-hearted offers of help, booze that needs stashing or constant reminders about who won’t eat dark meat or sprouts. It is infuriating.There has been a rash of news stories this year about people charging their families for Christmas dinner. The typical price is £30 a head, prompting one Mumsnet user to declare: “OMG! No! Fuck, that is horrible.” It certainly seems provocative, particularly if, as one couple told the Daily Mail, they price it to turn a profit. However, in an age of rising food costs (last Christmas, the average UK family spent £225 on food and drink), rampant gluttony (we eat on average 6,000 calories on Christmas Day) and soaring expectations (one woman told This Morning she spent £500 feeding her tribe), it raises the question of how we should share the financial burden. Money need not change hands. Instead, in a sensitively Marxist way (“To each according to need, from each according to ability”), a list of shopping and jobs (veg prep, bringing dessert etc) should be split among the party. Broadly, guests can then spend as much time or money as they wish on their tasks. The host must start a WhatsApp group to coordinate this now obligatory in building anticipation before any event. Accept the tsunami of nonessential chat that will ensue. Count to 10. It is Christmas.Confusingly, Christmas dinner is a late lunch, served between 2pm and 3pm. Go into early evening and guests will be too hangry or drunk to appreciate it. Traditionalists will be livid (“Your grandad didn’t vote leave so he could eat Christmas dinner at 7pm, Claire! We’re not French”), as will those who suddenly find that eating clashes with the Strictly Christmas special.Wearing a Christmas party hat is a sign of true maturity. No, it is not cool. You never saw Che Guevara, Ian Curtis or Tupac in a festive titfer, but who are trying to impress? You are eating with your family. They already know you’re a pillock.For one day, after a year of such ision, could we reach beyond politics to find some deeper connection with our kin? Giving it to the in-laws with both barrels won’t make you feel better and will change nothing about Brexit, Trump or Syria.They are the support band here, the B-movie, the Bake Off Extra Slice. You want light dishes, served in modest portions that, from shop-bought paté to jerusalem artichoke velouté, can be brought by guests and served quickly with little fuss. The host will go berserk if you start commandeering kitchen space to prepare a complex winter salad.One type of potato is plenty. Serving mash and roasted spuds takes up precious plate-space better occupied by pigs in blankets. Beyond potatoes, the core Christmas vegetables are commonly acknowledged as sprouts, parsnips and carrots. They offer a clear balance of sweet, mineral and roasted vegetal inflections to the meat. Go beyond that (peas, red cabbage, broccoli, mangetout) and your plate gets very crowded, both literally and in its flavours.Serving everything on sharing platters sounds festive, but it is a fiddly mood-killer. Guests will spend 10 minutes in near silence, shuttling dishes around the table as the food goes cold.Think: a savoury combination of pork, sage, shallots, chestnuts and pancetta. Breadcrumbs, onions and herbs do not a stuffing make. Serve one of those monstrosities dominated by booze-soaked fruits and your guests will be justified in mutinying.The receptacle is irrelevant. The age of the gravy boat has sailed a measuring jug will do. Just keep it coming. It is all gravy, literally.This is not Sunday dinner, they only really go with beef and the host is frantic.From mulled wine and bread sauce to Christmas pudding, there are many heavy, egregiously spiced festive foods created for Victorian palates that contemporary Britons find revolting. A minority of self-appointed keepers of the Christmas spirit take that revulsion as a personal insult, as if declining an eggnog is Grinch-like subversion. No. It is just a vile drink.As host, you may still be stuffed, but you cannot neglect that cheeseboard or first leftovers sandwich. For many, it is more exciting than Christmas dinner itself.

Solskjaer had an unsuccessful Premier League stint with Cardiff in 2014.Mourinho’s sacking, conducted face-to-face at Carrington on Tuesday morning by Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, followed Sunday’s defeat at Liverpool and ended a tenure that began in May 2016. United finally lost patience with a manager who was not adhering to the club’s core attacking values and who had overseen their worst start to a campaign for 28 years.The club took into account Mourinho’s transfer spend of around £400m on 11 players who, it is understood, the club insist were all the Portuguese’s choice. In addition to the disquiet regarding the side’s stultifying style, there was further disappointment at Mourinho’s development and improvement of United’s younger players. The club also considered the growing unhappiness from fans at the direction of the club under him. It is understood the compensation due to Mourinho will be no more than £15m.Mourinho is said to have been taken by surprise at his dismissal, having fully expected to continue for the game at Cardiff on Saturday. An indication of his mood was given when his confidant Eládio Paramés tweeted in Portuguese: “Moyes did not fit, Van Gaal did not fit, Mourinho did not fit. The only one that fits is Ed Woodward. Do you understand?” Mourinho is said to want to continue in club management.A poor start to the Premier League season has seen United slip 19 points behind the leaders, Liverpool, and fall off the pace in the hunt for a top-four place. They have won only once in six league matches, drawing during that sequence with struggling Southampton and Crystal Palace.The club issued a statement on Tuesday morning which read: “Manchester United announces that manager José Mourinho has left the club with immediate effect.“The club would like to thank José for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future. A new caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the current season, while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager.”In two full seasons at Old Trafford, Mourinho won the Europa League and League Cup (2016-17) before finishing second in the Premier League last season and reaching the FA Cup final. In that period since replacing Louis van Gaal, United’s spending stands at £364.3m on eight buys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b75c4c32d80886aedbd4d21491cc63382e9e9a/0_2_1948_1169/master/1948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bc303bab1a258e040cbc35f552fa043","title":"jose mourinho manchester united loveless celebrity marriage","story":"Farewell, then, José. It’s been fun. Or if not exactly fun then fitful, tedious and wreathed in a familiar sense of entropy. Either way José Mourinho’s abrupt departure from Manchester United on Tuesday morning completes a familiar three-year cycle of doomed hope, doomed decline and, by the end, simply doom.There was at least an inevitability about the end. It has been clear since the summer that Mourinho was preparing for this moment, using his public pronouncements to shift blame, distance himself from the squad of players assembled, and tend to the one element that really matters: his glorious but increasingly distant legacy.In the event, United’s struggles through the autumn proved irresistible. Mourinho himself has seemed to be fraying a little in recent weeks, resembling in his post-match interviews a particularly haggard and doomed minor European aristocrat hurled up against the palace wall by a cabal of Bolsheviks and asked to explain his extravagant misuse of the public purse.But then, let’s face it, the glorious red dawn of José Mourinho was only ever a chimera, someone else’s misguided daydream. At times José in Manchester has felt like a loveless celebrity marriage, two fading stars of the last decade clinging to one another in the hope of some mutual rekindling, a Queen reunion tour fronted by Rick Astley.And so here we go again, glancing around the jerry-built structures of another doomed post-Ferguson era. There will of course be an immediate urge to pile in on Mourinho, to attach all blame to the manager. This is the easiest, and indeed most attractive option. It is also the option Manchester United’s directors and owners would much prefer.This is in part why football managers exist. One of the key functions of the first ever managers was to stand out front and assuage the ire of the Victorian crowds, straw men hoist into place to create a layer of padding between angry customers and the keepers of this fevered new form of public entertainment.Not that Mourinho doesn’t deserve his share. At United he failed in the most basic task of creating a coherent high-level football team out of the payers at his disposal. Indeed, it is hardly controversial to suggest Mourinho is basically done at this level, that his methods and his persona simply seem out of time.There will always be a place for defensive or “reactive” football. Mourinho’s deep block, the idea of crouching behind your guard and letting an opponent punch itself out, has given him some of his finest moments. But nobody really plays like this any more at the top end. Even nihilistic team defence has moved on and left Mourinho behind, becoming more complex and nuanced in other hands.Plus there has always been a basic paradox in Mourinho’s presence at Real Madrid and Manchester United, club football grandees with a certain romantic entitlement about their own style, their own way of winning. Here is a manager who got so good at coaching underdog teams that he got to coach the overdog teams, employed by clubs where his strangulating methods no longer hit the right note.Along the way his key early superpower, the ability to inspire undying loyalty in his star players, has been replaced by constant gripes about the youth of today. Mourinho has become managerial gammon, bleating on about the snowflakes and millennial narcissists, these kids with telephones and haircuts. Which is all very well. But Frank Lampard has retired. And while Paul Pogba may have plenty lacking in his game, he is also what you’ve got, José old boy.In the end his failings at United were prosaic and even quite dull. Mourinho was unable to coach greater solidity into some average but serviceable defenders. As a result he never trusted his most skilful players, never conceived any workable set of attacking rhythms against stronger opponents. Worse, he just seemed to lose heart, to lose the basic fun of inspiring players and building the vital units of a team. By the end United had become something they can’t be, not just a poor team but a boring one, trapped within their own muscular limitations.Not that anybody really needs to say any of this. We have been here before. There is little to be gained by flogging at the Mourinho-shaped piñata. In the end the most startling thing about the sacking of José Mourinho by Manchester United is still the appointment of José Mourinho at Manchester United in the first place.The 30 months since tell us a great deal more about United’s current state. It is easy enough to suggest what United really need is not a new manager but new owners, or at least owners who don’t see this great sporting institution as just another business to be wrung out and stripped down, squatting upon its noble old shoulders like vampiric corporate homunculi.Look closely enough and football club owners are often a wretched spectacle. But what is most striking here is the lack of expertise and basic care in the grass-based football facing side of the business. It is here that strange feeling of emptiness starts to creep in. Just enough is being done, corners cut, funds directed elsewhere. At the very least United require a coherent structure in place to fill that vacuum around the manager, a director of football to provide a layer of ballast between football and marketing departments.There is no coherence to United’s recruitment, style of play or managerial succession. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho: what do these people actually have in common? Those with first-hand experience wince over the scouting and coaching structures. Even the stadium is starting to rattle a little compared with the best around Europe.There is still a remarkable quality of deathlessness to the United brand, marching off around the world like a red and black zombie army. But how much longer can this momentum sustain itself?Above all in the dog days of the José era this has felt like a club without direction, but also without love, without warmth, without someone in there taking absolute care over the details of what actually happens on the pitch. Mourinho may have gone. But it will take a great deal more hand-wringing, a great deal more leverage to shift the people who put him in place, and who remain at the rusting wheel of this grand old sporting supertanker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b04adb6cf75421df676ff80a3a53a3644c26c67/0_90_3245_1947/master/3245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=276552b90d355c2ed6c8cc068f0fdc80","title":"manchester united paul pogba next permanent manager transfers","story":" Resolve the Paul Pogba situationThe last thing a new manager needs is to walk into a isive disagreement between the club and its most expensive acquisition. José Mourinho’s adversarial habit of picking fights with key members of staff is not for everyone and his replacement will have to find out quickly whether the United dressing room is a happy place. It has frequently been suggested that Pogba’s apparent restlessness is down to a personality clash with the manager, in which case the air should be cleared now and United could, in theory, find themselves virtually with a new player on their hands. On the other hand it is possible that Pogba wants away regardless, which would make it sensible to sell him in January and try to recoup at least some of the club’s losses. Pogba has rarely been seen at his exciting best since rejoining United for £89m in 2016. It might be a challenge too far, amid all the other challenges facing the next permanent United manager, to retrieve an awkward relationship at this late stage.Mourinho spent most of the past year moaning about his club’s inactivity or indecisiveness in the transfer market. The club did not do quite so much moaning, but let it be known that they had given their manager sufficient backing, and it was no one’s fault but Mourinho’s if the players he had brought in at considerable expense were no longer considered suitable. There is some merit on both sides of this argument, though it is a long way from the template that brought United success. In the later years of Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign, all the big decisions over scouting and player recruitment went through the same office and were meticulously checked and ratified by a bona fide football expert with a lifetime’s experience in professional football, Ferguson himself. Small wonder United are finding that level of knowhow and hands-on experience hard to replace but it has been clear for some time that Ed Woodward and his manager of the moment are not the answer. When Pep Guardiola is asked about recruitment he smiles and says it is out of his hands, safe in the knowledge that when he asked for three full-backs they duly arrived to order. United might never be able to match that expense or efficiency, but any sort of transfer continuity would be an improvement on what is presently haphazard.This might come as a shock to United and their supporters, but things have moved on since the time when the all-conquering Reds could scoop in the best players with little more than a phone call and a promised pay rise. Manchester City and Liverpool are doing that now, while other clubs, most notably Tottenham, are reaping the rewards of intelligent sourcing and managerial stability. United have spent the post-Ferguson years not knowing which course to pursue. Their three managers since 2013 have been very different, as have been their respective recruitment policies. David Moyes found it hard to pull off major signings, Louis van Gaal played it too safe, Mourinho tried to make statements but frequently saw them blow up in his face. As a result big-name players such as Ángel Di María, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Radamel Falcao have been brought in and moved quickly out, with Paul Pogba, Alexis Sánchez and quite possibly Fred in danger of the same fate. Arguably the most successful bit of business United have conducted since Ferguson stepped down was paying over the odds for Marouane Fellaini, which was not something anyone was saying or predicting at the time. Self-evidently that is not a recipe for success or progress, and it comes with the added disadvantage of being wildly and wastefully expensive. United need to be wary of a manager demanding only ready-made players, because experience has shown that the best ones go elsewhere. For perhaps the first time since Ferguson retired United need to heed one of his catchphrases and properly start looking for value in the market.Few would dispute that United’s No 1 asset at the moment is David de Gea, who has just had a contract extension activated to guarantee at least one more season at Old Trafford. After that De Gea will probably review his options and who can blame him? Does a world-class goalkeeper really need to be playing behind a shifting backline that occasionally includes Phil Jones, Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling or does he look at last year’s Champions League finalists and envy goalkeepers screened by Sergio Ramos or Virgil van Dijk? After all the money United have spent, can it really be that they are persisting with Ashley Young at left-back? Mourinho was fond of accusing City of buying four full-backs at once to illustrate the sort of financial might he was up against, but it is not all about money. Man of the match at Anfield on Sunday in the abject defeat that probably cost Mourinho his job, was Andy Robertson, the Liverpool left-back signed for £8m from Hull City. When United won the treble in 1999 their left-back was Denis Irwin, signed for £625,000 from Oldham. Joe Royle referred to that deal as a robbery for years afterwards, but Ferguson not only knew something about football economics, he knew how to put a team together.Mourinho was said to have privately felt that the United squad was not good enough, the training ground was not good enough and the club’s drive and ambition in terms of ownership and leadership left plenty to be desired as well. Plainly Manchester was not good enough either, since Mourinho would only commit to living out of a hotel. All of which makes it appear that the north-west of England is some sort of hell-hole and that a manager would have to be desperate to take on a beached whale of a club such as United. None of which happens to be true. United may never be able to outspend City but there is no reason why they should find themselves overtaken by Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal. At a time when at least half a dozen English clubs are striving for trophies and competing for the best players United have managed to lose some of their lustre. It happens – it has even happened to United before – but with the right, positive attitude and a sensible acknowledgment of the club’s new place in the overall scheme of things the situation can be retrieved. A little humility is needed, in other words, not just on the part of the manager but also from the support base. The club has some work to do and the rewards might not be immediate. For everyone’s sake it will be better if expectations are not set impossibly high from the start. The glorious past is just that for the foreseeable future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26de2af26f4f665017bd9709f0b317311ab12e7e/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5c76fca0eac71a20337b0e5b13e88f0","title":"leicester city v manchester city carabao cup quarter final live","story":"The usual plethora of changes for the League Cup.

But life goes on in Manchester, and as managerless United contemplate their next move, rivals City tonight take on Leicester City at the King Power in the quarter-finals of the League Cup.The hosts hope to make it to the semis for the first time since 1999-2000. But that could prove a big ask. They’ve lost all four of their previous League Cup ties with Manchester City, who beat them at this stage both last season and in 2013-14. They’ll most likely not face a weakened team, either, with Sergio Aguero and Kevin de Bruyne expected to get some sort of run-out on their journeys back from injury. Leicester’s old boy Riyad Mahrez could also play, too.On the flip side, Leicester have yet to concede a goal in this season’s League Cup. And they’ve got history in this competition, having won it in 1964, 1997 and 2000. Can Claude Puel’s side pay homage to the Martin O’Neill years?

United won that game 8-1, having been just 2-1 up at half time.More evidence of just how bad things became under Mourinho this season.More from Jamie Jackson:Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signalled more than a year ago that, despite being in charge of Molde, United was his dream job. “It’s a dream, of course,” he said in November 2017 to United.no (the Manchester United supporters’ club Scandinavia). “You never know what path your career may take. If I do well with Molde for, let’s say five years, then an opportunity may suddenly unfold at some point. That’s a dream I have to be allowed to have, even though it seems quite distant right now.”Of the reception he received from United fans when taking charge of Cardiff City in January 2014 at Old Trafford. “It wasn’t easy to stand there in the dugout as a Cardiff manager when the United fans cheered for me for almost the whole game. But it was like coming home. Old Trafford is home.”Our financial reporter Jasper Jolly has been following developments on the stock market: Investment analysts said investors had reacted positively to United “biting the bullet” and firing Mourinho, after poor performance on the pitch and evident discord in the dressing room had started to threaten the company’s financials.The company has guided the stock market to expect earnings of between £175m and £190m for the year to the end of June 2019. Revenues are expected at between £615m and £630m.The immediate priority for the caretaker management will be to prevent an exodus of players, which could result in costly writedowns on their value, said John Tinker, a financial analyst at US research firm Gabelli. “What you can’t afford at this level is for the toxicity to spread,” he said. United’s share price on the New York Stock Exchange rallied strongly over the summer, buoyed by the performances of Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba, who was a key part of France’s World Cup-winning midfield.Bosses at Manchester United, led by executive vice chairman Ed Woodward, have acted to stem the damage of the worst start to a season in 28 years. The run of bad results contributed to the loss of more than a third of the club’s value, with shares falling as low as $17 in December, after hitting a peak of $27.70 per share in August.The executive team should also focus on investing in its academy and bringing players through to the senior team, said Tinker. The academy programme costs around £2m per year, compared to more than £400m in spending on players under Mourinho, including a then world record £89m on Pogba.But analysts at Deutsche Bank, in a note written before Mourinho’s departure, have highlighted the continued strength of Manchester United, which earns almost half its revenues from commercial operations, including sponsorships and brand licensing, on multi-year contracts. Some good news for the next Manchester United manager. There will be no replays in the fifth round of the FA Cup this season, a development that is designed to reduce fixture congestion for the top six, who are all still in Europe. Yes, I’m as surprised as you are. Manchester United are in the top six.Geoffrey Goff makes a good point in this email:Paul, why don’t we look outside the usual suspects? Pochettino would be a great fit but, as someone else has already pointed out, why would he want to go to Old Trafford? Shedloads of money might help, but I think he’s more likely to end up at Real Madrid in any case.So, why not take a look at Lucien Favre, the manager of Borussia Dortmund, currently topping the Bundesliga with what Wikipedia describes as “a dynamic, quick and attacking-minded football where ball possession and change of tempo alternate”. Favre is also well known for his ability to develop talented young players and introduce them into the first team. I’d settle for that. He might even be able to bring Jadon Sancho with him.Not everyone in Manchester will be happy to see Mourinho go. The Lowry Hotel have made at least £537,000 from his 895-night stay in the city. He could have bought a big house for that – although spending money hasn’t been his forte in the last few years. Guess what the Fiver is about today?Want to receive our football email every weekday? Sign up here:That contract feels longer by the year.Earlier in the season, when Inter visited Camp Nou in the group stage of the Champions League, we published an article about one of Mourinho’s greatest moments: when he beat Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals and went on to win the treble with Inter. Look at how happy he was in those pictures. Very little of that old fire has been on show this season. José Mourinho signed 11 players as Manchester United manager. The only real success I can see in there is Zlatan, the one who cost nothing.Eric Bailly: £30mZlatan Ibrahimovic: freeHenrikh Mkhitaryan: £30mPaul Pogba: £89mVictor Lindelof: £30.7mRomelu Lukaku: £75mNemanja Matic: £40mAlexis Sanchez: swap with MkhitaryanDiogo Dalot: £19mFred: £52mLee Grant: £1.5mSome sympathy from below the line.He\u0027s not the special one. He\u0027s a very naughty boy. And toxic. I remember his time at Real Madrid. I was living in Barcelona at the time. I don\u0027t know how much his behaviour there was covered in the UK press - the tantrums at press conferences, the waiting in the car park after a match to harrass the referee, poking Barça\u0027s coaching assistant in the eye \u0026amp then pretending he couldn\u0027t even remember the guy\u0027s name. And the results on the pitch were nothing to write home about - just 2 trophies despite all the galácticos \u0026amp we hammered them 5-0. His time is past. No major club needs this idiot on their books. Bye bye, Jose.And some tidy wordplay.The end of an error.Steven Gerrard has also been asked about Mourinho:Big news, but it’s none of my business. He’s obviously a world-class manager. He’s a winner. How can I sit here and say anything bad about José Mourinho? He’s a serial winner.He’s been sacked at Manchester United but he’s won them a couple of trophies. He’s done the best job since Alex Ferguson’s left. He came in and put a couple of trophies in the cabinet. I don’t think you can criticise him too much.It will be interesting to see which direction they go in next. Although none of the Manchester United fans will care what I say about it, so it’s none of my business.It’s hard to believe that just last month José Mourinho was celebrating on the pitch after Manchester United had beaten Juventus in Turin. Where does he go now? Mourinho has looked like a man in need of a rest for some time. Football management – and especially his confrontational style of football management – is a wearying game. Perhaps he should follow Pep Guardiola’s example and take a sabbatical. Guardiola moved to New York for a year and enjoyed the relative anonymity that came from living in Manhattan (on the street where John Lennon was shot). He attended the US Open in Flushing Meadows, went to the Ryder Cup in Chicago and made time for a spot of lunch with Alex Ferguson, but Guardiola’s time in the city was really about stepping back from football for a while. Mourinho looks as if he needs some time away from the game too. Mauricio Pochettino refused to talk about the Manchester United job today but did send his commiserations to Mourinho.“I want to send my best wishes to him. I feel so sorry because you know very well, I have a very good relationship with him. He’s a very good friend and it’s sad news what happened today. It’s not my business what happens in another club. Only I want to send my best wishes to José.”Jürgen Klopp has been speaking about Mourinho today. It was United’s dire 3-1 defeat at Liverpool that proved the final straw for the club’s hierarchy and Klopp reflected: When I met him, he never changed. He’s a very competitive guy, very ambitious, really competitive. He has all my respect, he’s been unbelievably successful. I can imagine in the last few months especially they were not a joy for anybody, especially not for him. It’s not nice that he had to face these questions every day, that’s a problem. But apart from that, nobody can take away all the things he won. I wish personally that he has that in his mind when he leaves and not a few other things that happened in last few months. He’s an outstanding manager, all the rest I have no idea, you have to ask other people.Peter Pollock makes a fair point: “Why would Pochettino go to United? He’s got a settled team ready to move into a fantastic new stadium and a chairman who lets him get on with the job, which he’s very good at.”I think there have definitely been times (last summer perhaps) when Old Trafford would have appealed – but will Pochettino want to walk away when his transitional work is so close to being done?Don’t ask me, ask Paul Campbell, who returns to the hot seat ... now!Here are a couple of nifty charts showing how Mourinho outperformed his predecessors, but fell too far short of his rivals’ high standards.Josh Halliday went to chat with the United fans milling around outside Old Trafford – judging by their comments, Ed Woodward might want to exit via the back door later on.Resolve the Paul Pogba situation, rebuild the defence and put someone, anyone, in charge of transfers. Here’s Paul Wilson on the next United manager’s in-tray:A lot of the talk today has been about who replaces Mourinho – but where will the Portuguese head next after checking out of the Lowry? Early predictions from the bookmakers suggest he could return to Real Madrid or Internazionale, or hold out with his giant payout until the Portugal national team job comes up. Any Chinese Super League club, at a tidy 11-2, looks the best bet to me. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the current favourite to be United’s caretaker manager, it is understood. The 45-year-old is in charge of Molde but as Norway’s season finished in November, he may be free to retain that role and take over United now. What would occur when Molde start their new campaign in March is unclear.Two and a half years can be a long time in football, as illustrated by this gallery. Not so long ago there were fans outside Old Trafford celebrating the fact they had signed Mourinho. It will be interesting to see if the next manager continues to pick Romelu Lukaku. As pointed out by Martin Laurence in this article, the big striker has really struggled this season. He did not have a single shot against Liverpool on Sunday and has taken fewer shots than Virgil van Dijk since the start of October. How about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager until the end of the season? He played for the club for over a decadeHe is responsible for the greatest moment in their historyHe speaks English fluentlyHe has managerial experienceHe is a patron of the supporters’ trust.An email from Abaikoo Mensah:Why is no one considering Arsène Wenger? He has everything United need. Our esteemed football editor Marcus Christenson has selected 10 possible contenders to take over at the end of the season. Diego Simeone would be good fun. Ryan Giggs, whose most recent game as Wales manager ended in a 1-0 defeat to Albania, also makes the list. Incidentally, Giggs was appointed caretaker manager after David Moyes was sacked in 2014.

On learning my salary, the personal finance expert Martin Lewis agreed that this was the case when he saw a day-by-day breakdown of where my money was going, he changed his tune.Lewis told me that I could save enough for a deposit – yes, in London yes, by myself. But first I would have to rein in my senseless spending. I concluded the story a bit shamefaced by his gentle admonishment and resolved to do better. Then my diary was published.The response was immediate and visceral I have never experienced anything like it. In a very long, typewritten letter, a reader told me my fecklessness brought shame on my parents and my editor and warned that, if not addressed, it would cause tension with my future husband and our hypothetical children, culminating, potentially, in my alcoholism. “I have not written this in anger,” she concluded, “but out of serious concern for the way you are wasting your money and your life.”Some people saw their spending reflected in mine, they told me privately. Many more were publicly critical of my £181 haircut (too much), my £1 sausage roll (way too little), and for losing a £20 note on a night out (which I wasn’t thrilled about either). It was later raised in a keynote address on financial education at the University of Edinburgh beneath the heading: “Entitled, spoilt and ridiculous or just youthful play?”Would I have shared so freely had I known what was to come? Maybe not. I had no idea that my personal finance could be taken so personally by so many people. In that regard, I was colossally naive.Money diaries are reliably incendiary on social media – hence their popularity. The , the , Ireland’s TheJournal.ie, Man Repeller and many others regularly publish them, but the site most responsible for popularising them is Refinery29. The lifestyle site now publishes anonymous diaries daily in the US and weekly in the UK, overwhelmingly written by and read by women.Lindsey Stanberry, Refinery29’s work and money director and the editor of the series, says its aim is to give women a space in which to share their experiences and knowledge of personal finance when the social stigma against it perpetuates their financial disadvantage.“Money is still taboo,” she says. “One of the reasons that the wage gap has lingered so long is because women have always been discouraged from talking about it, therefore we lack basic knowledge. Having these conversations isn’t easy, but there’s literal payoff.”It is not just the case that women are systematically paid less than men: they are also less likely to ask for a raise or to invest their savings, and are at greater risk of being impoverished by separation or orce. The Billfold – another US site aimed at women and set on breaking “one of the last taboos in our culture: talking about what you earn” – powerfully set out the stakes in A Story of a Fuck Off Fund, published in January 2016, showing how having savings put away can be the difference between having no choice but to stay in an abusive workplace or relationship and being free to leave.With more to gain from free and frank discussion of personal finance, it is not surprising that women write the majority of money diaries. The catch is, for as long as the taboo exists, they may suffer a personal cost for doing so – especially when a diary goes viral. One published in Grazia last month, about a woman earning £40,000 a year and still receiving cash from her parents, received widespread coverage beneath headlines such as “BANK OF DAD: Woman, 30, slammed as a sponger”, alongside choice quotes of critical online reaction.It is not only diarists deemed by the internet to be irresponsible with money who go viral. Last month, a 22-year-old woman earning $25,000 (£19,700) a month from e-commerce was held up as “your brunch hate read of the day” and “cluelessly braggy” for saving the majority of her earnings each month. Refinery29 also came under fire for showcasing such a wealthy woman, although its own analysis had previously found that while readers request diaries of women with lower salaries, those featuring higher salaries get more clicks.“You have to be a near-perfect human” to escape criticism of your money diary, Stanberry wrote in her address to “all the haters”: “When are women allowed to celebrate their wealth? Is it sexist the way we criticise women for their spending habits? Or when they accept help from family?”In my case, some readers were angry that I was put forward to answer the question: “Can one millennial afford to buy a house?” when I was not representative of my generation, earning considerably more than the median annual salary of £28,677 (although my salary is about in line for London).Regardless of the outcome, they said, the exercise fuelled false narratives that home ownership was purely a question of personal restraint in the same way that those “success stories” profiling young homeowners always play down the deposit gifted by their parents.Which is fair enough. Indeed, nearly a year on, I am more sceptical of Lewis’s final assessment that I could afford a house in London on my own. I had begun the diary exercise knowing that I was not prepared to make home ownership the primary goal of the rest of my 20s and much of my 30s. Nothing Lewis said changed that.Many more readers, however, took umbrage with the cost of my haircut separate to any question of its alleged link to the housing crisis, despite it being one of only two I had all year, and costing far less than, say, a football season ticket or a new iPhone – both purchases that would be wasted on me, which others find to be worth every penny.“Life is just more expensive for women,” says my friend Katie, 29. “We can’t wear the same cheap T-shirt and pair of jeans every day for five years and still be treated with respect.” As the self-described “nosiest person in the world about money”, she is a voracious reader of online money diaries, and has published her own, anonymously.Katie lists, with exasperation, clothes, makeup, skincare and beauty treatments – all to some extent necessary for women to be judged equally presentable and competent as a man. Being transparent about those costs makes painfully clear the double standard, she says. “It is a political act to talk openly about money and everyone should do it and be challenged to do it.”Katie is Australian. In hindsight, I connect the breeziness with which I approached publishing my finances to the fact that I spent more than half my life living there and in New Zealand, where there is less of a social stigma against talking about money than there is in the UK. My female friends and I have regular, frank conversations about our own spending, saving and earning, going back years to the starts of our careers, on the understanding that the knowledge empowers us all.With many of them having successfully negotiated salary increases, it has even brought material benefit. But it is testament to our complex, personal relationship with personal finance that even people who are in favour of transparency, in principle, can find themselves going “all cannibalistic” when faced with it, says Devin Friedman, the editor of the online Wealthsimple Magazine, based in Toronto, Canada.Its Money Diaries series made waves online in the US last month with an American couple’s anonymous, personal account of how they came to be an estimated $360,000 in debt. “A lot of people were really angry about it,” says Friedman. “Like: ‘You’re sending your kids to private school, you’re buying sushi, and you’re complaining that you’re in debt?’” The couple declined to be interviewed for this piece.Friedman points to studies (such as this one) that show money only makes people happier if it improves their social rank to emphasise that it is not a strictly logical matter. “Money has bundled into it such emotional power: resentment, inadequacy, fear, the desire to impress. Sometimes reading about people with privilege acting like they’re not privileged can inspire people to get pissed off.”But everyone is better off understanding money better, Friedman says, whether on a practical level or a human one. “It’s anecdotal evidence, but I think women have made more of a point of being transparent than men have. For men, the social imperative isn’t there.” Friedman says the comedian Maria Bamford and the co-creator of My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Rachel Bloom, felt it was important to give specifics about their income in their interviews for Wealthsimple.So, in the spirit of gender equality, nearly a year since my money diary was published, am I any closer to home ownership?Absolutely – in the same way that if I take a step south-east, I am closer to Australia. But Lewis’s (very obvious) points that I would need savings sometime, and that I would have more the sooner I started, made a strong impression on me. In 11 months, I have saved six weeks’ salary without going into debt – or even cutting down on coffee. The tradeoff has been bringing in my lunch for four weekdays out of five. I hardly notice the difference.I also use Monzo, the millennial-friendly bank, to keep track of my discretionary income, and the savings app Chip. But really, as Lewis said, the biggest shift I had to make was mental. Once I was convinced of the need to save each month, my spending seemed to contract to accommodate it.The fact that I was able to achieve this without significant impact on my lifestyle is more evidence of what was obvious, first to Lewis, then to my irate correspondents: clearly, I had money to burn. I just had to keep a spending diary to realise it myself. I would recommend the exercise, for anyone lucky enough to be merrily oblivious about where their money is going – but maybe not publishing it on the internet. At least, not beneath your name and your email address."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69364055f7f47fb98eb4c951402a70b461960ea/380_642_5469_3281/master/5469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d9cab51c4de30c7302f806a6951db4","title":"a great day in harlem behind art kaness classic 1958 jazz photograph","story":"The young art director’s idea to photograph as many of the luminaries of the New York jazz scene as possible together for Esquire’s 1959 Golden Age of Jazz edition began his career as a photographer.

By  Lyle Jeremy RubinMy first and only war tour took place in Afghanistan in 2010. I was a US Marine lieutenant then, a signals intelligence officer tasked with leading a platoon-size element of 80 to 90 men, spread across an area of operations the size of my home state of Connecticut, in the interception and exploitation of enemy communications. That was the official job description, anyway. The year-long reality consisted of a tangle of rearguard management and frontline supervision.Years before Helmand province, Afghanistan, however, there was Twentynine Palms, California. From the summer of 2006 to the summer of 2007, I was trained as a lance corporal in my military occupational specialty of tactical data systems administration (a specialty I would later jettison after earning my officer commission in 2008). My schoolhouse was the Marine Corps Communication-Electronics School, which was abbreviated as MCCES, pronounced “mick-sess”. For many, the wider location became “Twentynine Stumps” or “the Stumps”. But for me it just became “the Palms”.Our time at the Palms was preceded by three weeks of marine combat training at Camp Geiger, North Carolina, and, before that, 12 weeks of Marine basic training at Parris Island, South Carolina. The progression from Parris Island to Geiger to the Palms signalled, on the face of it, a slow return from barbaric intrigue to the tedium of civilisation. Boot camp was everything you might have gathered from films you’ve seen. There were the recruits on the deck, scrubbing away with their scuzz brushes, like confused termites labouring about impenetrable wood. There were the recruits being called up to the quarterdeck, push-upping or crunching to untold woofs from the mad hats. There were the orders for recruits to hit recruits. There was the rifle drill position that was called the “fag wrist” and the bayonet training that sounded off with “Kill kill kill haji!” (The last bayonet charge occurred during the Korean war.) There was the platoon sergeant who would abruptly emerge in the squad bay frothing, unhinged, and maybe drunk, flipping over everything within spitting distance, propelling recruits to vault off their racks before the whirlwind struck, all while he ranted about every person who had ever wronged him.So not long after my boot-camp graduation, there was also something appropriate about watching junior enlisted men assemble at a weapons expo to get the autograph of the actor R Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket fame. He looked frail and friendly, not at all the drill instructor for whom he had become known. Apart from the obvious irony of active-duty personnel fetishising Stanley Kubrick’s anti-war film – at a weapons expo, no less – the way the Marines lined up for his signature, like excited schoolboys amid the merchandise, struck me as at odds with the myth of the solemn war-fighter set apart from the puerile hustle of American life. I hadn’t abased myself, on my knees, scrubbing toilets at the level and in constant sight of my drill instructor’s crotch just to join a club. That would have been, in the words of Ermey’s Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, “Mickey Mouse shit”.If boot camp had given me a keen awareness of my country’s violence and the overcompensating sentiment that went with it, my experience in school at Twentynine Palms took longer to register. For a while, all I retained was unrelated impressions: a sulphuric stench that would come with the rain, something of which, years later, I would get a second whiff during the wet sand season in Afghanistan, or the sight of meth-heads and tweakers (that’s what we called them) on the public bus I’d take to Walmart where I’d buy items like cheap portable irons or rechargeable Bluetooth headphones. They were alive with death, and their deathliness had an aggression to it, one that burned with a spirited rage.When I think back to their torn visages and beady eyes, I can’t help but wonder how much of my paranoid apprehension of the locals was shaped by private insecurities. Professional-class rearing fused with entry-level military training had made me a nervous wreck. Whether I was outside the gate in the Mojave desert surrounded by what I imagined to be menacing junkies, or outside the wire in Helmand surrounded by what I knew to be poppy farmers, my head was on a swivel, and the countenances of outsiders all took on the same cast. Writing this now, I’m embarrassed by the comparison. There is something ludicrous about relating foot patrols in a combat zone to Bluetooth shopping a few miles beyond a stateside base. But there was a way in which I had been conditioned, before and during my military years, to be suspicious of the outside, wherever that outside might be.When I returned to the Palms for pre-deployment training in 2009, this time as an officer, I was briefed on how best to avoid killing “scrappers” during live-fire exercises. These most dauntless of addicts, along with equally desperate immigrants, would trespass on small arms, artillery and missile impact areas to scrounge for shell casings and other scrap metal they hoped to cash in at recycling centres or hawk on the black market. During the summer, some would expire from thirst. During the winter, some of their already frail bodies would freeze to death. Some would self-detonate with what they had found. Some were chased down, cuffed, and sent to prison, sometimes for years. Some were deported.I didn’t think much of any of this at the time, during either my hurried excursion in 2009 or my extended stay in 2006 and 2007. This was how it was, this is how it had been for a while. Other people around me thought of the region’s lumpenproletariat as lazy and undisciplined, the sort that warranted whatever came their way. In a word made popular during basic training in South Carolina, they were nasty. That they had managed to find themselves in such a grotesquely helpless state made them all the nastier. I’d like to think the cause of my indifference lay elsewhere. In retrospect, I wasn’t so much contemptuous as I was afraid, afraid of what their bare existence said about me and my place in the world. The thought that I had been living at the expense of others had crossed my mind more than once, but to see that cost in the flesh was too much to bear, and so I didn’t think about it.Occasionally I’d hear stories about Marines who were assaulted by resentful townies or desperate transients. The “town”, as a unified organism, was presented as hostile. I recall the station or unit commands issuing warnings and advisories of their own. Avoid X, Y, or Z bar. Do your Q, R, or S activities on base. W area is off-limits during T hours. Perhaps the superciliousness of some of my peers was related to this underlying fear. We were all eager to prove our toughness, yet anxious about having had it easier than the people we saw ourselves being superior to in strength, courage and integrity. That is to say, we were soft, and those we considered losers were hard.At one level, our lack of interest in these people’s plight was to be expected. We didn’t sign up to help the stray or downtrodden. But according to the agitprop or many of our own self-rationalisations, this was precisely what we had volunteered for: we were supposed to be nation builders, culturally sensitive agents of humanitarian intervention, winners of hearts and minds. That we were nothing of the sort, even in relation to our compatriots, did not bode well.Meanwhile, Marines were being discharged dishonourably or on bad conduct. New arrivals each week contained a trickle of female Marines, who promptly became the quarry of at least half the battalion, and their faces tended to undergo a jaded metamorphosis as the weeks progressed. In short, we (and by “we” I mostly mean the men) were acting like a privileged caste. Surrounded by a desert of suffering, we nourished our emotional lives by inflicting suffering on those we cherished or said we cherished. If we weren’t the ones doing the direct inflicting, we at least took our entertainment from the spectacle of other people’s affliction.Pain is weakness leaving the body. Most had internalised this boot-camp mantra, and all had endured some form of arduous labour, torment or sacrifice in the service. The Marines I served with at the Palms hailed from a vast range of backgrounds, although few came from the upper reaches of society. In civilian life, many occupied lower rungs, and many found themselves in similarly oppressive situations on base (especially the women). But in relation to the area addicts and immigrants, we enjoyed our privilege and whatever semblance of narcissistic happiness or gratification it afforded. The political economy of the Palms was treating us better than it was treating them.Then we went to Afghanistan. On that front, I would prefer not to have to say anything at all. The commodification of America’s wars tends to know no bounds. It also happens to be unavoidable for those of us who have taken part in them. I can’t really speak about my past or my politics without risking encouraging, or benefiting from, America’s cheap yet profitable obsession with war.What I will say is that the explosions were regular and the combat was minimal. I was more a spectator than a participant. No matter how close I got, I was always at a remove. I never pulled the trigger, not even in the foot patrol that resulted in my Combat Action Ribbon. Everyone on that patrol was awarded the CAR. Rounds were fired by us and at us, and at one point we were forced to sprint and hit the prone behind some shrubbery. But after the initial fire had subsided and we had been ensconced long enough to feel comfortable, we took photographs of one another with someone’s mobile phone, waiting for the air strike that never came. I still have the photograph of me in the prone, which I later posted on Facebook for the likes. It’s still on Facebook with the likes. A peasant walked toward us from the village we had been gunning down, and I was worried he might be strapped. I tried to be a good officer by ensuring that the farmer was forced to lift up his shawl before approaching us any further. The man casually lifted, and I was ashamed the moment he did. He went about his day and we went back to base.We tried our best to follow in the steps of the men ahead of us, just as we had done on the way out, to minimise the chance of triggering a mine, but we were too thirsty and exhausted at that point to do it right. We were greeted by vehicles and cold bottled water not far beyond the base entrance, and we doused one another as we hopped on the truck beds and let ourselves be escorted back to the headquarter unit’s guarded Shangri-La, where everyone boasted through the evening.During my most frank interludes in Afghanistan, I’d refer to the grotesque mess as the amusement-park ride. There was little amusement for the inhabitants of the villages we were levelling or the tenders of the opium fields we were burning. There wasn’t much amusement for the Marines being hit the hardest either, although they had a tendency to surprise when it came to their capacity to be amused. But for so many, myself included, the point, or one point anyway, was to be amused. The culture has deemed it OK to note that Marines have fun lighting shit on fire, blowing shit up and dodging death. But when you, and especially as a current or former member of the armed services, move from this basic empirical observation to the question of whether the larger enterprise is just and necessary, you violate a taboo.The list of questions never asked is almost infinite: what were the mercenaries I kept meeting truly there for? What about those contractors, specifically in the intel world, who foisted a never-ending line of gadgetries on my men to be field-tested and then shipped off to the global marketplace? Why did the gear never work? Why was it so unwieldy? Why did it slow down ops, and why did no one seem to care that it usually had to be escorted by those with the appropriate clearance, which meant putting my guys at risk from point A to point B and back again? Why so much acceptance in the face of ambitious captains who wanted to be majors, ambitious majors who wanted to be lieutenant colonels, ambitious lieutenant colonels who wanted to be full birds, ambitious full birds who wanted to be generals, and ambitious generals who wanted an extra star, all putting other lives on the line to make it happen?Then one time I watched a group of Marines obliterate the corner of a remote hamlet with the totality of their arsenal, from the M4 carbine to the M249 light machine gun to the M240 machine gun to the MK19 grenade launcher to the AT4 recoilless smooth-bore weapon to the FGM-148 Javelin missile to the BGM-71 TOW missile. They’d lost friends, they were bitter, and they had come to see their surroundings not only as hostile, as was already the case back in Twentynine Palms, but as damnable. They were heading home soon and had some underutilised weapon systems to play with. I took pictures along with everyone else. I told myself there was something I didn’t know that justified the carnage I was consuming.Then there was the time, while pissing on a small outpost before heading off to the next base on a convoy, that I spotted a detainee crouched in a makeshift wooden box not much larger than his crouch. I found the sight wretched enough to jot it down in a notebook, but nothing more. Or the time I was asked to make sure another detainee sharing a back seat with me in an armoured vehicle wasn’t allowed to pull his shawl above his forearms, for fear he would find a way to remove the zip ties from his wrists. I watched the kid, a teenager really, shiver for 15 minutes – it was wintertime in Helmand, and at an altitude of well over 3,000ft, the temperature was near 0C – before relenting and allowing him to cover up. He looked too much like my Marines.Fifteen minutes was a long time to discover the humanity of someone sitting a couple feet to my left. Then again, I had spent over 25 years lapping up a political culture that had erased everything that made him human, so maybe it was more startling that it took only 15. That other provisional detainee cage would likely have failed detainee-treatment regulations at a battalion or regimental base. The razing of that community was easier to accept because we were more than a mile from the shells’ impact. So many of the field and general officers at ision-level headquarters were able to keep congratulating themselves for a job well done because they relied on secondary or tertiary reports from company officers looking to keep their jobs or advance their careers. And if their superiors ever bothered to visit the front, they did so under curated conditions.The locals and vagabonds skirting around my schoolhouse in the southern California desert were almost always, for me and my peers, over there. They were the immiserated background, and the only time we allowed them to come to the fore was when we skittishly passed them while going about our mundane chores – either that, or when they became a problem. When they scuffled with a member of our tribe at a bar or on the street out of resentment, or when they slinked through the perimeter of our impact zones in anguished search of some means of subsistence, they were liable to enter our sights. Some at that point were then chased, rounded up, and maybe even put away.That we never thought it was our responsibility to help them somehow, to serve and protect them, as it were, seems reasonable. It wasn’t our job. However, according to the prognosticators of the postmodern military, working as trustworthy, socially responsible facilitators of a erse and healthy civil society was exactly our job: David Petraeus had told me so in the Counterinsurgency Field Manual, David Kilcullen told me the same thing in The Accidental Guerrilla, as did David Galula in Counterinsurgency Warfare. And everyone serious agreed with the Davids.I’ll never forget the exhilaration in a battalion briefing room as forward-deployed Drug Enforcement Administration operatives crowed about their latest opium raid and burning of poppy fields. And it took a while for these memories to hark back to triumphant newspaper headlines or TV news segments of police swoops on Mojave meth labs. The juxtaposition of the Palms and Helmand is not a perfect fit. Discerning the continuities at all is not something that came easily to me. Too many received wisdoms got in the way. I had been trained my entire life not to connect what, in the course of a slow and painful unlearning I am now so insistent must connect. The gated perimeters, violent ersions and rent faces in the background are not just over there, in the theatre of war. They have come home, or were part of our home to begin with, exported and imported a thousand times over, across the earth. They are borderless, even ubiquitous.Looking over my old emails to family and friends from Afghanistan, I am struck by how little distance I’ve travelled in terms of what I understand. I am still inundated by a torrent of ghastly revelations I can neither fully contain nor channel. I still find available mediums of communication offensive to the task of honest speech. I still intuit something emancipatory about this paralysis. I still adore my Marines just as much as I am beset by our shared past. So much of my daily routine I continue to think of as an act of moral quarantine: still stuck in the Afghan muck, I obsess over my bit in the killing and beseech others to join me in the obsession. Most of all, I still understand my misadventure, as I did in my most candid and tortured dispatches, more as a lesson about the meaning of the United States than a lesson about “war”.I now think of the society I came from and the war to which I went as part of the same grotesque amusement-park ride. If I have discovered anything since my homecoming, it is that my home has lost its peaceful veneer. An American who leaves for war never leaves America. The war is the society and the society is the war, and one who sees that war sees America.This is what becoming radicalised has meant for me, and it has been jolting. Not long after my discharge in 2011, while I was struggling with severe panic attacks and depression, close friends convinced me to try psychedelics. I found it healing at first, but the last trip landed me in an emergency room. Everyone had become a demon and I was the only human left in their company. From time to time, the psychosis reverberates. I have trouble with elevators and subways, especially when I’m intoxicated, it’s off-hours, and I’m approaching absolute aloneness. I originally attributed the contours of the bad trip to a gnawing sense of guilt. Another telling would have underlined the psychic costs of being shaken into seeing the killing fields behind the facade, even as everyone around you just kept seeing the facade. Such an isolating awakening can trigger, even without the self-reproach, an alienation akin to biblical doom.I have tried my best to keep the treasured ones close, although I have lost a few along the way, and others have threatened to break with me. These have included fellow veterans. One fought in Israel’s Lebanon war in 2006. The other served as one of my most able linguists in Afghanistan. The latter is a Purple Heart recipient from a subsequent deployment. I’ve had exchanges with each that imply recognition of the porousness of propaganda. The linguist, for example, admits the war in Afghanistan has been a disaster and there is no hopeful path forward. But both, despite their time spent on the edge of the abyss, remain beholden to a colonial logic. For them the US and Israel are flawed but necessary bulwarks against barbarism. For me the empire is rooted in the barbarism it pretends to oppose.It is exhausting having to declaim the same talking points over and over again: that the majority of the US official adversaries were once clients and allies. That almost every intervention comes with an ex post facto assessment from the government acknowledging the failure of the mission. That investigative reporters and historians almost always unearth internal documents betraying motives that not only run counter to public rationales but undermine all claims to humanitarian intent. That the US supplies the world with a preponderance of its weapons and fuels a plurality of its animosities. That the US is the only power to have ever dropped the bomb, that it did so twice, and that it did so not to end a world war (a war that was about to end anyway) but to launch what became a half-century-long cold war on superior footing. While not alone as a global malefactor, the US is the world leader in conventional foreign invasions since 1945, with 12 has engineered at least 38 coups or regime changes since the Spanish-American war of 1898 and has offered direct military support and training to dozens of governments with no regard for human rights. The US incarcerates the most people today, both in absolute and relative terms. It has incarcerated the most people for at least 30-odd years, and it either led the world in its incarceration rate or trailed closely behind the Soviet Union and South Africa for the preceding decades. As early as 1976, one study described America’s rate as the “highest in the world and still rising”. By any standard, the US empire ranks among the world’s most formidable producers of violence, and one would be hard-pressed to defend such all-consuming production on liberal democratic grounds.En route to Afghanistan, I read the American political theorist Michael Walzer. Back then, I was still a reluctant believer in the gospel of American righteousness, and when Walzer wrote that the global fight against terrorism was “not backward looking and retributive, but forward looking and preventive”, that was enough to keep me faithful. Walzer had come after a more vulgar procession of neoconservative evangelists like Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan. These were the men who had ushered me to the right as an idealistic high school student, and I became quite the campus missionary when, weeks into my freshman year of college, the two towers fell. I became an opinion columnist and an op-ed editor for the school newspaper, where I penned romantic paeans to the democratising missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of my final contributions was a sombre explanation of why I felt obligated to follow in my grandfather’s footsteps and don the uniform. But by the third month of my deployment, even the subtle apologetics of Walzer struck me as dangerously absurd. If only Walzer and others could see what I saw. If only those who saw it with me could really see it.A longer version of this piece appears in the Winter 2018 issue of n+1 magazine• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36b0dcf58cce8b4a2c8ba99b4ce540310636169/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da0d0f6f38297a97172c4ae72945a6d","title":"2018 a terrible year for facebook podcast","story":"Facebook has been hit by a series of data, privacy and hate speech scandals this year.

Ministers acknowledged the steps that had already been taken, No 10 said, including 320 “no-deal workstreams” across all departments and 106 no-deal technical notices.“Cabinet agreed that with just over three months from our exit from the EU, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations. This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans. Cabinet also agreed to recommend businesses ensure they are similarly prepared enacting their own no-deal plans.”Downing Street suggested preparations could include reserving space on ferries in order to ensure a supply of food and medicines.Speaking later in the Commons, the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said his department “will have 3,500 service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need”.Citizens will be informed how to prepare through a “range of channels” that could include TV adverts and social media. Ministers agreed to allocate money from a £2bn contingency fund to departments such as the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.HMRC will prepare a 100-page pack for all UK businesses on preparing for no-deal, and will send out about 80,000 emails to businesses.During the meeting, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, told her colleagues preparing for a no-deal Brexit was a sensible precaution but “just because you put a seatbelt on doesn’t mean you should crash the car”.The justice secretary, David Gauke, who said publicly at the weekend he would resign rather than be part of a government that deliberately pursued no-deal, told the meeting that a “managed no-deal is not a viable option”.“It’s not on offer from the EU and the responsibility of cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them,” he said, according to a cabinet source.A “managed no-deal” is the approach favoured by Brexit-backing ministers including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, who believe the government could pay part of the £39bn the government has agreed it owes the EU to “purchase” a status quo transition period.Downing Street said delivering the prime minister’s deal “remains the top priority”, but when presented with three options on whether to increase, maintain or wind down preparations, there was unanimity in cabinet to implement all no-deal contingency planning across departments. All agreed that they would implement contingencies across Whitehall. Previously, departments had been given some freedom to decide when and what they spent on no-deal planning.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is among those who have been allocating the most resources, recently advertising for 90 staff for an EU exit crisis centre to respond to emergencies following a no-deal Brexit.Defra, along with the Home Office and the Department for International Trade, are to get the most significant budgets for no-deal preparations.Several ministers pushed for no-deal to become Whitehall’s “central planning assumption”, but Downing Street said its position remained that a deal was the most likely outcome.Speaking after the meeting, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said the default option was for the UK to leave without any exit arrangement in place unless MPs backed the deal.“Parliament needs to back the deal because the consequence of not doing so is we risk the default of no-deal and a responsible government must prepare for that eventuality,” he said. “That is what we agreed at cabinet. That is what we are going to do.”The issues around no-deal planning were not solely financial but also related to decisions over whether to take civil servants off important domestic priorities, one cabinet minister said. “Do you take civil servants off the social care green paper, for example? That’s the choices in front of us,” the minister said.The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said on Tuesday it was “right and proper” for no-deal planning to be stepped up.“We have been taking no-deal seriously for some considerable period,” he said. “I’m not going to pretend otherwise that we are stepping up our preparations for no-deal. Although, frankly the way to avoid that, as I’m sure others would say very clearly, is having parliament voting to secure that deal.”May is trying to persuade rebellious Tory MPs that the alternatives to her Brexit deal are worse than the deal, before the meaningful vote in the week of 14 January.Leave-supporting ministers emerged cheered from the meeting, because the idea of holding a series of indicative votes on Brexit, which has been gaining ground in recent days, was firmly rejected by the prime minister, who is determined to bring her deal back in January.Mordaunt told the meeting she objected to the indicative votes idea because it was a way to “gerrymander” an outcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bbb526e638832d4de6c4fcbd6db81a492451215/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2258f40cfef012d1cc82281da52c45ac","title":"parliament begins to eat itself with no brexit resolution on horizon","story":"Meaningless Westminster debate has turned into more of a Brexit Anonymous therapy sessionWe’ve reached the point where only four diagnoses are now left. The prime minister is in a delusional, psychotic state and is in urgent need of help. Or the prime minister is focused purely on her own short-term survival: even she can’t be so far gone as to believe she has a long-term future. Or the prime minister is a sleeper agent for a hostile government committed to the destruction of the UK. Or the prime minister is totally incompetent.Examine the evidence of the last few weeks. First, she is incapable of keeping almost every commitment she gives: it is now safer to plan for the opposite of what she says will happen. Then she goes to the EU summit and manages to come away with an even worse deal than the already bad one she had secured.And now she has announced the government will be spending £4bn in preparing for a no-deal Brexit that it openly admits it doesn’t want and would be extremely damaging. So rather than do the obvious thing of ruling it out and donating the spare cash to building several hospitals, Theresa May has got Chris Failing Grayling to book extra lorry spaces on cross-Channel ferries and man-boy Matt Hancock to buy a load of fridges in the Curry’s sale. Too little and too late, but all in the faint hope of scaring MPs into voting for her lame-duck deal.What’s left is paralysis. In the absence of a meaningful vote – why would you want to spoil Christmas when there are still over 100 days to go before the UK leaves the EU? – parliament has been reduced to filling the dead air with meaningless debate. Not that many MPs necessarily object to that, as there is nothing they like more than to be given the chance to repeat the same thing they said the day before at greater length, but it doesn’t do much for anyone’s self-esteem. Despair hangs like a choking smog in Westminster.There are few cabinet ministers better suited to acts of extreme pointlessness than Gavin Williamson. The defence secretary makes Hancock look positively statesmanlike, so it was entirely fitting he was sent out to waste an hour of everyone’s time with a statement on his much-delayed report into modernising Britain’s defence capabilities. A report that ran to all of 28 pages, including 10 pages of adverts for photos of Airfix models that Williamson needed to complete his collection.Please take me seriously, pleaded Pte Pike as MPs on both sides of the house started sniggering. No one could. No one ever can. Not even his own family. In desperation, Williamson started threatening to unleash 3,500 troops as part of his department’s contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. They’ll shoot to kill any Jerries that get in their way, Pike shouted. Don’t mention the war! Labour’s shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, gently reminded him that the 3,500 troops in his playpen were actually made of plastic.As there wasn’t much else left for it to do, parliament began to eat itself. The shadow leader, Valerie Vaz, understandably cringed as she was instructed by Jeremy Corbyn to raise a point of order to ask why the government had failed to react meaningfully to Labour’s futile gesture of a meaningless expression of no confidence in the prime minister, at which point the SNP’s Angus Brendan MacNeil raised a second point of order asking if he could table a vote of no confidence in the opposition. Several Labour MPs looked happy to back that one.Then came a three-hour emergency debate to give MPs yet another chance to debate Brexit. Just as they had done the day before. And the day before that. What they weren’t going to get was any resolution. This was more some kind of Brexit Anonymous group therapy session.“My name’s Ian and I’m a Brexit addict,” said the SNP leader Ian Blackford.“It’s all shit and I feel completely powerless over Brexit,” Blackford said.“Thank you for sharing. My name’s Stephen Bartley ... ” said the Brexit secretary.“It’s an anonymous programme. But your name is Stephen Barclay,” the speaker interrupted.“Is it? My name’s Stephen and my job is to know nothing about anything.”“You’re doing brilliantly,” everyone said encouragingly. Bartley beamed. He was never happier than when even he didn’t know who he was.“My name’s Keir and I am embarrassed that Labour is in such a mess over Brexit and is unable to provide any opposition.” said Keir Starmer. “I wish I wasn’t here.” A sentiment with which everyone could agree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70ff0545f80470d4298a79f2a67aa87421d3ffa/0_60_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c8cb9cb95d29d5fb7acfdc2151bc783","title":"theresa may within 20 votes sealing brexit deal say senior tories","story":"Many Tory MPs will fall into line if Northern Irish party can accept deal, say party sourcesTheresa May will be within 20 votes of winning a parliamentary majority for her Brexit deal if she can gain assurances from the EU that will persuade the Democratic Unionist party to back her deal, senior ministers and Tory MPs believe.One cabinet minister said they believed the success of the prime minister’s deal hinged entirely on a last bid to win round the DUP. Another MP said they saw the Northern Irish party as the “British standard” who would give them the reassurance they needed to fall in behind.“You unlock huge numbers of Tory MPs if you can get something the DUP can accept,” the cabinet minister said. “There’s no point at all in holding a vote until you win back the DUP. That is the absolute priority.”Several cabinet sources played down the prospect of any efforts to try to form a coalition of support with Labour MPs and said all efforts were focused on regaining the DUP’s support.“You cannot get this deal through only on the back of Labour votes because it would split the Tory party,” one official said. “That means one thing – bringing the DUP back on board.”Sources said they had also been encouraged in recent days by the more conciliatory noises being made by Eurosceptic Tories after Labour attempted to hold a no-confidence vote in the prime minister.May made great play of a renewed relationship with the DUP when she addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs last week, telling them she had made mistakes and allowed the relationship to “drift” but that she and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, were now on “one page”.The view is similar in Brussels and Dublin. One senior EU source said May’s chances of getting talks reopened in Brussels were doomed until she could communicate to EU negotiators exactly what the DUP will accept in terms of assurances over the Irish backstop.“There is no point in giving any assurances or reopening negotiations if there is no chance of getting a deal approved in the house,” the source said. “She has to go back and find out what the DUP will accept. If that is no backstop then we are in no deal, if it is not, then we can talk.”One former cabinet minister, who has been highly critical of May, said they believed the prime minister may be within “20 or 30 votes” of getting her deal through parliament, depending on whether she could regain the DUP’s support.While the EU has been adamant negotiations on the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened and the backstop must remain, May has indicated that officials are looking at a new solution that would remove the need for the backstop.She told the House of Commons on Monday she would be seeking legal and political assurances around “the firm date for introducing the future relationship”.“That is currently December 2020, we will be continuing discussions on this point,” she said.One MP said this was a “creative idea” because if the new start date was moved to not later than December 2022, this would dovetail with the two-year transition period extension option in the current deal.But one DUP source said: “The difficulty is how can you legally guarantee trade talks will be over by any date?”On Tuesday, the DUP MP Gavin Robinson said the party was engaging constructively with the changes May was pursuing. “She went back to the European commission, she has said that work is ongoing and that the changes will be legally enforceable,” he said.“We are working with the prime minister, she has indicated she will get these assurances and we will assess them at the time. I think we are constructively engaging in the aspiration that we have, and that the majority of parliament has, which is that we need a legally binding assured amendment to the withdrawal agreement.”However, Robinson said there was “little comfort in the documents shared over the weekend” after May attended the Brussels summit of EU leaders.Privately DUP sources were more sceptical of the extent of the progress being made, saying “tinkering around the edges” of the deal would not be enough and that the party remains unconvinced May can extract a guarantee over a firm start date for a future trade deal.It is understood there are no fresh meetings scheduled over Christmas between May and DUP leaders.There are also concerns in the party that anything agreed now which does not have legal standing could be brushed aside by new leaders. “We don’t know what personalities or parties are going to be in power in five years,” one DUP source said.The European commission’s chief spokesman also this week ruled out talks in the near term. “The deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible, we will not reopen it, it will not be renegotiated,” he said. “The European council has given the clarifications that were possible at this stage so no further meetings with the UK are foreseen.”But cabinet sources suggested they were quietly hopeful that restive MPs would have a break away from the hothouse atmosphere in Westminster to reflect on delivering Brexit – and may come back with a more positive view of the deal when parliament finally votes on 14 January.Another said they were more sceptical that MPs would fold on their decision to vote down the deal until they had defeated the plan at least once.One cabinet minister said they believed the failure to oust May via a confidence vote had also been a turning point. Senior Eurosceptic Tories including Jacob Rees-Mogg have since said they intend to accept May’s victory and support the government in any no-confidence vote, though they maintain opposition to the withdrawal deal.“I’ve had my vote of no confidence in her and I lost, and I’m not going to repeat the exercise. The prime minister is secure under the party rules for a year,” he said. “I think to try and rerun something when you have lost it is not reasonable, it is not democratic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe8cb89ffb7bb22d458a9c007078fb39ab24ac2/0_0_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b593db71441416b6d942e0f6a7325640","title":"removing sweets from checkouts could help tackle obesity study","story":"Positioning of snacks near supermarket tills increases their sales, research showsRemoving sweets and crisps from supermarket checkouts could dramatically cut the amount of unhealthy snacks bought to eat on the go, say researchers.Under pressure to act because of rising childhood obesity, some supermarkets have moved snacks away from the till, where people queuing – often with children – are tempted to put them in the shopping basket as they wait their turn.Research shows the positioning of products at the checkout or on the end of aisles increases their sales. The findings suggest that many families who stop adding sweets and crisps at the counter appear not to buy them at all.The study used commercially held data from 7,500 shoppers who recorded food bought and eaten on the go during 2016-17 from supermarkets with and without checkout food policies. On the go purchases are often impulsive and can be the result of children pestering their parents.The researchers, from Cambridge, Stirling and Newcastle universities, also looked at how purchases of less healthy, common checkout foods that were brought home – rather than eaten on the go – changed after the implementation of checkout policies. They used data from more than 30,000 UK households from 12 months before to 12 months after implementation.“Our findings suggest that by removing sweets and crisps from the checkout, supermarkets can have a positive influence on the types of purchases their shoppers make,” said Dr Katrine Ejlerskov, the study’s first author.“This would be a relatively simple intervention with the potential to encourage healthier eating. Many of these purchases may have been impulse buys, so if the shopper doesn’t pick up a chocolate bar at the till, it may be one less chocolate bar that they consume.”Dr Jean Adams, a senior lecturer in dietary public health research at the University of Cambridge, said: “It may seem obvious that removing unhealthy food options from the checkout would reduce the amount that people buy, but it is evidence such as this that helps build the case for government interventions to improve unhealthy behaviours.”The government promised to consult on removing snacks from supermarket checkouts as part of its latest obesity plan. Bryony Sinclair, a senior policy manager at the World Cancer Research Fund, welcomed the study. “Displaying sugary food and drinks at checkouts, tempting shoppers to make unhealthy last-minute decisions, is unacceptable,” she said.“These evidence-informed policies can then be implemented by governments to create environments that support healthier choices, as eating too much sugar can lead to weight gain, and being overweight or obese increases the risk of 12 different types of cancer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f526f206e5c8224518fc72c12d0be33c584847/0_3_4878_2928/master/4878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ab00ae1a024d849dafe4ad5e2573021","title":"cricket england sam curran ipl king","story":"Sam Curran emerged as the big winner from the English hopefuls in Tuesday’s Indian Premier League auction, capping his meteoric rise in international cricket with an £800,000 deal to play for Kings XI Punjab.The Surrey all-rounder will be one of five English newcomers in the IPL next year, with Jonny Bairstow signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for £245,000, Liam Livingstone securing a £55,000 deal at Rajasthan Royals, and Joe Denly (£110,000) and Harry Gurney (£80,000) heading to Kolkata Knightriders.While Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and David Willey had already been retained by their teams, availability was always going to be an issue for others. England’s World Cup players must return to the UK by 24 April for ODIs against Ireland and Pakistan and thus miss the backend of the seven-week IPL that runs to 19 May.Accordingly Jason Roy, Tom Curran, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Liam Plunkett did not enter the auction, preferring to start the summer at their counties. Alex Hales and Chris Woakes went unsold, while the names of Eoin Morgan and Mark Wood did not emerge after the shortlist was trimmed down midway through.Sam Curran, who is centrally contracted by England but seemingly not part of their World Cup plans, had no such issue. And despite an unspectacular Twenty20 record – and the auction’s graphics displaying his brother Tom’s picture – his match-winning performances in the summer’s 4-1 Test series win over India prompted a bidding war, with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals missing out to Kings XI Punjab.“What a year! Couldn’t be more excited to join the @lionsdenkxip at the @IPL in 2019,” the 20-year-old tweeted, having attracted the highest price for an overseas signing in an auction that saw the eight teams add 80 players to their squads.Bairstow’s deal comes after stopping off in Sharjah on the way back from the Sri Lanka tour and smashing a timely 84 off 24 balls in a T10 match. With teams able to retain players for future seasons, Sunrisers have seemingly taken the view that – one of three players to score 1,000-plus ODI runs this year – is a sound long-term investment, even the England opener will play only the first four weeks of next year.Denly twice went unsold in the auction before tempting KKR into a bid. The Kent all-rounder was recently named in England’s ODI squad for the Caribbean but cannot yet be said to have booked his World Cup place.Though Gurney, Nottinghamshire’s former England left-armer, and Livingstone, the Lancashire batsman, picked up relatively minor deals – after tax and various fees, the sums will not be life-changing – the lure of impressing at the IPL is too great.It means missing the first seven weeks of the English summer, which next year includes all but the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup. With the 2020 edition of that competition being played at the same time as the controversial 100-ball tournament, it is a situation that counties will soon have to get used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2376a3474d03f962b2252efc7db2659b8c70e5/0_144_2526_1515/master/2526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7181ddb0882f6dc924cc42b89b2d84","title":"geordan murphy appointed leicester head coach rugby union","story":"Geordan Murphy has been appointed as Leicester’s permanent head coach despite a run of eight straight defeats which has left the Tigers at “their lowest ebb”, according to the former Ireland full-back.Murphy, who has spent 21 years at Leicester as a player and coach, was handed the role on an interim basis when Matt O’Connor was sacked after the first game of the season but has managed only four wins from his 15 matches in charge.The Tigers are all but out of Europe after Sunday’s home defeat by Racing 92 and are only three points from the bottom of the Premiership, but the Leicester hierarchy is determined to avoid more overhaul, having sacked Richard Cockerill, Aaron Mauger and O’Connor in the last 24 months and finalised the decision to appoint Murphy permanently at Monday’s board meeting.“We’ve had a challenging start to the season and we are working hard to improve performances and results, but this is also the start of a journey for this coaching team and playing group,” said Murphy.Leicester are also closing in on a new defence coach, having conceded 292 points in the Premiership this season – the worst in the league – and a further 121 in Europe.

The parties will reconvene at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast on 18 January when it is possible that a date will be set for a full hearing of the case in the spring.McCann, who was 19 at the time when the bets were placed, staked almost £25,000 on 12 horses running in races at Bath, Kempton Park and Naas on 22 June 2016. Bet365 accepted the bets – in all, 960 £13 each-way Lucky 15’s – which were largely successful, producing a potential payout of £984,833.However, Bet365 subsequently refused to pay the winnings, claiming that McCann’s stake for the bet had been provided by a “third party”, in contravention of the firm’s terms and conditions (T\u0026ampCs). It has also refused to refund her initial stake.McCann is suing on the grounds that Bet365 has indulged in what is described, in strict legal terms, as an “unconscionable practice” by discriminating between its customers and either restricting or closing the accounts of punters who make, or threaten to make, a long-term profit.However, her statement also claims that in addition to alleged breaches of consumer law in relation to Bet365’s T\u0026ampCs, other online operators are joining with Bet365 to engage in practices that amount to a breach of the Competition Act 1998.McCann’s legal team will argue that bookmakers could have responded to successful backers by investing in technology and skilled staff to improve the efficiency of their books. Instead, they suggest, “rather than engage in competition between themselves in this fashion, they chose to engage in the informal, parallel and cartel-like behaviour of discriminating against and exploiting customers.”Clive Hawkswood, the chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, the trade body which represents online bookmakers, denied the claim of “cartel-like” behaviour by RGA members.“You’ve only got to look at these companies and the market to see how fiercely competitive they are with each other,” Hawkswood said. “If you are going to maximise the commercial side of things, that will lead to some common practices but any suggestion that they are sitting down and working out ways of doing these things is simply not credible.”Bet365 had not responded by the time of publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd12119df223a3347b496ed96ee47c5b32948359/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94069a0872de65f2e86b8868fa43cf4","title":"readers favourite theatre of 2018","story":"From rapping and rambling to Victorian female boxers, via Liverpool’s Dream, Asian football casuals and a teenage dance troupe, here are some of our readers’ top shows of the yearOne of those plays where, if you read the synopsis, you’d say: “Thanks, I’ll pass.” Three hours where very little happens.

I ventured through snow and ice from well outside the capital to see this and it was absolutely worth the effort. Girls \u0026amp Boys has stayed with me across the year. Matt HillsI loved the energy of the play and the fact it spoke to a crowd not usually found in a theatre. Iain IrvineI had seen the original NT production but found this version of Alan Bennett’s play better in every way. Matthew Kelly gave an outstanding performance but all the cast, the staging and production were excellent. I left the theatre intellectually stimulated and emotionally uplifted. Great to know theatre of this quality is touring the so-called provinces. John EastmanAn incendiary piece that takes us on a journey of love, laughter and unbearable sorrow. Astounding performances from a top-notch ensemble. Lopez’s text is layered, witty and enlightening. A modern classic. Jasmine Henderson-PenningtonAlthough the show was nominally about a rape, it was also a beautiful and desperately moving celebration of love and friendship. I didn’t realise how much it got to me until I tried to tell a friend about it when I got home from Edinburgh and just describing it made me cry again. Andrew CowieWho knew banking could be so interesting? Sam Mendes brought Ben Power’s moving adaptation of Stefano Massini’s novel to life in a stunning staging. The rise and fall of a world-famous financial institution, Lehman Brothers, is told through the eyes of the three brothers who travelled from Bavaria to New York in 1844 and their descendants. Simon Russell-Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley gave outstanding performances as a multitude of different characters ning more than 150 years while Es Devlin’s set design was a huge character in itself. Kris WitheringtonPerfectly encapsulates with devastating honesty what it’s like to be a 13-year-old girl. Sophie FoxI was surprised at the critics’ reviews, which were average to say the least. The performance I attended received a standing ovation and rightfully so. The three main actors, Alex Hassell, Siân Brooke and Joshua McGuire, bounced off each other beautifully and this is how a play should be great dialogue, great acting and with something to say. God knows in this mad age of Brexit, and 10 years under an out-of-control Conservative government, we could really do with someone like Pauline Gibson (the main protagonist) to come along and galvanise everyone. Karen JonesVictorian women’s boxing is an intriguing theme for a play but my assumption that it would be a bit of a “girl power” production was completely wrong. It’s actually the beautifully choreographed story of how easily women’s power can be taken away, and the parallels with recent #MeToo stories made it hit home even more powerfully. I left feeling like I’d learned something about myself as a women. Klara WertheimAnna Deavere Smith’s one-woman show (accompanied by Marcus Shelby’s music) was mesmerising. It filled me with knowledge, sadness, anger and laughter about the trauma of America’s racial issues. The acting was masterful, humane and so truthful. Sherma Polidore-PerrinsDelivered with fierce intensity, two actors exuded the life and the landscape of Wales. I was transported back to my childhood, wondering about the stories of my grandparents’ generation – it felt like a door opened to the past. As I look back on life and interpretations of family and marriage, it remains relevant to the present. Clare LipetzIt was the raw ambition of the piece that still astounded, 35 years after seeing the original. The postwar history of the British left doesn’t sound like a bundle of laughs but David Edgar gets quite a few attached to a riveting narrative. This masterful production by Owen Horsley featured a magnificent cast that doubled and even trebled roles galore. Hugh SachsOut of all the flurry of the Edinburgh fringe, this show shone out as one of incredible talent, humour, stone-cold bops, incredible hairography and raw, personal, emotional storytelling. It used the beauty of drag and song to talk about joy, pain, queer lives and the intersections of race and mental health. Le Gateau Chocolat is wildly lovable and has you singing along, dancing and shedding a tear all at the same time. Michael WieldIt was so refreshing to see a play about being a mother that didn’t make me want to roll my eyes and scream. Mental health and motherhood, too, which isn’t talked about or explored enough. It was funny, moving and honest. Excellent set design and lighting too in such a small theatre and a great performance by Tricia Kelly. Sophie UrwinBeautiful, heartbreaking and hilarious. Arinzé Kene gave one of the most powerful performances I have ever seen. It was exactly the sort of play the British theatre and arts industry in general should be supporting and nurturing. It’s the only play I’ve gone back to see a second time. I just needed to see it again. T SandersMy two favourite activities are theatre and walking. This was a perfect play for me. It was beautifully acted and had a mystical element fused with humour and a thoughtful exploration of people’s lives. At the end I whooped and that does not happen often. I met people while walking who had also seen it and discovered it had a universal appeal. “We walk, we walk, we walk.” Lynne McKenzieA fantastic portrayal of the effects of war on soldiers and their families. I found it very healing, funny and sad. Gina MoxonIn the midst of a year of vitriol against trans people, Travis Alabanza’s piece was so clever, poignant, reflective and timely. It didn’t sit in pity, it challenged the whole room and used humour too. Tremendous work. Desiree BehardHaley McGee is a highly engaging and fearless performer. Quantifying romance into cold hard cash is a theme as old as time itself but this show put a wonderfully modern spin on it. The story made me re-examine my own romantic history. Elra DesmondFour giants walking the streets of Liverpool, watched by a quarter of a million people, was the most original piece of theatre I’ve ever witnessed. Mark McNultyThe most incredible performance of storytelling theatre with just one actor and one musician. A play with original songs with no need for set or props, the overwhelming skills and techniques of two performers is all it needed. A working-class story seldom heard on our stages – one of community, family, sport and the love and loss of industry. Jayne WilliamsFrom the ingenious and surprising redesign of the traditional proscenium of the Playhouse theatre, to the brilliant performances, this show staggered me. Both uplifting and profoundly moving, the play delivered a vital message about humanity, compassion and understanding without preaching. Dominic BrewerBecause it sounded as angry as I feel.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5faabfe9667ee2cd4464d8524194f0f59fdc91ee/0_0_1035_621/master/1035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c22ffb112a6c6c5b0aa920226f69f539","title":"the slumflowers guide to peckham londons coolest neighbourhood","story":"We spoke to blogger and author Chidera Eggerue (AKA the Slumflower) as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series – where innately curious people reveal the ‘ordinary’ places and things that inspire them. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we explore how she started a culturequake that’s been felt throughout the media ever since. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithLiv Little walks into Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour office with a smile that is as big and bright as her red puffer coat, impressive considering how exhausted she is. We’re here to discuss the rise of women and non-binary people of colour in media, an industry in which Little has emerged as a bright new star. It’s the reason we asked her to be part of the  Labs’s and Google Pixel 3’s Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, where innately curious people discuss how they discover the extraordinary all around them. Little collapses into the waiting arms of a slouchy upholstered chair, humbly receiving congrats on the runaway success of her independent digital and print zine, gal-dem, from a producer who has popped in to say hi.In a year that has been “Feminist AF”. In the age of #MeToo, self care, #BlackGirlMagic and #GirlsDoingWhateverTheFuckTheyWant, it’s not surprising that 2018 has also been the year of Little and gal-dem. It’s hard to find a young woman who better sums up the cultural shift. Her publication, with a corrective emphasis on intersectional feminism, is produced by a team of outspoken, socially conscious, whip-smart young women and non-binary people of colour, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s a refreshing change from the publishing world’s longstanding homogenous population of largely white, mostly cisgender, predominantly privileged and Oxbridge-educated citizenry.“I wanted to connect with other women and non-binary people of colour. I wanted it to be a free space where people can come and read about experiences like their own,” Little explains of gal-dem’s beginnings. “I realised that it’s a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back.”Add Little to the list of young women interrogating and disrupting historically white, tough-to-break-into professions globally – women such as the newly elected 29-year-old Latinx US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the black British book publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove.Little and gal-dem reflect the moment as much as they are the moment. And their rise coincides with a new wave of women and non-binary people of colour who felt their voices were not being heard in the everyday, so did something extraordinary to get it out there – notably carving space for themselves in the UK media world including Slay in Your Lane authors Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, journalist Afua Hirsch and the influencer and body positivity activist Chidera “The Slumflower” Eggerue.Meanwhile, gal-dem’s growing team of more than 15 editors, writers and assistants have been juggling projects that rival those of legacy publishing giants with exponentially larger staffs – a truly extraordinary achievement. There was the takeover of the  Weekend Magazine in August, during a month when black women ruled the September glossy monthly covers. And then there was the summer launch of gal-dem’s partnership with Liberty London and Dialogue Books to create a literature course, aptly titled Rewriting the Canon and dedicated to iconic authors of colour. Add to that an exhibition they curated in June about the Windrush generation for City Hall and a week-long pop-up with Penguin in November to celebrate the launch of Michelle Obama’s global phenomenon of a book, Becoming. The pop-up featured events that centred on various themes in the former first lady’s memoir – from a discussion about black motherhood to a talk with businesswoman and activist Gina Miller.This hardly scratches the surface of the long list of wins gal-dem has had since Little first launched the project as a student at the University of Bristol back in 2015.Little had an “overwhelmingly positive” childhood, growing up in south-east London with a close relationship to her Buddhist mother and human rights worker aunt (her mum’s identical twin). She didn’t experience the negative and isolating aspects of being a woman of colour navigating white environments until she started university, where she studied politics and sociology. “My childhood was very much about me being comfortable enough to know that my voice is as important as anyone else’s. And then I went to uni and saw a disparity in circumstances that I had never seen before. I was around the super elite for the first time – people who had cards with family bank names on them, people with very conservative beliefs. It was different from what I was used to back home with my mum’s erse roster of friends. I was in a place where I was studying things and suddenly I had this feeling of: ‘Why is there no space for me?’”It was a question women of colour were asking the world over – using everyday, free platforms such as Instagram to create and market the kinds of extraordinary imagery and storytelling they wanted to see, but couldn’t find in mainstream media. And so gal-dem became the UK’s biggest success story in what emerged as a global wave of independent upstarts by women and non-binary people of colour, including Well Read Black Girl – a US-based online book club and content platform-turned Brooklyn literary festival – and Azeema Mag, an annual print zine dedicated to women within the Menasa region (Middle East, north Africa and south Asia).Now, gal-dem is not just a space for Little, but hundreds of contributors around the world, with content that is as erse as its readership. A scroll through the site reveals stories and news that feel very much like the charged WhatsApp threads taking place between women of a certain mindset – outspoken, socially conscious women who identify with prominent outspoken, socially conscious women such as Roxane Gay, Tracee Ellis Ross, Michaela Coel and Yara Shahidi. The articles on gal-dem have titles such as Are you a woke pixie dream girl?, Why Solange is my style icon, and The sex-deprived lives of young women who move back home. The tone strikes a balance that’s difficult to achieve between critical and cheery, knowing and earnest. And it resonates with women of all backgrounds. “I’ve received a lot of emails from white mothers saying that it’s been a really useful resource to help them understand their daughters. And I get a lot of young people asking me what to do to start a magazine,” she says.That leads us to the other extraordinary part of Little’s trajectory that she’s a media success story at a time when the industry is having an identity crisis. “It’s hard because the media is not always the nicest industry to be in and progress through. The environment can be hostile,” Little says, before thinking back to her time navigating jobs at television networks. “I’ve been in situations where I was the only person in the room who looked like me. You can find yourself tokenised.”But for the past year, she’s made gal-dem her full-time job – with the exception of freelance roles as contributing editor of Elle UK and a factual executive producer at the BBC – devoting all of her energy to turning her platform into a viable business. Does it sound like an empire in the making? For Little, it’s all to play for. “It’s now just a case of growing it further,” she says. And with that, a second producer comes in to greet her. It’s time to go on-air.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918f8648f8865da47d41868357fe6094ac7b10cc/243_197_848_509/master/848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01eda81d4cbd9e912c3e7365ac96461e","title":"10 ways to make the everyday extraordinary","story":"In this fast-paced digital world, it’s all too easy to live life on autopilot. From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell.

Cuomo commissioned a study by the state Health Department, which recommended allowing recreational marijuana.Neighboring New Jersey is also moving toward legalization, leading many to question how enforcement would be possible just across the river in New York and Cuomo to say that the “facts have changed” on the drug.In New York City, police have stopped making arrests of most people caught holding or publicly smoking marijuana, giving them summonses instead.Medical marijuana is already permitted in New York.Legalizing recreational pot could generate $1.3bn a year in taxes for the state and city, a report found this year.Democrats won control of the state senate in November’s midterm elections, making it likely that the legislature will be receptive to a legalization bill.Debate has already started on where a tax windfall should go. One proposal, pushed by the former city council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, would use the money to fix the city’s crumbling subway system.The call to legalize pot came amid a speech outlining a sweeping and largely liberal agenda from a governor who has moved to the left amid potential presidential ambitions, and a primary challenge from the left last year by the actor Cynthia Nixon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59808a8b0cf34b4201862ac97a040d7ea59b75b/0_216_4155_2492/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323fd0607684cf85e3394abc506c6cf2","title":"colombia massacre","story":"Six people have been killed in a remote Colombian town notorious as the site of one of the worst massacres of the country’s civil war, stoking fears that the brutal violence of the past has returned.President Iván Duque tweeted confirmation of the massacre that took place in Mapiripán, in Colombia’s eastern plains, on Monday night. Initial reports say one minor was among those murdered.The Colombian government signed a peace deal with leftist insurgents the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc) in late 2016, formally ending 52 years of civil war that left more than 260,000 dead and 7 million displaced. The military and state-aligned paramilitary groups contributed to the bloodshed.That deal was supposed to usher in a new, peaceful chapter in Colombia’s history, but atrocities continue at an alarming pace. At least seven massacres have been committed by myriad groups since March last year, while murders of human rights defenders and local activists have soared since the signing of the peace deal.Mapiripán has been a byword for atrocity since July 1997, when a paramilitary death squad armed with chainsaws and machetes beheaded and butchered dozens of people suspected of collaborating with the rebels. Estimates of the death toll range between 13 and 77 but the final figure has never been established as victims’ bodies were dumped in a nearby river.It is not yet clear who is responsible for the latest massacre. Authorities have speculated that it is the result of a dispute between local drug trafficking gangs. The region, a key drug trafficking corridor, has long been frequented by Farc dissidents who chose not to lay their weapons following the 2016 deal, as well as resurgent paramilitary groups who ignored their own demobilisation process in 2006.For locals, once again caught between rifle fire, it does not matter who is behind the latest barbarism.“Once again it’s Mapiripán having to live through a massacre. It has opened up a trauma we thought we had put behind us,” said Mayerly Triana Hoyos, a survivor of the 1997 massacre. “Living among armed gangs, both ex-paramilitary and ex-Farc, is a fact of life for us here.”Hoyos said the army had not done enough to protect civilians in the rural hamlets nearby, where Monday’s massacre took place. “They go out on patrol but they don’t cover enough ground around here,” she said. “We are angry and we are scared because we have been abandoned.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ee5c903e4cda5d1068c52443ad292b092acc0d/0_150_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f9458034f3dee859fe7a1604231cd","title":"russia turkey and iran reach agreement on syria committee","story":"UN says Moscow rejected five names its envoy wanted included in proposed panelThe three self-appointed guarantors of the Syrian peace process – Russia, Turkey and Iran – have spurned efforts by the UN to change the composition of a committee due to write a new constitution for the country.The 150-strong committee, due to start work next year, could pave the way for UN-supervised elections and a possible peace process that would encourage millions of refugees to return to their homeland.The agreement on the committee’s formation was formally reached by the three countries on Tuesday in Geneva and the proposals passed to the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, for his endorsement and for consideration by the UN security council on Thursday.The Geneva agreement was signed off by the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and Iran’s Javad Zarif, underlining how the west has lost control of the Syrian crisis to the trio of countries in the so-called Astana Group.Without taking questions, Lavrov read out a brief statement saying the three countries believed the committee could start to meet in Geneva early next year and would lead to “a viable and lasting Syrian-owned, Syrian-led, UN-facilitated political process”.The UN said Russia rejected five names that De Mistura wanted to add to the list, and the envoy’s absence from the brief press conference did not bode well.In a statement, De Mistura said there was an extra mile to go in the marathon to construct a credible and balanced constitutional committee, and his successor would have to take up the task in the new year. De Mistura stands down at the end of the year after four years as special envoy.The Russian refusal to make further concessions will anger the US, but the state department’s leverage in Syria as anything but a spoiler is limited.The official Syrian opposition, the Syrian Negotiating Committee, has previously complained that the proposed committee is not politically balanced and may not touch sufficiently on the powers of the president.Russia first promised to set up a constitutional committee for Syria in January at a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, but disagreement over the committee’s composition, as well as fighting in Syria, slowed progress.The proposed committee consists of government supporters, opposition members and a neutral group from civilian society. The true political allegiance of the third group is critical since it will hold the political balance of power.De Mistura is said to be under heavy pressure from the trio of countries to accept the makeup of the constitutional body, but he may leave the decision to UN security council in New York on Thursday.He said at the weekend: “The last word is with us, with the UN, not with any country, as good and as powerful as they may be.”The US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, speaking on Monday at the Atlantic Council thinktank in Washington, said the official Syrian opposition’s stance represented “a huge problem for De Mistura”.“There is a strong readiness on the part of western nations not to ante up money for that disaster unless we have some kind of idea that the government is ready to compromise and thus not create yet another horror in the years ahead.”But Jeffrey said if an agreement on the committee could be reached, the path to a UN-monitored national ceasefire would be the next logical step.De Mistura, in briefing the UN security council this week, will have to address US suspicions and set out how he thinks the committee can be made more balanced and credible. Details of how the committee would operate or be chaired appear to be only sketchily agreed. President Bashar al-Assad wants the committee to meet in Damascus, a venue rejected by the opposition.If the UN and the Astana group are able to reach agreement, the outcome would represents a form of legacy for De Mistura at the end of his period in office. He has been criticised by some for failing to do more to secure an agreement during the seven-year civil war, but his defenders say he could not have brokered an agreement if the key external powers were unwilling to lever the forces they sponsored inside Syria to compromise.On Sunday Çavuşoğlu said he could envisage Turkey accepting Assad remaining as president if he was elected in free and fair elections. Turkey, along with Saudi Arabia, has done the most to support the severely weakened opposition.For more than a year the European Union has said it will not provide reconstruction money for Syria unless democratic elections are agreed and supervised by the UN in which refugees are given a right to vote."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Brian Farrell A sister and one of her brothers evicted from a Roscommon farmhouse last week, prompting a violent retaliation by vigilantes against security guards at the home, were back in possession of the property last night.The eviction of farmer Anthony McGann, along with his sister and brother, from Falsk, near Strokestown, Co Roscommon, was ordered by the Circuit Court after a judgment was given against him.Mr McGann, who was forced to pay €429,501 to settle a Revenue tax debt in 2015 for underdeclaration of VAT, has had a number of judgments against him, including one for non-payment of a loan on a Land Rover. Video footage posted last night on social media showed gardaí advising the farmer that he should get a solicitor in view of the court order against him and under which he had lost his home.The gardaí then left the farmhouse at Falsk after what were described as “very polite” exchanges between a garda and Mr McGann, who were on first-name terms.Confirming that one of the McGann brothers and their sister, Geraldine had returned, a family friend, Donal Hanley, said they wanted to take their home back. The financial issues that led to the eviction are “a private matter”, he said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and Minister for Justice, Charlie Flanagan had condemned the “violent actions of vigilantes, which have led to injuries, animal deaths and very serious property damage”.And the director-general of the Law Society, Ken Murphy expressed concern, saying the situation was “hugely difficult and emotionally charged” but people could not take the law into their own hands.The house has been damaged following the events of the last week. Broken glass could be seen strewn around, while, at the rear, the window to the bathroom had also been smashed. Beside two large and undamaged wooden garages, four Ford Transit vans lay completely burned out following Sunday night’s violence, plus two fire-damaged cars, including a BMW. “There’s a lot of anger in the community on two fronts – both over the eviction and violence that occurred last Sunday morning. People do not want to see this type of violence occurring in their community,” Mr Murphy said.Gardaí are now investigating the vigilante attack on Sunday, but also the events surrounding the eviction, following a complaint. The Minister for Justice has said the regulations covering private security firms will be reviewed.There is, he said, a legal anomaly whereby security guards on duty in a nightclub or elsewhere must be identifiable, whereas there is no similar obligation under the law for those involved in evictions. Officials are to report back to the Minister in January on the matter."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3735294.1545132172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"surfer may have broken world record after riding 30m wave","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Tom Butler (centre) riding massive wave at at Praia do Norte in Nazaré, Portugal.

Onlookers estimate the swell was 30.5m (100ft) - which if confirmed will easily beat the last world record of 24.4m by Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa last year in the same location.Butler (29) said surfing the swell on December 14th was like “running away from a raging bull”. In a social media post, the professional surfer said he was “blown away” with all the attention. “It’s a magic ride that I can keep in my memory bank forever. I never go out in the water trying to break any record, it’s not really a personal goal of mine. I just want to surf big waves as much as possible and do what I love.”Butler will have to submit photographic evidence to the World Surf League (WSL), which will confirm if he has broken the record at the WSL awards next April.Originally from Cornwall, Butler has been surfing since age 10. He has won various titles including the world record for the tallest wave in 2014. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3735975.1545155635!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit heckler ejected from irish embassy annoyed at envoy s second vote joke","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photograph of journalist Joanna Bell (left) with   Kim Kardashian. Photograph: Joanna BellTwitterA Daily Mail journalist who was ejected from a party at the Irish embassy in London for heckling the ambassador’s speech said she was annoyed at his suggestion of a possible second Brexit referendum.Joanna Bell, a Daily Mail journalist who is originally from a village near Dundalk, Co Louth, was asked to leave the embassy’s Christmas party on Monday evening after disrupting the speech given by Irish ambassador Adrian O’Neill. Ms Bell interrupted Mr O’Neill’s address at the festive drinks reception after he made comments intended to be humorous on the possibility of the UK’s departure from the EU being put to a second vote. At one point, she shouted “Brexit!” before being escorted from the room at the embassy near Westminster. The embassy’s “Politics \u0026amp Press” party, a popular event in London’s social calendar for politicos and journalists, was attended by prominent figures from politics and the media. British chancellor Philip Hammond was among the guests.Ms Bell, a former Irish customs officer, voted for the UK to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum but describes herself now as “a staunch Brexiteer” and a “big advocate of democracy” in support of the 2016 vote.She believes that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and others in the EU have behaved in a “contemptible manner” towards UK prime minister Theresa May and this has made her switch her support.Suggestions of a second Brexit referendum have reminded her of how Irish voters were asked to vote again on the Lisbon Treaty referendum in 2009.“My unfortunate ejection from the embassy followed my response to the suggestion, made by the ambassador Mr O’Neill, that a second Brexit referendum should take place,” she told The .“A second referendum would have the highly unfortunate consequences for this polarised and still combustible island. It’s not that mandates should never be withdrawn or a referendum reconsidered,” she said. “If, however, a democratic outcome is to be re-considered, it must first be respected. What could be more damaging than a second referendum if Remain wins as narrowly as it lost the first? We would find ourselves in a precarious state.” Ms Bell apologised unreservedly to the ambassador and his wife for disrupting their party.“Obviously, I profoundly regret the excessive robustness and perhaps lack of finesse with which I expressed my disagreement with the ambassador,” she said.“I had, I confess, enjoyed a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat who is a staunch Brexiteer.” Ms Bell said she worked as a customs guard on the Irish Border in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in 2006, based out of Dundalk.The Department of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the incident at the embassy.Mr O’Neill, known for his calm and unflappable manner, is said to have noticed Ms Bell’s interjection but “handled it fairly diplomatically,” said one attendee.In his speech, the ambassador told guests that he was grateful for the “goodwill and friendship” the embassy has benefited from in London. He also thanked them “for that sense of friendship towards the embassy, towards Ireland and above all towards continued warm and friendly relations between our two countries.” "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

However, the company has blamed unsafe conditions and said it could bring legal action to recoup the cost of damage to the ship and the Russian Embassy has launched an investigation.The 16,000 tonne ship was grounded in the early hours of Tuesday morning and the Falmouth coastguard and the RNLI undertook a day-long mission to rescue it and its 18 crew members.Volunteers battled through gale force 9 winds to get the Kuzma Minin which had sailed from the Netherlands to the UK some days previously, safely afloat.There were worries that if they did not manage to float it at high tide, around 1.15pm, they would have to wait until the tide came back in at around 1am, leaving the crew members stuck onboard. Luckily, they managed to tug it out to sea at around 2.30pm.Dramatic footage showed a coastguard pilot being winched onto the ship from a helicopter to help those on board.However, the deputy director of the Murmansk Shipping Company, which owns the Kuzma Minin, said the ship had become stuck due to unsafe shipping conditions off the British coast.Murmansk is one of the primary shipping companies operating in northern Europe and Arctic Russia The ship got caught on some sort of chain that was on the bottom of the strait, Ildar Neverov told state news agency RIA Novosti.That is to say there were unsafe shipping conditions in the place where the ship was located. As a result, it passed some distance out of control and ran aground. The situation is under control.He said that he may bring legal action, adding: “We will clearly state our position on the fact that the conditions for safe navigation in this area have not been created... we will definitely look at recovery of damages.”The Falmouth coastguard declined to comment.It was thought that the weather conditions contributed to the accident, and Met Office had issued a yellow warning for severe weather with 65mph winds forecast. Gales were recorded at up to 74mph in Cornwall and 40 knots on the River Tamar - disrupting traffic.Former Falmouth senior pilot captain David Barnicoat told BBC Radio Cornwall: It’s a classic grounding in bad weather and strong winds. The wind overnight was pretty horrendous. Where I live I hadn’t heard wind like it for quite a few years.It sounds as if she dragged anchor and the engines may not have been ready or she may have had some other problem. Once that anchor breaks from the sea bed and you start dragging then you have no control whatsoever.The Falmouth coastguard has been contacted for comment about the safety of the shipping conditions. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the 590ft ship had dragged its anchor and has a list of about five degrees.The RNLI added: Falmouth RNLI volunteers have been afloat since 6.15am in horrendous conditions assisting a 16,000 tonne Russian cargo ship which ran aground off Gyllyngvase beach earlier this morning (Tuesday 18 December).Volunteer crews were woken abruptly to the sound of their pagers shortly after 6am, with a request from Falmouth Coastguard to launch the all-weather lifeboat Richard Cox Scott.With coxswain John Blakeston at the command, the lifeboat proceeded to the scene off Gyllyngvase beach, arriving shortly after 6.20am. The lifeboat has been standing by the vessel since to ensure everyone’s safety.The volunteers have missed a day at work and have re-arranged their plans for the day to help the situation, illustrating their dedication and commitment to saving lives at sea.Serena and Venus Williams\u0026#39s father left severely disabled by series of strokes as he fights ex-wife for houseRemoving sweets from checkouts means shoppers half as likely to succumb to \u0026#39pester power\u0026#39Comment: Forget the Government.

But critics have accused them of “punishing” the child for the parents’ political views.The child, parents and school have not been named under Germany’s strict child protection laws. But the father is understood to be a member of the regional parliament for Berlin.The school has been heavily criticised by the Berlin regional government. Sandra Scheeres, the regional education minister and a member of the centre-Left Social Democratic Party (SPD), said she was “extremely critical” of the decision. The regional school board has demanded an explanation.The school in question follows the Waldorf School philosophy, which rejects traditional teaching methods in favour of more participatory learning. Parents are heavily involved in education and activities under the Waldorf system, and the school said it feared this could create a “constant potential for conflict”.Teachers at the school reportedly held extensive meetings with the child’s parents, at which they were questioned about their political views.“We tried to find a consensual solution to the conflict, but were unable,” the director of the school association said.But critics have questioned whether the school’s decision may be linked to an AfD policy which encourages children to report teachers who criticise the party to its websites.Though the school is private and fee-paying it is partially funded by government subsidies and comes under the control of the regional school board — a common arrangement in Germany.German private schools can select their pupils to a limited extent — for instance to balance gender numbers or give priority to those with siblings already at the school — but discrimination is not allowed.The school in question is forced to select in practice because it is heavily oversubscribed, with 140 applications for just 30 places this year.But the rejected child was already at the attached kindergarten, which usually makes it easier to get a place at the school.“We really liked this school,” the child’s father told Berliner Kurier newspaper. “How can we explain to our child that his friends can join the Waldorf school next year but that we are not welcome there?”Alternative for Germany (AfD)Serena and Venus Williams\u0026#39s father left severely disabled by series of strokes as he fights ex-wife for houseRemoving sweets from checkouts means shoppers half as likely to succumb to \u0026#39pester power\u0026#39Comment: Forget the Government.

It would be funded by a mandatory levy on accounting firms.“We need to build a new house,” Mr Kingman told reporters.KPMG is on the accountancy naughty step again over Ted Baker auditThe new watchdog - the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority - would directly regulate auditors, be forward looking and draw a line under a creaky, leaky, ramshackle and “excessively consensual” FRC perceived to be too close to the Big Four, Mr Kingman said.The new watchdog would also have additional powers to pursue any company director if it found wrongdoing.FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has already said he would step down next year. The board of the new regulator would decide whether to keep on current FRC staff.Separately, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Tuesday published interim findings of its audit market review, which it began a few months ago.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?Carillion: Will watchdogs now finally try to break up big auditors?Deloitte UK admits to substantial BAME gender pay gap “We propose that FTSE 350 audit should be carried out jointly by two firms, at least one of which should be from outside the Big Four,” the CMA said.The subsidiaries of a company would be ided up among the two auditors, with both approving the consolidated accounts.New laws would be needed to implement many of the Kingman recommendations and the CMA proposals, which will be finalised in early 2019.The business ministry welcomed the recommendations, but it may have to hold a public consultation. It faces a parliament clogged by Brexit and a new regulator is unlikely to emerge before 2020.Rachel Reeves, chair of parliament’s business committee, said a new regulator should be able to spot signs of corporate failure and step in before it was too late.“We will take a close eye to the CMA and Kingman recommendations and examine what needs to be done to deliver on these reports,” Ms Reeves said.European Union and British reforms introduced in the past two years to increase audit market competition ended up with companies switching between the Big Four rather than hiring smaller rivals like Grant Thornton or BDO.“These intractable problems may take some years to sort out,” said CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie. “If it turns out that the proposals are not far-reaching enough, the CMA will persist until the problems are addressed.”Mr Kingman said a new regulator would bring an end to current industry self-regulation through professional bodies like the ICAEW. FRC oversight of actuaries should be moved to the Bank of England, he said.In France, joint audits are already common and help smaller accountants like Mazars to break into the top end of the market. Joint audits are estimated to cost about 20 per cent more than having a single auditor.The CMA said if joint audits did not work, a possible alternative would to be ensure that some major audit contracts were only available to non-Big Four accountants - a step the industry proposed in the summer.The CMA stopped short of calling for a break-up of the Big Four but proposed putting their audit and advisory services into separate operating entities.An audit business would have its own board, staff and profit pool for bonuses so it can focus on quality book-keeping.Other recommendations include giving the new regulator powers to intervene in a firm’s audit, and a “duty of alert” that requires auditors to tell the regulator if they have serious concerns about a company’s viability.The CMA recommendations are open for public consultation until mid-January.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The remarkable surge in value was followed by a series of price crashes that saw bitcoin tumble by thousands of dollars in the space of just a few days, before a steady decline took hold of the market and forced the cryptocurrency down to today\u0027s price of just $3,400.If losses continue, the price collapse could be worse than any previously experienced by bitcoin.Today is an opportunity to look back at all the people who told you that this was going to be a new world, that you were missing out, or that you didn\u0027t understand the new paradigm taking place, and cut them out of your life, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at online financial platform Investing.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBitcoin holds a big promise of sovereign and sound money – the bubble we experienced a year ago was an unfortunate consequence of human greed and short term thinking.

It’s important to remember that all assets, in every market, experience a process of price discovery, and that cryptos are no different. Given the rapid growth of the crypto industry in the past years, this process has been accelerated, but long-term investors should not be deterred.CoinMarketCap)Like many other analysts, Mr Green is quick to note that this is not the first cycle that bitcoin has experienced in its 10 year history.Five previous cycles saw bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent from its high before eventually recovering to a level above that high.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The latest price fall may seem dramatic due to the numbers involved but it still only represents an 83 per cent fall in value from its December 2017 price. But bitcoin only needs to fall by another $1,000 before the latest losses become record losses.\u0026nbspAs for a short 2019 outlook, I don\u0027t see Bitcoin reaching new highs in 2019, Mr Thibault said.I believe too many would-be early adopters got burnt badly last year, and once an asset has been labelled a bubble, a gamble, or a speculative investment, it takes time to rebuild the trust and appeal needed to push the asset forward.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Averse to exercise. You see him on the Vitality posters on the Underground. It’s a clever advertising ploy because the point is to get you to do more exercise. And the surprising thing – if you look more closely – is it’s all about insurance.It used to be you bought life or health insurance, stuck the paperwork in a drawer, and then forgot about it, until you got ill or they called for the priest. That has all changed – as Herschel Mayers, CEO of Vitality, explained to me. Born in Zimbabwe, he was brought up in Johannesburg, and ides his time between South Africa and London. After a few years with Liberty, Mayers co-founded Discovery Life, now the largest insurer in South Africa. He joined forces with Prudential in 2014 to set up Vitality. Now 58, he trained as an actuary, so he’s good at mathematics and statistics and probabilities and improbabilities. But stick with me here, because he is also good at making it simple. Personal confession: many moons ago I turned down the opportunity to go about selling insurance because I thought of it as too doom-laden and didn’t want to scare the pants off people (“You know you’re going to die, don’t you? Stop kidding yourself, you’d better be prepared!”).The genius of Herschel Mayers lies in changing the narrative. He has spun insurance around 180 degrees and turned it away from being about dying or getting ill and made it all about keeping fit and well and living longer. He made me feel healthier just talking to him. A View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonHouzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techVitality has a so-called “wellness philosophy”, but this isn’t as hazy and airy-fairy as it sounds. You know all those good intentions you blithely announce around New Year and then it all goes to pot until the next round of solemn promises? Mr Mayers doesn’t want you to revert to couch potato. “Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and exercise is good,” says Mayers. The interesting question he asks is, “How do you get people to change their behaviour for the better?” His answer is more carrot than stick – or, as it is now known, “behavioural economics”. This is how it works: you sign up to Vitality. Vitality straight off the bat gives you a 40 per cent discount, providing you agree to go to the gym regularly. And they give you juicy little incentives along the way if you stick by your commitment – free cinema tickets, coffee at Starbucks, an Amazon Prime subscription. The benevolent Mr Mayers is, in effect, paying you to keep hitting the cross-trainer or doing your 10,000 steps every day. The more steps, the less smoking, the better the incentive. Conversely, your discount is “eroded” over time if you slack and go back to your bad old ways. Can’t I just phone in or email to say how good I’ve been? Mayers has anticipated my would-be cunning deception. “That’s why we give you an ‘activity tracker’. We monitor your good behaviour.” So you actually have to clock in at the gym. They know if your heartbeat goes up or not. “It has to be verifiable,” says Mayers. So don’t think you can just sneak outside and have a quick fag. Such is the joy of social media. “We have daily interaction.”But, I can’t help wondering, isn’t that a bit tyrannical? \u0026nbsp“It would be, if we were forcing you,” says Mayers, reasonably enough. “But we’re not forcing you, it’s your choice to buy into the system in the first place. You don’t have to do it. But it makes more sense.” The logic of the deal is the “shared value model”, developed originally by Professor Michael E Porter at Harvard, a theory Mayers has translated into practice. The Vitality customer or “member” is given a subtle (or not so subtle) “nudge” in the direction of staying in better nick for longer. The value, or benefit, is shared by both the insured – who gets to enjoy life more, both quantitatively and qualitatively – and the insurer, who pays out less on claims. Everyone is a winner, including the nation as a whole, which gets one more useful and productive citizen to add to the GDP, and the NHS, which has one less chronically ill patient to look after for years on end. “By changing behaviour,” says Mayers, “we want to create additional economic value.” Call me a nanny-state guy if you will, but, realistically, when you’re up against the proliferation of cardiac-inducing fast food and fried chicken outlets, you need to do something to try and level the playing field. It’s not exactly King Canute trying to hold back the tide, it’s more Canute, or in this case Vitality, providing everyone (or at least the million or so members of the club) with surfboards to skim across the waves rather than just sit there on your backside getting swamped. “We are making a difference,” says Mayers. “People do go for check-ups and our claims are lower.” The Harvard-inspired theory is working so well that Mayers has now extended it into the realm of investing or saving. You know that other good intention you have, to put a bit aside from your wages for your retirement? And you know how it would be better to start sooner rather than later, ideally in your twenties? “Everyone knows this, but they don’t do it,” says Mayers. Well, guess who is going to give you a gentle nudge in that general direction? Vitality’s persuader in this case is a 20 per cent bonus at the end of it, when you collect your pension payout – providing you’ve behaved well and haven’t started too late or withdrawn it all too soon. Makes sense to me, so much so I suggested it to my two twenty-something sons. They scoffed (as is their wont). “But they are offering all these incentives,” I said. “Maybe they could consider paying off our student debt then,” they said.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It would be funded by a mandatory levy on accounting firms.“We need to build a new house,” Mr Kingman told reporters.KPMG is on the accountancy naughty step again over Ted Baker auditThe new watchdog - the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority - would directly regulate auditors, be forward looking and draw a line under a creaky, leaky, ramshackle and “excessively consensual” FRC perceived to be too close to the Big Four, Mr Kingman said.The new watchdog would also have additional powers to pursue any company director if it found wrongdoing.FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has already said he would step down next year. The board of the new regulator would decide whether to keep on current FRC staff.Separately, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Tuesday published interim findings of its audit market review, which it began a few months ago.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?Carillion: Will watchdogs now finally try to break up big auditors?Deloitte UK admits to substantial BAME gender pay gap “We propose that FTSE 350 audit should be carried out jointly by two firms, at least one of which should be from outside the Big Four,” the CMA said.The subsidiaries of a company would be ided up among the two auditors, with both approving the consolidated accounts.New laws would be needed to implement many of the Kingman recommendations and the CMA proposals, which will be finalised in early 2019.The business ministry welcomed the recommendations, but it may have to hold a public consultation. It faces a parliament clogged by Brexit and a new regulator is unlikely to emerge before 2020.Rachel Reeves, chair of parliament’s business committee, said a new regulator should be able to spot signs of corporate failure and step in before it was too late.“We will take a close eye to the CMA and Kingman recommendations and examine what needs to be done to deliver on these reports,” Ms Reeves said.European Union and British reforms introduced in the past two years to increase audit market competition ended up with companies switching between the Big Four rather than hiring smaller rivals like Grant Thornton or BDO.“These intractable problems may take some years to sort out,” said CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie. “If it turns out that the proposals are not far-reaching enough, the CMA will persist until the problems are addressed.”Mr Kingman said a new regulator would bring an end to current industry self-regulation through professional bodies like the ICAEW. FRC oversight of actuaries should be moved to the Bank of England, he said.In France, joint audits are already common and help smaller accountants like Mazars to break into the top end of the market. Joint audits are estimated to cost about 20 per cent more than having a single auditor.The CMA said if joint audits did not work, a possible alternative would to be ensure that some major audit contracts were only available to non-Big Four accountants - a step the industry proposed in the summer.The CMA stopped short of calling for a break-up of the Big Four but proposed putting their audit and advisory services into separate operating entities.An audit business would have its own board, staff and profit pool for bonuses so it can focus on quality book-keeping.Other recommendations include giving the new regulator powers to intervene in a firm’s audit, and a “duty of alert” that requires auditors to tell the regulator if they have serious concerns about a company’s viability.The CMA recommendations are open for public consultation until mid-January.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.The UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jose Mourinho after he was sacked by Manchester United with immediate effect.

Speaking from Oslo, May says this week\u0027s austerity-easing British budget does not signal an impending electionOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That comes as a free game that is available to players who subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online, which now requires a fee.New version of Nintendo Switch could come next year, report claimsLast year, Nintendo unveiled that it would revive the NES Classic – making many more them after they had initially quickly sold out. That gave hope to fans who longed for the consoles to stick around, and for new games or consoles to be released as well.But Mr\u0026nbspFils-Aime\u0026nbspsaid that the existing two consoles represent extent of our classic program. That suggests there will be no extra consoles, such as the Nintendo 64, which fans have continuously asked Nintendo to reduce into its own miniature system and rumours had suggested may be on its way.And he also ruled out new additions to the Classic consoles\u0027 line-up of games. There\u0027s no ability for add-on content with our classic consoles, so when you purchase the console it’s coming with that set roster of content, he said.But he did point out that new games have been added to the Switch\u0027s set of NES games, suggesting more might come through that service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The responsibility of cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them.”The prime minister’s spokesman did not deny that a managed no deal scenario, and the idea of indicative votes were discussed by ministers. Brexit-backing Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has been a main critic\u0026nbspof fellow ministers – including Amber\u0026nbspRudd\u0026nbspand Greg Clark – who have suggested the votes could take place in the Commons to ascertain\u0026nbspwhat options can be taken forward.Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group, welcomed the cabinet’s announcement of accelerated planning, saying: “Regardless of the\u0026nbsppolitics\u0026nbspwe are 101 days away from Brexit, very close in business planning terms. It’s crucial that businesses have their contingency plans firmly in place.“We continue to work very closely with Government to prepare for a range of different Brexit scenarios. The UK’s ports, many of which already successfully handle large quantities of non-EU trade, are ready to provide a range of options for supply chains.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In Beijing, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry told reporters: “Due to historical reasons, neighbouring countries in Asia and the international community have long been highly concerned about Japan’s moves in military and security fields.”Dr Hoo Chiew Ping, a senior lecturer in strategic studies at the University of Malaysia, said it was “predictable” that China would react negatively to military expansion in Japan, “even though the estimated budget is still not more than 0.9 per cent of Japan’s GDP”.\u0026nbspShe described the purchase of 105 conventional F-35s and 42 F-35Bs as “definitely the highlight” of the budget – each F-35 costs about 10 billion yen (£70bn).Analysts are agreed that the Japanese public is generally averse to greater militarism. Polling earlier this year suggested that less than 40 per cent of Japanese citizens think the constitution should be amended under Mr Abe.Nonetheless, particularly with talks over North Korea’s denuclearisation stalling, “there is growing understanding in Japan of the regional military challenges”, said Dr Alessio Patalano, an expert on Japanese military policy at King’s College London.“That is why these changes are presented as the most conservative steps needed to maintain a credible defence posture,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As other leaders said, she was very ­specic about the legally binding text she needed to convince the DUP and her backbenchers to approve the deal.The two-day meeting was actually scuppered by an agreement suddenly being trashed by Ireland and France.Do they have any inkling how much goodwill between our nations they have destroyed with their parlour games over the past ½ years  How many once pro-EU Brits they convert into Leavers with every new salvo Do they not grasp how mistrustful, obstructive and even hostile we would become as an EU member , God forbid, Remain won a second referendum Senior Cabinet ministers including Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt are rightly imploring Mrs May to focus every effort on No Deal preparations.

The common thread being his unassailable conviction, despite every single catastrophic mistake, that Tony always knows best.Many of us stopped listening long ago.

That would not have changedshe lost and the Tories picked a new leader.And whatever Jeremy Corbyn says, it wouldn’t changethere was an election and he moved into Number  either.You can’t rule anything out for certain, but most MPs reckon an election is the most unlikely outcome of all.That’s why calling a vote of confidence in the government is a waste of time. Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May. In fact, in a two-horse race, he comes a distant third behind don’t know.Jeremy seems to think he could negotiate to stay in the single market and customs union, but stop paying our contributions and still have a say over the rules. Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

W. Bush would have been briefed on the extra-terrestrial presence to whatever extent he so desired.There is no clear evidence George H. W. Bush wanted Disclosure. That said, it is my view the military intelligence complex would have been quite comfortable with Disclosure taking place during a second term of President George H. W. Bush.He would have been the ideal Disclosure President from their perspective. The Cold War was over and the door was now open to end a very expensive and complex truth embargo.While director of the CIA, Bush is said to have even blocked former president Jimmy Carters attempts to obtain UFO information during an alleged briefing on November , .Bush told the president-elect he didnt have the need to know buthe wanted information he should ask the Congressional Research Serviceto prepare a briefing for the new administration.Carter had pledged he would disclose to US citizens what the government knew about UFOselected after witnessing a strange light while governor of Georgia in .Bassett, the executive director of UFO campaign group Paradigm Research Group, thinks Bush rebuffed Carter as he knew some UFOs were extra-terrestrial in origin.He said: We do know the newly elected President Carter approached CIA Director Bush regarding a study the White House wished to initiate regarding the extra-terrestrial issue.Bush declined to cooperate and referred him to another agency. This may have guaranteed he would not be able to stay on as CIA Director - or not.Carter fired him shortly thereafter. One might ask, If there was no truth to the extra-terrestrial hypothesis, why would Bush disrespect a presidential request While campaigning with his son Jeb Bush in the s, Bush was asked about UFOs by a journalist. He replied: Americans cant handle the truth.Bush was also quizzed by UFO researcher Charles Huffer during a presidential rally trip to Rogers, Arkansas, in  during which he asked Bush: Will you tell the people the truth about UFOs Bush replied: Yeah.we can find it, what it is. We are really interested. When pressed further Bush replied: I know some. I know a fair amount.Bush also supported space exploration, and was once quoted in a speech as saying: We will travel to neighbouring stars, to new worlds, to discover the unknown.Bassett, who organised the Citizens Hearings in  - which saw dozens of military, government and intelligence officers give evidence about UFOs to six former members of Congress - believes Bush was also aware of the infamous Roswell UFO crash in July .He added: It is my view Bush was quite knowledgeable about the history of the extra-terrestrial presence to the extent he required. Did that include the July  Roswell events  Almost certainly yes.Last year Bushs son George appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live show to plug his autobiography but remained tight-lipped when asked about UFOs.Kimmel said: This is a question I think is very important to me and very important to the country.When you were in office - and I dont know when this ever orit happened - did you go through the secret files, the UFO documents  BecauseI was president that would be the first thing I did.But instead of laughing off the question or branding Kimmel a crackpot, the former US leader replied: Maybe.He then went on to reveal his daughters Barbara and Jenna asked him the same question when he served as the rd President of the United States but he couldnt tell them anything.Bush was one of three former presidents and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, to go on Kimmel to discuss the UFO topic.Barack Obama, Hillary and Bill Clinton have all previously spoken out about UFOs on the show.Hillary vowed to launch a probeshe made it to the White House but she was pipped by Donald Trump.And Hillary’s campaign manager John Podesta, Bill’s former Chief of Staff, has called for the lid to be lted on UFOs.In , he tweeted his biggest regret after leaving his job as President Obama’s advisor was “once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files.”President Trump recently announced plans to launch a US Space Force by  - some insiders believe it is in response to a hostile alien threat. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was baffled.The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus.The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard.I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper.Then last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise.I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds.I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was.It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak.Nobody has yet proved that the Loch Ness Monster is real – but that certainly hasn’t stopped people trying.Many pictures claiming to show Nessie have been exposed as pranks, with others explained away as a case of mistaken identity.The surgeons photograph, snapped by Colonel Robert Wilson in , is probably the most famous Nessie sighting ever. It was later exposed to be a hoax.Wilsons snap ignited curiosity around the Loch Ness Monster and led to a spate of sightings, such as this picture taken from Fort Augustus on the lochs southern tip.George Edwards took this stunning picture of Loch Ness in , claiming that he had finally found definitive proof of the giant creatures existence.A year later, the boat skipper admitted he had made the whole thing up.The image was created with a fake fibreglass model of Nessie from a National Geographic documentary, and Edwards had even let many of the tourists he ferries around the loch in on his prank.In , a satellite photo on the Apple Maps app seemingly showed a ft shape swimming in the loch.The mysterious outline sparked renewed interest in Nessie after a lull of several years, with the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club claiming it was likely to be the camera-shy monster.However, experts insisted it was merely a boat and its wake.In September , amateur photographer Ian Bremner took this photo from the banks of the loch.His friends claimed it showed three seals playing together, but the whisky warehouse worker suggested it could be Nessie.I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw.It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd.All I will say is that,I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!The image was today accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.The previous sightin was recorded by an American tourist who saw a dark green object protruding . feet above the water on November .According to Google there are , searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster, which is estimated to be worth £million to the region."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vlc_2018-12-17-07h26m05s162.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle sister samantha blasts royal","story":"Samantha let loose on her Royal sister a day after dad Thomas Markle revealed he hadnt heard from the duchess since she married Prince Harry.The -year-old revealed he had been texting his -year-old daughter everyday, and still held out hope their relationship would be rekindled by the time she welcomed her first baby in the Spring of next year.Speaking to Good Morning Britain, the dad said: There has to be a place for me.

I can play as well.I have become more agile than before. I like playing football too.I can walk km with my friends and every afternoon I play football with them.”The lad explained that he wants “to be a professional footballer. My favourite football club is Liverpool FC and my favourite player is [Brazilian] Roberto Firmino. I want to play like him.He was born at home via natural birth and weighed a normal lbs, but began to pack on the pounds at an abnormal weight from the age of two.Arya’s parents took him to several doctors in their village, but surprisingly, doctors did not find anything abnormal about his alarming weight gain.The couple even had to borrow money from their neighbours and relatives to feed their ever-hungry child as their meagre monthly salary of £ wasnt enough to buy sufficient food for Arya.At nine years of age, Arya was so big that he couldnt attend classes as walking to the school was an uphill task for him.His ever-growing giant frame meant no clothes fitted him, so he had to spend his days draped in a sarong and sitting inside a tiny pool to cool himself down.His massive diet became an even bigger worry for his parents, mum Rokayah Somantri, , and dad Ade Somantri, , as he ate five times a day.The little boy could chomp through enough rice, fish curry, beef, vegetable soup and Tempeh - a traditional soy patty - to feed two adults for a whole day.His helpless parents were so worried they put him on a strict no-sugar diet to control him from further bloating.After undergoing bariatric surgery in April last year, the operation helped him initially reduce his weight from st to st in just three weeks.And thanks to a dieticians advice and a fruit and veg-laden diet, Arya has been steadily losing weight and aims to hit his target weight of st.Dad-of-two and farmer Ade said: We have been giving him the food that doctors have recommended.We dont give him prohibited foods. He is not allowed to eat sweets or sweet drinks. He is strictly off sugar.Arya is now very active and plays with his friends. He even goes for a walk with his friends.His sleeping habits have also improved. Earlier he would complain of shortness of breath and troubles sleeping but now he has sound sleeps.Arya has also learnt to ride a motorbike.However, he only takes it out occasionally as he is too young to ride it.Ade explained: Arya can ride a motorcycle now. He is preparing for junior high school but the school is very far away from our home – about  km – and there is no public transport, so he will ride a motorbike to school.In the past Arya used to be best in the class but then his studies were interrupted [because of the weight-related problems].I am glad that Arya is going to school like an ordinary child. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

If everything goes to plan the date for Brexit is March  . There is still a chance the process could be halted or delayed or we could crash out a without a deal. But assuming the Government is still aiming for that date then it faces a race against time to get the UK ready for le outside the EU. These are the major challenges which lie ahead.  The Prime Minister was forced to pull a Commons vote last week on her Brexit plan. This is because so many Conservative MPs and the DUP are unhappy with the Irish backstop. The backstop says thatno other solution can be found then the whole of the UK will remain in the EU’s orbit to prevent aof a hard border in Ireland. Mrs May is frantically trying to get further concessions from Brussels to assure MPs the backstop will be time limited and only used as a last resort. But as EU leaders have been adamant they will not reopen talks on the Withdrawal Agreement the Prime Minister is unlikely to get a legally-binding concession.  The Prime Minister has promised that she will submit her Brexit plan for a Commons vote in the week beginning January . MPs will be asked to vote on two papers: the Withdrawal Agreement which sets out the terms of our orce and the Future Partnership which offers a route map towards a new trading relationship between the UK and the EU. As it stands, the Prime Minister is still facing a defeat. The motion could also be amended by MPs who could demand the extension of Article  to allow negotiations to run into extra time a softer Brexit such as the Norway option or a second referendum.  Supposing Mrs May’s deal does scrape through Parliament the Government then has just a few weeks to get the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament. This legislation would enshrine the Withdrawal Agreement in law. It will set out in detail the government’s agreement on Northern Ireland, the role of the courts and the payment of the orce bill. It could be voted down or amended by the Commons and the House of Lords. Normally such legislation takes six months to get through both Houses of Parliament. Ministers could face a war of attrition with backbench MPs and peers with the clock ticking at an increasingly rapid rate.  There are an estimated  statutory instruments on Brexit which need to go through Parliament. These allow ministers to ram new laws through the Commons and the Lords without the usual scrutiny. Normally, it is for minor things such as permission for a new road scheme. Because of the scale of the task ministers are using Henry V powers - named after the Tudor king who ruled by proclamation - to rush through laws without MPs having a say. Parliamentary experts say many of the necessary laws could be introduced after we leave as long as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is passed. Butwe face crashing out without a deal then primary legislation will be needed urgently on everything from immigration, trade, financial services, fisheries and haulage permits. Don’t forget the EU has the final say  It is not just the UK which has to agree the Brexit deal. The Withdrawal Agreement also has to be approved by the European Parliament. Once a deal has been approved by the UK Parliament it will be voted on by the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and then sent to MEPs for approval. To pass it requires the backing of the majority of MEPs present on the day. If it is ratied by the European Parliament it then passes to the European Council - the  heads of state of EU members. To get through the European Council it needs the support of at least  member states representing at least two-thirds of the EU population. We are not just dealing with Brussels  As a member of the EU the UK has  treaties with other countries. These all need to be “rolled over” before we leave. These includes  free trade deals with countries such as South Korea, Mexico, Canada and Japan and hundreds of side agreements on everything from aviation rights, nuclear exports to the licensing of medicines. So far only a couple of dozen of these  international treaties have rolled over. And that is not the end of the story  Even when we leave we still need to work out future trading partnership with the EU. Few believe the government will be able to achieve this during the transition period which ends in December . It took eight years for the EU to agree a free trade deal with Canada and that did not include services - % of the UK economy. Brexit is going to take several years to resolve.

HMRC is this week sending , emails to businesses and traders who will be particularly affected by leaving without a deal, on customs, excise and regulatory changes.   However, No  said that Theresa May was still focusing on pressing ahead with her beleaguered Brexit deal. “They agreed that delivering the deal remains the Government’s top priority and best mitigation against no deal,” the PM’s spokesman said. “This is sensible Government making sure the public are prepared for all scenarios.” The spokesman denied that the announcement was intended to focus the minds of MPs on the doomsday scenarios that could unfoldthe UK leaves without a deal, or to put pressure on the EU.  He insisted that full implementation of no deal preparations was about “good, sensible planning” and that “other considerations don’t come into it”. The Prime Minister pressed the button on the  technical advice notices which will kick off the full range of preparations for leaving with no deal. Government documents warn No Deal could prompt shortages of fuel, food, medicine and water. And the technical notices state it could ground flights, bring in extra airport checks and slap a nine-month export wait on farmers. Travellers could be forced to renew their passportsthey are less than six months from expiry, and pet owners would have to apply months in advance to go on holiday. Theresa May agreed a -page deal with Brussels to avoid all this - but MPs are refusing to back it because it could extend EU customs rules over the UK indefinitely.  No  insisted there would be an “orderly roll-out” of information through a series of channels. Civil servants will be working through Christmas to deliver the plans. The Treasury will release another poundbn for no deal planning, allocated to inidual departments, bringing the total funding to poundbn. Emergency legislation including bills on trade, immigration and fisheries will have to be rushed through the Commons in just a few weeks in the event of no deal. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay confirmed the tempo of guidance from Government to businesses and households on how to prepare for a no-deal exit from the EU would increase. We need to get over to business that this is something they have to prepare for, he said. Mr Barclay said planning for a no-deal Brexit needs to be much more of a priority for businesses up and down the country. The Governments priority remains to secure a deal, but we need to recognise with  weeks to go, that a responsible government is preparing for the eventuality that we leave without a deal, he said.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but its deadlocked and faces defeat in the House of Commons. Theresa May, facing two no confidence challenges, was forced to delay a vote until at least January . So as time runs out, plans are now being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has triggered  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Officials are sending out thousands of letters to firms and have , troops held at readiness in the event they are needed. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and likely have stockpiles of food and medicine at the stroke of pm.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business and Brexit. Instead we have looked through the governments documents - primarily the  notices - to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But ministers are telling you to brace for them anyway...  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament, butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea.

But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.” Early December: Theresa May tours UK and G with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  January : By this point Theresa May mustto Parliament and make a statementshe still has no agreement. MPs then vote on a motion based on the government statement  days later.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here.  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit, the government said. The Armed Forces personnel are split between fully-employed service people and reserves, the Defence Secretary said. Gavin Williamson told MPs a request has not formally been received yet, but what we are doing is putting contingency plans in place. And what we will do is have , service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  A major motorway is being closed overnight for more than a month in the run-up to Christmas so it can be turned into a lorry park in case of a no-deal Brexit . Highways England began preparations in October for the M in Kent to be used as a holding area for lorriesthere is gridlock at ports like Dover. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

This sht towards greener, more energy efficient cars means there will also be a sht in energy demand – from traditional \u2028fossil fuels to grid electricity. This affects everything, from the price of power to the environmental impact of car charging. Britain’s energy infrastructure will also need to be smarter to ensure that it can meet the challenges of millions of people using electric vehicles. Britain is already on a mission to revolutionise the consumer’s relationship with energy, with the smart meter rollout. Smart metering will support the electric vehicle revolution by affecting when energy is used, as well as how much is needed.  Smart meters also pave the way for new energy tarfs which will reward drivers with cheaper powerthey charge off-peak. They could also enable EV owners to be even more environmentally friendly, by matching charging with the greenest electricity on the system. Purchases of pure electric vehicles , such as the Nissan Leaf or Tesla Model S, look set to increase as environmentally-aware consumers change their purchasing habits. Industry analysts think that environmental concerns are behind the fact that diesel registrations dropped by a quarter in May . Fast chargers  EVs emit no tailpipe emissions, meaning less air pollution in towns and cities. They can be charged at home or at a public charging point and ‘fast chargers’ can now be found in most petrol stations and many public car parks. Easy to drive, with no gearbox to speak of, EVs offer good power at low speeds. They can also prove to be more economical too, with the cost of running one predicted to add around only a quarter to your residential electricity bill, far lower than the costs of a petrol car. Some have pointed to charging arrangements as being a factor in whether to ‘go electric’, with reports of dferent connectors by dferent carmakers cited.  In November , Bill Wiggin MP proposed introducing the Electric VehiclesBill to the House of Commons. This bill aims to standardise the connector types, payment and charging process for EVs. President of the Automobile Association Edmund King described the proposal as: “a welcome move and a breath of fresh air”. He pointed out that while payment is an issue, with dferent cards and apps used by dferent providers, there is a growing standardisation of connectors across the UK and Europe. Energy use  The trend towards an electric motoring future seems set to continue, which is why being in total control of your energy use makes sense. Requesting a smart meter from your energy supplier and using it to review your gas and electricity consumption is an easy way to make the right kind of impact on your wallet, and it could help you reduce your carbon footprint. The smart meter in-home display will also make it easier to be aware of the real cost of your electric vehicle’s fuel usage – putting you firmly in the driving seat.

Taylor-Jay Ravicini was struck by a foam projectile when he was just three, causing him to lose sight in his left eye. In a freak accident, the boy was once hit again in the same eye by a stray nerf foam pellet earlier this year.Worried doctors were forced to remove his eyeball after growing concerned that an infection could spread to his other healthy eye, Wales Online reported .Taylor was hospitalised for six-weeks following his operation due complications because of infections.His mother Stacey Anne, , from Swansea , looks back at the situation with anger and describes it as an utter disaster.They are now fundraising for a new prosthetic eye for the youngster - hoping that it will not draw the attention of other students or strangers. Speaking about the first incident, she said: It was a freak accident. I was there with my three children and everything just happened in a flash.  I didnt know what to do so I called a taxi as there were no ambulances available and took him to Morriston Hospital, who then transferred him to Singleton Hospital. The family were told Taylor had a scratch in his eye but the true extent was revealed when specialist doctors in Bristol confirmed he had been blinded.He had a number of infections so we had to stay in Bristol for six weeks, where he was being operated on. It was tough knowing hed be blind in one eye but we just got on with it, we had no choice, said Stacey. It really affected his confidence, especially in school as he cant take part in sports. At home we continue to support him and tell him how beautul he is. At home he has many bumps and bruises, where hell walk into things. Its so painful seeing him like this but I dont want him blaming himself. I blame myself but Im not a bad mother, it was just a freak accident.  Taylor has been blind in his left eye for the last six years but the second incident this year left him needing a prosthetic eye. He was at home with family and friends when someone shot a toy gun at his damaged eye, injuring it even further. Stacey added: I was downstairs plaiting hair while the kids were playing upstairs. I heard a devastating scream and my heart sunk, I couldnt even go to see him, I sent my partner as I knew something had happened. His eye was full of blood, leading to a build up of pressure in his eye. A specialist told the family Taylor risked losing sight in both eyes, and had no option but to remove the damaged one. Wherever we go people are staring at him and whispering about his eye. In school he is constantly bullied and people call him, popeye, that really hurts, why should he be treated dferent  Stacey said the incidents had taken a huge toll on her le and her anxiety levels were constantly high.  I really dont want people thinking I am a bad mother, she said. What are the chances of an accident happening twice in the same eye  I am constantly worrying for him and what will happen next, it has just been one big emotional rollercoaster. My anxiety is through the roof, Im depressed but Ive got to get on with things. I hope people understand how much he needs this prosthetic eye. Stacey is now travelling to Nottingham with Taylor to see a private ocular prosthesis specialist to get a more realistic prosthetic eye made for him.She has set up a Gofundme page to help raise pound, to make it possible."},{"url":null,"title":"charity refuses donations fundraising event","story":"NewsCharity refuses donations from fundraising event after participants black upA small number of people at Cuddles annual fancy dress event in Old Colwyn, north Wales, on Sunday were pictured in deeply offensive outfitsShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video charity-forced-apologise-after-people-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA charity has refused donations from a fundraising event after some guests blacked up in deeply offensive outfits. Shocking video and pictures have emerged from the Old Colwyn annual fancy dress event in Wales, at which a number of men arrived with their faces covered in black make up. The event was a fundraiser for Cuddles, a charity which supports the Special Care Baby Unitat Glan Clwyd Hospital nearby. But the charity hit out at the costumes, saying they were highly objectionable and claim the photos have caused considerable distress to parts of the community. And as a result, Cuddles has chosen not to accept the fundraisers donation, a move which in turn has led to a backlash.  Are you affected by this story  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  In a statement shared on Facebook, the charity said: On Sundayit was brought to our attention by multiple members of the public that a number of iniduals taking part in the fancy dress event had chosen to wear ‘costumes’ that were highly objectionable, and deeply offensive. Whilst we appreciate that the event organisers may not have been involved in this, photographs circulated on social media by the iniduals concerned, and their comments accompanying them, have caused considerable distress to the people that have been in touch with us. We too were incredibly dismayed to see the photographs. But the decision has disappointed a number of people in the town, some of whom jumped to the mens defence.  Quentin Bellamy, vicar of Old Conwyn, wrote: I have to say that I am extremely dismayed to read this. The people involved in this annual charity event are good, kind, sensitive and caring and GENEROUS IN SPIRIT. Your lecture above is a huge insult to our community, and there needs to be an examination of conscience on the part of Cuddles, and a swt about-turn. His comment has been liked by more than  people. Another poster wrote: Such a shame, I believe they didn’t intend to cause any offence.The charity is very close to the organisers hearts. The lads try really hard year after year to put a good show on and raise money for a worthy cause. North Wales Police confirmed the force received no reports of hate crime at or after the event.

The elf has seen certain colleagues argue with Santa in the middle of the grotto and another who had to leave for taking too much of an interest in the mothers bringing their children along. There was even one particularly aggressive argument centred on one elf refusing to give Santa his gloves and glasses back. Its not just fellow-elves who can make grotto work challenging - parents complaints can cause a real strain as well.   The source said: “Usually an angry parent won’t express themselves with Santa Claus, even the most furious parents know they’d be ruining Christmas for the kidsthey did. “They’ll take themselves to the managers afterwards and try to blag themselves a gt for free. Usually, the managers are happy to alleviate the situation by offering a refund because that sort of mood doesn’t help the atmosphere for everyone  who’s there.”   When they are feeling taken in by the magic of meeting Santa, some children can end up coming out with some fairly outlandish requests. When customers children start listing impossible presents, its down to the stores staff to tactfully manage their expectations. The source added: “You hear requests for all sorts of presents. Unicorns, horses and dogs are popular. Especially horses, you get loads of children asking for them. “Santa deals with it easily though. He tells the children he will have to see what the elves have got and can’t make them any promises. “You do also get those moments when someone asks for, say, a toy motorbike and their parents are going mad, asking why they want a motorbike when all they’ve been talking about is a car. “The children draw pictures for Santa too and it’s lovely and they want to talk him through their whole list but you have to be careful that time doesn’t run over or that queue will start building up again.”   The amount of time each child gets to spend with the big man needs to be strictly controlled - otherwise queues can get out of hand and customers can start getting irate. On the last Saturday before Christmas, the source said Santa often has to enforce a two-and-a-half minutes per child rule. But for all the hiccups, queues and long hours the helpers endure in the weeks leading up to the big day, the good times far outweight the bad. “It is a brilliant time,” says our elf. “The kids are so happy and it really is just magical.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dying man leaves 14 years","story":"NewsDying man leaves  years of Christmas presents for neighbours little girlOwen Williams was shocked to discover his elderly neighbour, Ken Watson, lined up years of presents for toddler Cadi before he diedShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsKen adored two-year-old Cadi \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family were shocked to discover their elderly neighbour had wrapped  years worth of Christmas presents for their two-year-old daughter before he passed away.

We both welled up at the door because it was a lovely sentiment. It was like something from a Christmas movie. He was very fond of Cadi and gave her a Christmas present every year. Her first was a lovely cuddly soft toy, which he bought for the whole street as well.

Lewis Openshaw complained on social media that a big fat sweaty f with a hairy chin with a minging face was sat next to him. He accused his neighbour of smelling like raw onions in his shocking post. Lewis had paid extra for a window seat on his flight to Tunisia on Friday but was seemingly dismayed to find the passenger sat next to him. The -year-old security company director posted the abusive status while waiting on the tarmac at Manchester and called the woman a big sweaty fat f with a hairy chin with a minging face. Holidaymaker Lewis soon took a picture of the poor lady without her realising and shared it publicly after being egged on by pals who commented on his posts. Lewis, who had bragged about getting a fresh start on his holiday, then went on to claim that his flight was full of j*******s [racial slur] and fatties.  UK charity Helping Overcome Obesity Problems [HOOP] branded the comments weight stigma and warned it could lead to depression, anxiety, self harm and even suicidal thoughts in the intended victims. Lewis, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, wrote in his first post: Just my fing luck. I pay extra for a window seat on a row with no one on. So sit down now a big fat sweaty f with a hairy chin with a minging face like shes headbutted a flaky cheese and bean pasty from Greggs and she stinks of raw onions comes and sits next to me. Fright off. When a friend laughed at the post, Lewis replied: Im fing fuming mate. Cant even put my arm on the arm rest cause of her x biceps.  Another pal asked him to take a photo of her to share and Lewis replied: I will when shes asleep. Shell t me. Shes a right lump of lard. Less than an hour later he shared an image of the woman appearing to be sleeping next to him with her hand on face - to the delight of his friends. Lewis, who uses the name Lewis Opey on social media, said: Ladies and gentleman, I introduce [to] you the culprit! [Name] the lump of lard. It is unclearthe name used by Lewis was the actual name of the passenger or not. When Lewis eventually arrived in Tunisia and shared photographs of his hotel, friends asked him where his bird was orshe was eating to build up some energy. Dr Stuart Flint is senior research fellow in public health and obesity at Leeds Beckett University and is one of the directors of HOOP.  Dr Flint, who specialises in weight stigma and discrimination and the psychosocial effects of obesity, said: It is exactly like playground bullying. You can see from some of the emojis used [by Lewis and his friends] that it is perceived as quite comical asit is a joke. Fat jokes are perceived as acceptable. In terms of impact [on the victim of the abuse], the first thing I would say is the impact is great. [I would say to anyone thinking about posting something online like Lewis did], no matter what the subject, stigma discrimination is not acceptable. It doesnt have to be just about weight. You have to think about the impact on the person. It can be quite vast and very serious. It could impact their mental and physical health but also self-harming and suicidal thoughts. You have to think about how you behave and treat dferent people.  Dr Flint explained that while many people believe that negative comments about weight might inspire people to try to lose weight, studies had proved the opposite. Dr Flint said: We know people [after experiencing weight stigma] will then avoid health care or engaging in physical activity or exercise. So it possibly makes it worse. We know that weight stigma is very pervasive. People have these types of experiences almost daily across a range of settings. They are being reported more in public settings such as on public transports, probably because of social media. It is being highlighted more. There needs to be greater restrictions on social media and throughout in terms of weight stigma and discrimination. If this was another topic that someone was being stigmatised for or treated the way this lady was treated then there would be repercussions. The social media [] would have intervened and depending on the topic it might even go further, such as legal or whatever.

Speaking to Good Morning Britain he said: Im very disappointed by it. Im not sure why its happening and Im waiting, Im reaching out. I would appreciate anything she could do. I would think she would want to resolve family problems. All families, royal or otherwise, are the same and they should all be together – certainly around the holidays. Palace sources said the royal household had become enraged and yet exhausted with Thomas and believe he has gone a step too far by trying to draw the Queen into the row. A senior palace source said: The Queen is a dignied woman. Evenshe disagreed with the way her grandsons we or indeed her staff were dealing with the matter, she would certainly not become involved on this level.

The Duchess of Sussex is reportedly planning to take a relatively short maternity leave before heading back to her homeland for a Royal Tour of America and Canada - taking Baby Sussex with her. A source told Vanity Fair that staff are in the early stages of planning. Dates are not known and will all depend on when the baby arrives, which is also being kept a secret, but the source believes it will be in the autumn.  The couple were reportedly due to visit the countries in the spring, but this was postponed when Meghan fell pregnant. Meghan is likely to be keen to carry out the tour as the countries are very important to her. Shes from America and spent a lot of time living in Canada when she was filming her TV show Suits. Meghan is due to give birth to her first baby in the spring, but after seeing photos of her baby bump from her most recent outing many fans believe it may be sooner.  The parents went on their first Royal Tour earlier this year, spending  days exploring Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji. They had a packed schedule for the trip, including trips to the rainforest, swapping stories in an anti-bad vibes circle and climbing Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The Duchess of Sussex, , is visiting the Royal Variety Charitys residential nursing and care home in Twickenham, south-west London, to meet retired artists and entertainers. The former actress, wearing a dress by Brock Collection and a coat by Soia and Kyo, has met residents in the dining room. She will later sing Christmas carols and take part in craft sessions at Brinsworth House, Kensington Palace said. Meghan was seen chatting to actress Mona Hammond who played Blossom Jackson in EastEnders in the s. She also talked to Richard O’Sullivan, star of s sitcoms Man About the House and Robin’s Nest. And later Meghan helped decorate Christmas artwork. She made a bauble-shaped decoration, on which she signed her name in red.  But it comes days after her father Thomas Markle claimed he was being shunned by her - sparking crisis talks amid reports the royal household has become enraged by Mr Markles behaviour. In the th century, Christmas turkeys walked from East Anglia to London with their farmers - and the journey took three months. But the trip was so hard on the birds feet they were given little leather boots. For more fun facts and trivia tune in as Christmas on Dave continues tonight at :pm with a QI Christmas Special.  Meghans desperate dad also claimed he had not spoken to him for months and she did not reply to his daily text messages. Mr Markle made a direct appeal to the Queen to help heal the growing rt between him and his daughter during an interview with Good Morning Britain on ITV on Monday. The retired lighting director said: I love my daughter very much and she has to know that.   I would really appreciateshe would just call me, reach out to me somehow, send me a text, just say youre there and youre hearing me. But the  residents at Brinsworth House enjoyed the festive activities today, including arts and crafts sessions and carols around the Christmas tree. Its Meghans last official engagement before Christmas. Giles Cooper, the charitys chairman, welcomed the royal. He said: The timing of the visit is fantastic as it comes a few weeks after the Royal Variety performance which she attended with Prince Harry.   And it comes after her wedding, which all the residents here were watching. We had the television on, Union Jack bunting up and a party atmosphere - so its nice to have the bride here. The Sussexes, meanwhile, recently turned down the chance to live next to William and Kate at Kensington Palace. It led to reports of a rt between the couples, reportedly fuelled by a ghastly row between Meghan and Kate. The Royal Variety Charity, which the Queen supports as patron, assists those who have worked professionally in the entertainment industry and are in need of help and assistance as a result of old age, ill health, or hard times. Many can spend long periods with no work and with little ability to make plans for their futures, or to provide financial security should they have an accident or fall ill.  The pregnant duchess is a former actress who, with her husband Harry, attended the Royal Variety Performance in November when acts on the bill included the West End cast of the hit musical Hamilton, chart topper George Ezra and singer Andrea Bocelli and his son Matteo. Brinsworth House is decorated to emphasise its theatrical lineage, representing the retired artists and entertainers who have been supported there over the years. Among other famous entertainers who have been cared for at the residential home are Sir Norman Wisdom, Dame Thora Hird and EastEnders actor Leslie Grantham.

Nicky Boothroyds son Patrick, , plunged to his death while climbing Britains highest mountain in the Scottish Highlands. The student from West Yorkshire was joined by a fellow male climber near the top of Tower Gully when an overhanging ledge of snow collapsed on them. Examiner Live reports that a huge rescue operation was launched during the incident on Sunday and members of Lochaber mountain rescue team located the pair. They were airlted to Belford Hospital in Fort William but Patrick, who lived in Honley but was studying at Cardf University, died from his injuries. Miraculously, his friend survived with only minor injuries and has now been discharged from hospital.   Nicky, a married primary school teacher, who also has a -year-old daughter and a -year-old son, said: It was about .pm on Sunday when two police officers came to the door. It was a big shock. We knew he was climbing in Scotland. The night before he had texted me to say he was going to look at the ice conditions on Ben Nevis. He was vice-president of the mountaineering club at Cardf. There were eight of them, all lads, they were staying at Fort William and were in high spirits. He had been doing it virtually from the moment he was born. My husband Nigel and my eldest son Phil drove up there yesterday. They went to see all the mountain service people and the police officers to thank them for all their efforts. Nigel is a big climber and Patrick was just following in his footsteps. They went climbing a lot together. He got it from his dad. He went climbing all the time, every weekend.   Patrick was amazing and very ambitious. He was studying Geology and was on course for a First Class degree. He was hoping to do a Masters at Camborne School of Mining in Cornwall. He was going to take a gap year and go an work abroad. He sent a text telling us he had got there safely. We were worried about all the bad weather that there was this weekend. They were just at the top of the mountain and coming to the end of an ice-climbing route. A cornice broke off and fell.His friend called the mountain rescue service. They took quite a while to get to him because he was so high up on the mountain. He was conscious at first and I think he died in the helicopter from a cardiac arrest. He was just amazing, he was brilliant. He had a lot of close friends and he was very ambitious for the future. He wanted to be a geologist and travel the world. In previous summers he had gone to work in Greenland, Japan and America. He wanted to see the world. He had climbed in the Alps and the Dolomites where he spent three weeks with his dad.   He was very safety-conscious and had been on safety courses in he Alps and had arranged for the rest of the group to have a guide to do some climbing training. He was very much into the environment and did a lot of charity work and slept out in aid of the homeless. He had a girlfriend. They hadnt been together very long but were very close. Patrick was scaling ,ft high Ben Nevis with a fellow climber from Cardf University Mountaineering Club, who survived the same plunge with just a couple of broken bones. Sergeant Michael Bell of Police Scotland said: Our thoughts are with the mans friends and family at this very sad time. There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal in due course. I would take the opportunity to thank the crew of the HM Coastguard helicopter and Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team for their assistance with this incident. Donald Paterson, deputy leader of Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, said: The cornice snow was soft and had no real purchase so it started moving. It just collapsed on them as they came through the cornice. The snow was not enough to bury them but large enough to carry them down the mountain. They must have fallen  metres- one walks away with a few cracked ribs, and the other sadly loses his le. Around  members of Lochaber MRT were sent after the alarm was raised at .pm on Sunday, but Mr Paterson and a fellow rescuer reached the pair before the Inverness-based Coastguard search and rescue helicopter airlted them to the Belford Hospital in Fort William. A spokesman for Greenhead College said it would be providing a tribute in due course.

Kyle Gordy, , who currently has  children, said: “If anyone in the UK wants my services I am happy to travel. Id go anywhere to help women out, apart from North Korea or any war zone.” Kyle decided to donate his sperm after a string of failed relationships convinced him that he was not the relationship type but he still had that primal urge to procreate. So he set up a Facebook page offering his services in , and his first attempt resulted in a healthy pregnancy and demand for his sperm has increased ever since. Kyle said: “Im a very, very popular guy.  people hit me up every month. Im in high demand. I cant help everyone but I usually donate to between two and five people every month. I always wanted kids but I get bored in relationships very quickly.  Sperm donation gives me an outlet, I have no pressure to find a girlfriend but I still get to have children. For me, sperm donation is a substitute for having a girlfriend. Speaking about his clients Kyle said that he has sex with  per cent of them – the oldest being  and youngest was just . He said: “One woman in her s has asked me to impregnate her daughter, who is , so that she can adopt the child. Then the following year, her daughter wants to get pregnant with me again so she can keep the baby herself. Im flying out to impregnate her naturally next month. I asked her mumshe would be there too but said she wouldnt be. Kyle promises good looking, super intelligent babies saying: I come from a good family. My dads a lawyer, my mums a programmer and my granddad was a professor at UCLA and a personal friend and colleague of Albert Einstein. So the babies are getting all those law and engineering genes too.”  But his popularity is not without drama with some mums hes impregnated getting angry when friends, family and colleagues also enlist his services. “I get lots of repeat business. Im probably the most popular donor in the world but some women dont understand when they go into this that I will have other kids and I may donate to their friends.” Kyle remembers the first time he donated. “In February, , I met a couple who wanted a kid and I told them I thought I could help them do that. “We spoke for  minutes and met the following week. The couple got pregnant and that kid is now -years-old. “I had a second kid with the same couple who is -months-old now. Kyle said that the majority of his donors take a sample of his sperm and impregnate themselves with a syringe, but about % chose to have sex with him instead. “When we have sex we try to make it fun, he said. Kyle said that he has learned a lot about fertility through the years, and he has condensed this anecdotal experience and personal research into his website BePregnantNow. He does not charge for his services but the donor recipient pays for his travel costs and sexual health teststhey require more than the two a year he arranges himself. He has donated sperm in L.A., San Francisco, Colorado and Texas in recent months and said that he would love to make an extended trip to Britain soon. In Britain, women keen to avoid NHS waiting lists and the hefty private costs of tests, sperm selection and insemination, are increasingly opting for DIY pregnancies, like those offered by Kyle. Some women are turning to Facebook groups where men, who may have no sexual health or genetic screening, offer their sperm for free, a route to pregnancy that could be dangerous for the women and potential offspring, some experts warn. Kyle insists that his service is better than going through a sperm bank. He said that concerns around accidental incest are practically non-existent among his offspring because he has a Facebook group where the families can share photos and stay in touch. “Most women get pregnant the first time with me but Im not a miracle worker. One women who has serious health issues has been trying with me on and off for three years and it hasnt worked yet.  “A sperm bank could use the same guy , times and its hard to track the donor, so the risk of incest is much higher with that. “My contact information is readily available and all the children will be able to easily find each other through me. “In  years time, I can have a big Fathers Day party with them all,” he said. And the sperm donor said that his Jewish heritage gives him an advantage over competitors, granting his offspring access to a free holiday through the organisation Birthright Israel, which pays for young people of Jewish heritage to visit the Mediterranean country. “I dont discriminate on age,” he said, “but I do check that the family is in stable employment and can support a child. “I think every guy has a primal urge to pro-create. Knowing I have children is a satisfaction.  “I think my looks, my education and the area Im in make me a popular sperm donor. I live in Los Angeles, which has an international reputation as a city of influence, and it has a lot of lesbian couples who want to start a family but need sperm to do that. He said that his family has largely supported his sperm donor status but his mum is not entirely convinced and frequently tells him that theyre not really his children because he did not raise them. “Overall, theyve been fine about it though. My brother makes a lot of money and I make a lot of children,” he said.

Disabled Valery Spiridonov, , was ready to have his neck severed by Professor Sergio Canavero - dubbed Dr Frankenstein - and his head reattached to a new, healthy body. But he has changed his mind after starting a family with new love Anastasia Panfilova. Professor Canavero is now working in China where he has received funding for his research while Mr Spiridonov, who became world famous for his readiness to be decapitated for science, has found his own extraordinary new le. The computer expert worked for two years with Dr Canavero but now accepts the doctors first attempts at the futuristic surgery will be on Chinese volunteers rather than him.  Mr Spiridonov has moved to America and is now studying the computer analysis of emotions at the University of Florida. He has revealed that with him are his bride Anastasia - who is in her early s - and the couple’s recently-born son. A picture shows the proud father - who suffers from Werdnig-Hoffman disease, a form of spinal muscular atrophy often leading to low le expectancy - holding his baby. The little boy was born six weeks ago and is healthy, which Mr Spiridonov describes as a “miracle” since the condition can be inherited. Anastasia, who has a masters degree in chemical technology and previously studied in Italy, is not seen in pictures with her husband. But she explained online her love of men in wheelchairs.  She said: “Such people [in wheelchairs] are much deeper, feeling, faithful, kind-hearted, and also they are usually very smart…isn’t that the main thing ” Mr Spiridonov said: “We lived in the same city, and often met on professional matters and soon realised that we felt really good together. “She has several degrees. We got married a little over one year ago in Moscow.” Mr Spiridonov said he is happy with his new le but has challenged Dr Canavero to come clean on his work in China amid a suspicion that the Italians encountered problems with his techniques. “I understood that it was a great risk, that it had never been done before,” he told Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. “But what did I have to lose  I could not lose just a tiny chance to walk normally.”  He claimed there is a lack of information from Dr Canavero on his experimental work in China. “I do not regret it that Canavero did not reach the final goal – or did reach it, and failed,” he said. “This was just a normal working process. “The only thing we lack from him is more publicity. “Everybody would have benefited from information what went wrong in China and why. “I don’t have such information today and it does not help the further research. “I do hope Canavero will publish it in detail one day.”  Instead of becoming a guinea pig, Mr Spiridonov has designed a “smart” wheelchair operated by voice, and is working on consultancy projects. He admitted: “I feel a weight lted off my chest. “I never had a vain motive to become the first. “I gave two years of my le to this project. “I will be glad to see it happening [with someone ].” “I am deeply grateful to Canavero. “Thanks to our joint efforts, a lot is changing for the better, and for me too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"trapped family look helplessly elephant","story":"NewsTrapped family look on helplessly as hungry elephant raids back of their carFreezing in terror, the mum, dad and two teenage boys try to avoid any sudden movements they fear could anger the the large wild animalShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video watch-elephant-raids-back-terried-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA shocked family could only watch as an elephant ransacked their pick-up truck in a desperate search for food.The driver noticed the fully grown male bull foraging through the back of a black Mitsubishi in front of them, at the Khao Yai National Park in Nakhon Ratchasima, southern Thailand, on Sunday, December , at pm.It opened several plastic boxes with its huge trunk before tossing them to the ground and rummaging through in search of food to scoop up with its trunk.

Maybe this season we have had a more inconsistent start than in previous years.“It has just taken that bit longer to get going but at this time of year we always get the results we need.“The one thing for us is to get to the turn of the year and be sitting up there within that top four.“That will give us that  to build upon for the rest of the season.”Aberdeen’s early inconsistent league form has seen them sit under the radar with all the focus on Hearts, Kilmarnock and Rangers being the contenders to put pressure on Celtic.Considine insists he doesn’t care about critics writing them off as all the Dons’ focus has been on rising up the league standings.He said: “Let everyone speak about everyone  at the top of the league.“We just let our football do the talking. We take it game by game and just keep grinding out results.“Sometimes you are not always going to play well. Butyou get the right results and take your chances then you will still climb up the league.“We know what we need to do and we have another huge game against Dundee and that is where our thoughts are.“December was always going to be massive for us and we have four more games to go.“If we can pick up four good results we could be sitting second or third.“That would be a good position going into the New Year.”Considine played a key role in the - win over Premiership bottom club St Mirren. The opening goal came from a penalty awarded for a foul on him.For the winner Sam Cosgrove netted the rebound after Considine’s header hit the bar.The big defender said: “It was instilled into us that we must start on the same note to the way we finished off against Livingston.“That was the message the manager got into us before the game.“It probably took us  or  minutes to get going but we still felt we were in control.“St Mirren had one free-kick and they scored from it.“I haven’t seen it again but I think one of our boys is potentially playing him onside.“I am not too sure because he seems to be standing by himself.”For the second game in succession Aberdeen conceded having taken an early lead.They secured the winner in Paisley through a header from Sam Cosgrove, his second in two games, the striker having also netted in the - defeat of Livingston.Considine said: “In the second half we were straight on the front foot.“We created a number of chances and young Connorwas brilliant, taking on his man, getting to the byline and putting in crosses.“We were putting balls in behind them and trying to stretch their back three.“We managed to get a head to it from the free kick from Nialland thankfully the rebound was put in by big Sam.“I was delighted for him.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"calls for cycle path on aberdeens king street","story":"A competition to design a bike path for a major Aberdeen street has been launched by a city group.The Aberdeen Cycle Forum began the new campaign for King Street, with the hope of hearing ideas from people all over the world.Designs for a segregated bike path are being sought, which would see a separate lane created for cyclists, with a barrier between traffic.Currently there are sections of specic lanes on the busy street, however they are often shared with buses, as is the case on Union Street.Campaigns and community secretary for Aberdeen Cycle Forum Rachel Martin said: “We would love to see King Street transformed into a great place to cycle.“We recognise that designing something is quite challenging so we thought we would open it up to get inspiration from all over the world.”Ideally, the bike path would run the entireof King Street from the Seaton area up to the Castlegate.From there, it would join the proposed bike path on Union Street, which would run up until Holburn Street.In future, it is hoped it could also link to Bridge of Don.Rachel said: “At a minimum, it would run at least from the university to Castlegate which would join the Union Street path and go all the way to Holburn Street.“From there, it’s a little way from the Deeside Way, so we’d like to join them all up.“It’s not continuous on King Street and there’s buses.

We want to bring more to the table. There’ll be people who live in a city where they’ve had similar challenges and will be able to share ideas.”It is thought the new infrastructure would make the city more attractive to students and university staff, helping to attract both groups in the long term.The winning designs will be showcased on the Aberdeen Cycle Forum website as well as being submitted to Aberdeen City Council.There will be a prize for each category, with the winner aged under  receiving a £ voucher, those between  and  years old will get a £ voucher and adults over the age of  will receive a £ voucher.The prizes for the competition have been donated by Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative, where the prizes can be redeemed.Aberdeen Cycle Forum also held a petition earlier this year to see a segregated bike path created on Union Street.The petition will be reviewed as part of Aberdeen City Council’s Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan .To take part in the competition, visit https:kingstreet.awards"},{"url":null,"title":"high speed web work","story":"A series of Aberdeen roads are due to close for internet upgrade work.City Fibre is preparing to deliver superfast broadband to the Granite City, making it one of the first in the country to have the connection.Old Church Road will shut between January  at am and January  at pm, Fernie Brae between January  and  and Kirkhill Road from February  to February .Old Church Road will be closed again between February  and .The closures, which are accompanied by a ban on waiting which will be marked by cones, is to allow for duct work to be carried out by City Fibre.The firm has paired with Vodafone to deliver the service."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt on to find north easts most talented tradespeople","story":"The hunt is on again this year to find the north-east’s most talented tradespeople.The Trades Awards has been launched and businesses across the region are being urged to enter.Sponsored by Stewart Milne Group for the sixth year running,  awards are up for grabs at the prestigious event which is run by marketing agency Mearns  Gill.A spokeswoman for the firm said: “The  Trades Awards are open for applications, with a deadline of Monday February  .“The Trades Awards, which are once again kindly sponsored by Stewart Milne Group, is the largest trades and construction awards ceremony in the north-east, and continues to be the only event of its kind in Scotland.“With  award categories, covering a wide range of business types and sizes, the Trades Awards are open to all trades and construction professionals and businesses across the north-east.”The awards bash will take place next year with interested parties being invited along to a launch event on January  at Trinity Hall.The spokeswoman added: “This event is the perfect opportunity for people to meet with judges, sponsors and previous winners and ask them about their own experiences of the Trades Awards.”Applications to enter an award category can be made at www.tradesawards"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c175d83b7acd-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inspectors praise for north east nursery","story":"A north-east nursery has been praised by inspectors.The Care Inspectorate visited Fyvie Primary School on November  and said in a report: “Staff were respectful and nurturing in their interaction with the children.”They rated the care, support and environment of the nursery as “very good” – the second best of six possible ratings.A parent told inspectors: “Staff are amazing.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The first step of this plan, to redevelop the Egg Shed, is nearing completion.The area around the building has been levelled and the building has been made wind and water tight.With the target completion date of February  nearing, nothing has yet been decided about the building#s use once it has been refurbished and extended. Options include an interpretation centre a local heritage centre an exhibition space community use a training and education centre small scale retail and an external public space.Scottish Canal#s plans go further, with a community pontoon also proposed.There are also plans for Pier Square, with a grand relaunch of The Steamer Terminal in the pipeline. Scottish Canals might also look to move from its office on Pier Square and convert the building to holiday accommodation.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Elliott Summers, , of Bellesleyhill Road, Ayr, was found guilty after trial of the rape of a -year-old woman on July , last year. Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports. During the trial Summers victim told of how they met online and then she visited his cottage. She took a bottle of wine for him and bottled water for herself. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she arrived around .pm to pm and Summers, who was drunk, grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at the door. He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television. Summers, then put his hand inside her bra, made a disparaging comment about her nipples and suggested that she looked older than . She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands. I repeatedly said No, this is not happening.” When Summers fell asleep his terried victim managed to get out of the bed and get dressed. The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes!

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

victims of the fire on June  last year.Mr Brokenshire said the Government had committed to a programme of reform focused on four key areas: introducing more effective regulations and accountability clearer guidance prioritising residents and working with the industry to drive change.The long-awaited response follows recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt in May, which the Government agreed to take forward in full.In her report, she found that indference and ignorance led to a ldquorace to the bottom in building safety practices, recommending the creation of a new regulator.In September, the Government introduced a ban on using combustible cladding on new high-rise homes which is due to come into force on Friday ndash  months after the west London blaze.Part of the new implementation plan, Building a Safer Future, reads: ldquoThe Government accepts the need to create, in law, a tougher regulatory framework, under which regulators will have greater powers and more opportunities to intervene throughout the lecycle of a building.ldquoWe also consider that stronger sanctions and enforcement powers are needed to incentivise compliance and address noncompliance.The campaign group Grenfell United called it a ldquolong overdue shake up of an industry which ldquofor years has put profit over people.While the Governmentrsquos commitments were ldquopromising, the group warned against ldquourgent changes being kicked into the long grass.It said: ldquoA signicant volume of Hackittrsquos recommendations will now go to consultation.ldquoWe must be vigilant to ensure government and industry, that so badly failed us, do not water down these changes.ldquoResident voices must be given weight and parliament must keep a watchful eye on progress.\"Housing Secretary James Brokenshire The anticipated new regulatory framework will apply to multi-occupancy buildings of at least  storeys, with a consultation in the spring  on whether additional buildings should be included.The Government will also consult on proposals to create dutyholders ndash people who will ensure residentsrsquo safety is at the forefront of each stage of a buildingrsquos development ndash in a bid to strengthen accountability.Their responsibilities would be underpinned by regulations that would require ldquogateways at key points where they would have to demonstrate they are ldquoactively managing safety risks.But the London Fire Brigade warned the safety reforms could fail becausethere were not enough building and fire safety people ldquowith the relevant skills and qualications to provide the proper scrutiny.The Government said it will establish a Joint Regulators Groupto help us develop new approaches, assist with the transition to a new regulatory framework and assess resource needs.Grenfell United added: ldquoThe plan to work with existing industry regulators must only be a temporary step to identy, remediate and keep people safe in their homes.ldquoUltimately we need a fully independent regulatory body, with effective sanction and enforcement powers.The LGA welcomed Mr Brokenshirersquos commitment to implement the recommendations, and

the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility

positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish

with our colleagues at Langley Distillery in the Black Country to perfect the drink.ldquoOur goal was to create the smoothest, creamiest vodka in one of the oldest working copper pot stills in the country, inspired by this very traditional recipe.ldquoIrish distillers used oats in the early th century to soften and sweeten the flavour of pot-distilled whiskeys, while there is evidence

with two other grains ndash wheat for lightness and rye for subtle spiciness ndash we believe we have created one of the most perfectly balanced, smoothest sipping vodkas on the market.Oats fell out

said establishing a ldquoradically-new system would be the best tribute for the  victims of the fire on June  last year.Mr Brokenshire said the Government had committed to a programme of reform focused on four key areas: introducing more effective regulations and accountability clearer guidance prioritising residents and working with the industry to drive change.The long-awaited response follows recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt in May, which the Government agreed to take forward in full.In her report, she found that indference and ignorance led to a ldquorace to the bottom in building safety practices, recommending the creation of a new regulator.In September, the Government introduced a ban on using combustible cladding on new high-rise homes which is due to come into force on Friday ndash  months after the west London blaze.Part of the new implementation plan, Building a Safer Future, reads: ldquoThe Government accepts the need to create, in law, a tougher regulatory framework, under which regulators will have greater powers and more opportunities to intervene throughout the lecycle of a building.ldquoWe also consider that stronger sanctions and enforcement powers are needed to incentivise compliance and address noncompliance.The campaign group Grenfell United called it a ldquolong overdue shake up of an industry which ldquofor years has put profit over people.While the Governmentrsquos commitments were ldquopromising, the group warned against ldquourgent changes being kicked into the long grass.It said: ldquoA signicant volume of Hackittrsquos recommendations will now go to consultation.ldquoWe must be vigilant to ensure government and industry, that so badly failed us, do not water down these changes.ldquoResident voices must be given weight and parliament must keep a watchful eye on progress.The anticipated new regulatory framework will apply to multi-occupancy buildings of at least  storeys, with a consultation in the spring  on whether additional buildings should be included.The Government will also consult on proposals to create dutyholders ndash people who will ensure residentsrsquo safety is at the forefront of each stage of a buildingrsquos development ndash in a bid to strengthen accountability.Their responsibilities would be underpinned by regulations that would require ldquogateways at key points where they would have to demonstrate they are ldquoactively managing safety risks.But the London Fire Brigade warned the safety reforms could fail becausethere were not enough building and fire safety people ldquowith the relevant skills and qualications to provide the proper scrutiny.The Government said it will establish a Joint Regulators Groupto help us develop new approaches, assist with the transition to a new regulatory framework and assess resource needs.Grenfell United added: ldquoThe plan to work with existing industry regulators must only be a temporary step to identy, remediate and keep people safe in their homes.ldquoUltimately we need a fully independent regulatory body, with effective sanction and enforcement powers.The LGA welcomed Mr Brokenshirersquos commitment to implement the recommendations, and said it was pleased to be part of the JRG.Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ldquoThe definition of higher risk residential buildings in the Hackitt Review is currently too narrow.ldquoIt must be extended to all buildings in which vulnerable people sleep other than private homes.ldquoConsideration must also be given to lowering the

waste your energy feeling sorry for Theresa May","story":"Irsquom doing pretty well on the domestic front. I didnrsquot, for example, shout and swear as I watched a stranger casually fill my recycling bin with his landfill waste. Instead, I simply cleaned up the bins without complaint, much to my husbandrsquos amazement.:Second Brexit referendum would do irreparable damage, Theresa May warnsMy new found zen does not extend to politics, however, especially after the last weekrsquos disgraceful Brexit developments, following which Irsquom failing miserably to keep calm and carry on. And despite what Irsquove just said about goodwill, I have not one iota of sympathy for Theresa May and her current predicament.Itrsquos interesting, isnrsquot it, how this narrative around feeling sorry for the Prime Minister has grown  The ldquopoor Theresa mantra reached a full head of steam last week, of course, as the extreme Brexiteers in her party finally moved in for the kill with their vote of no confidence, after stalking her for months.In the media coverage during the build-up to Wednesdayrsquos vote, and in the tone of the reaction to her victory, I was struck by the number of folk who went on and on ndash and on - about how sorry they felt for Mrs May.Itrsquos become clear large sections of the public have become increasingly, indeed worryingly, impressed by the Prime Ministerrsquos handling of the Brexit debacle, seeming to view the blank look on her face as a comforting, praiseworthy signal to us, the plebs, that she knows what shersquos doing.Irsquom not fooled for a minuteand neither should you be. Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did the best woman win The Apprentice final ","story":"Yet this th series, which ended with an all-women final last night, has seen the show rejuvenated. Must be something in the water, or the air. Instead of the usual wall to wall numpties, producers opted for a cast studded with good-looking, genial types, several of whom clearly fancy the Calvin Kleins off each other. For Apprentice  think Love Island with spreadsheets.Sex still sells, then, but not always, a lesson that finalist number one, Camilla Ainsworth, the nut milk queen, has been slow to learn. Last week she was told off for advertising her vegan dairy substitute in ways that would have made Hugh Hefner blush.This week the -year-old from Lancashire convened a meeting to name her product. Daniel, one of the sacked crowd brought back for the final, had clearly failed to get the memo about naughty not being nice. ldquoLove nuts was his first suggestion, followed by ldquoGrab my nuts. Lord Sugarrsquos lieutenant, Claude, gave Daniel a stare so hard it could have cracked walnuts.Competing against Camilla for poundk of Sir Alanrsquos money was Sian the reversible swimwear designer . Would she like to call her brand Bikini Hut , or Bikini Bitch  Curiously, the -year-old from Leeds did not. She settled instead for SYO, ldquostyle your own, and asked Kurran to direct the television ad. In a previous attempt at such a task, Kurran turned out to be more Mr Bean than Mr Spielberg, but to everyonersquos amazement he made a decent job of it, evenhe did later compare himself to Scorsese.Both Sian and Camillarsquos products were the sort of thing real people might actually want to buy. This was another bucking of the Apprentice trend. Carry on like this and who knows, this yearrsquos winner might be heard of again, instead of disappearing into television equivalent of the witness protection programme.After the pitch to industry professionals, it was on to the boardroom for the last time, and another miracle: Sir Alan cracked a joke that was on the same continent as funny. Spying Kurran, he teased: ldquoYou got back from Hollywood okay then It came down to this: Camilla had only been in business for three months but her product could potentially bring in big profits. Sian had obvious talent and a proven product, but the market for swimwear was overcrowded. Lord Sugar went for the safer bet, Sian. The Apprentice may be to real business what Peppa Pig is to the farming industry, but Lord Sugar does not mess around with his own money. Thatrsquos why he has so much of it.With on the night audiences averaging  million, The Apprentice still manages to hover around fourth or fth in BBC weekly rankings.

He shows me his wedding ring, which is designed to look like a chain .He also shows me the coat of arms hersquos created for his family featuring a phoenixas well as a flag that stands for idealism. Tibbetts says the flag is a jokey nod towards his love of Doctor Who. If yoursquore true to your ideals, he says, you will never die, you will always be regenerated.:Mark Smith: The danger of lsquocriminalrsquo flags and why Irsquove changed my mind about the Union JackDay to day, Tibbetts main responsibilities at the Court of the Lord Lyon are to help communities create their own flagshe also deals with inquiries from the public and organisations that are interested in creating a flag. The Court of the Lord Lyon, based just off Princes Street, is mainly responsible for recording and protecting coats of arms as well as Scotlandrsquos national symbols , but it is also there to help create new ones. And, according to Tibbetts, there is an increasing interest in doing so.The most obvious example has been communities like Caithness and Orkney creating flags, and Tibbetts thinks there are a number of reasons for this trend. ldquoPartly itrsquos the way the world is, he says. ldquoThe more global the world becomes, the more important it is to understand your place in it. He cites the example of the flag of Barra, which gained prominence after the death of -year-old Eilidh MacLeod in the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in . The flag was draped over Eilidhrsquos coffin when her body was repatriated to the island for her funeral and there is a campaign to have it officially recognised.Tibbetts also believes there is something particular about Scotland that makes us value symbols of identity. ldquoThere are two things in Scotland, he says. ldquoYou have a clan-based sense of identity. Also, there are hundreds of tartans and that has encouraged a deep and healthy sense of identity - Scotland isnrsquot just one thing, it is so many things underneath that build up to make this rich picture. There are a number of places that have a really strong national identity but itrsquos almost like itrsquos built on sand ndash therersquos very little underneath it. Whereas in Scotland it really is built on these strong foundations.Tibbetts sees his job as building on these foundations further and clearly loves what hersquos doing. The -year-old admits to me early on that hersquos always had a geeky interest in heraldry. ldquoIrsquom a massive geek, he says, ldquoand the more I talk, the more like Sheldon Cooper Irsquom going to sound. Growing up in Halesowen near Dudley, he specically remembers falling in love with Doctor Who. ldquoMy parents introduced me to Doctor Who when I was eight hoping it would keep me away from sex, drugs and rock and roll, he says, ldquoBut by the time I was  they were desperately hoping I would start to develop an interest in sex, drugs and rock and roll!Eventually, he moved to Scotland to study philosophy at St Andrews University, where he established a Doctor Who society and met his future we. He also began to develop his interest in heraldry, working on the universityrsquos graphic design team and developing a Tibbetts tartan that he could wear when supporting his we whos a Scottish country dancer. ldquoThat triggered me on to thinking, how do you develop these symbols  he says, ldquoHow do you make them useful :Revealed: the police list of flags that could be criminal offence to fly in ScotlandTibbetts has worked on those questions for about ten years, developing symbols for local communities before he was appointed to his new post at the Lyon Court in August. Hersquos now the go-to man on flags in Scotland, a kind of human wikipedia that you can fire questions at. I give it a try. Which is correct: Union flag or Union Jack  Both are correct, he says. What about the lion rampant ndash whatrsquos the status of that flag  Officially, he says, itrsquos a royal symbol that should only be flown by a representative of the crown. But he says hersquos not about to try to enforce that rule at Hampden on match day.I have another question: how aware is he of the negative side of flags and how do we ensure the symbols he loves donrsquot become a bad influence  Has he ever reflected on the problematic side of flags Of course he has, he says. ldquoItrsquos like any tool ndash it can be mis-used and by making more of tools that can be used negatively, am I doing a bad thing  It comes down to the system of using flags. If you were to focus solely on one flag, thatrsquos when the most toxic, negative elements come out. Whereas Irsquove seen places that start putting up their county flag and the Scotland flag and thatrsquos where you get the more pluralistic approach.ldquoA lot of the flags that are negative are political in origin, he adds, ldquowhereas what Irsquom trying to do is work with communities that donrsquot necessarily have any formal symbols to encourage the positive side. It would be easy to walk away, and say lsquotherersquos the ability to use these things for evil so no flagsrsquo. But thatrsquos not going to happen so without encouraging the positive, there will always be a negative.So what are his impressions about the status of the Union flag in Scotland  For many Scottish nationalists, itrsquos a negative symbol, but Tibbetts has a dferent take. ldquoIrsquove found the Union Jack to be on the whole a fairly positive symbol, he says. ldquoAnd I thinkanything has done anything positive for the Union Jack, itrsquos the  Olympics. He is aware, of course, he says, that there are political connotations to the Union Jackyou are looking through a particular prism, but he believes the flag has never been so positively used as it is now, even in Scotland. ldquoThe Union Jack is alive and well, he says, ldquobecause it isnrsquot just a flag anymore - itrsquos a pop culture icon. If the United Kingdom stopped existing for political reasons, orit just sank into the sea, the rest of the world would continue using the flag.Tibbetts has a similar positive impression of the saltire, and he feels it personally as a man who was brought up in England but has many connections to Scotland and now lives and works here.ldquoI still find the saltire very positive, he says. ldquoItrsquos the symbol of Scotland and now I have a Scottish we and a Scottish daughter, so I think of myself as very tied to Scotland. I will use it and I do use it and I encourage everyone to use it.In fact, Tibbetts, the go-to man on flags in Scotland, has a kind of mantra about the saltire that he thinks we should all stick to. He canrsquot control who uses the flag, he says. But he can control how he uses it. ldquoIt almost doesnrsquot matter how other people abuse it, he says. ldquoItrsquos my flag. This is our symbol.Career highThe registration of the Caithness flag has been a key success. This was the first mainland community flag in Scotland.Career lowIn my very first flag campaign after promoting my own design, a flag that failed several flag design basicswas chosen. However, this was a good early lesson as it taught me that it was more useful to promote good design principles and to provide communities with the tools to develop their own symbols.Favourite musicThe Moody Blues - I love the progressive, symphonic sound and their themes of philosophy and child-like wonder.Last book readSince the birth of my daughter last year Irsquove struggled to finish any book and even read any fiction at all.

But it is an aim we cannot achieve without adequate financial support.The draft budget will have a considerable impact on the important work Local Government does and in turn, on the daily lives of citizens and communities across Scotland.Council budgets have been subject to year on year cuts , while at the same time the demands on the services they provide have only increased.That is why we have now reached a point where there is simply nowhere left to go.Without a rethink from Scottish Government or a Parliamentary intervention, these budget proposals could put the final nail into many communities and services we deliver.The settlement for Scottish Local Government, as it currently stands, puts inclusive growth for our whole country at risk.This is not an idle threat. This settlement means that real jobs in real communities will go. It is as stark and simple as that.Cllr Alison Evison is President of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities"},{"url":null,"title":"new-research-reveals-scotlands-quietest-roads","story":"But as a perfect antidote, research has revealed the quietest roads in Scotland, meaning people can make the most of the stunning views across the country and bring the love back into driving.The study for GoCompare compiled a list of the  least-used picturesque roads in the country and those in Scotland feature stunning views from areas such as Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, Skye and Sutherland.The project, Scene But Not Heard, has mapped some of the quietest and most beautul roads in the UK, with some seeing fewer than  vehicles in a day.The A Laxford Bridge to Tongue, Sutherland, route tops the list, with an average of  vehicles per day travelling along the -mile road.The Highland road covers several beautul areas of natural landscape, with Smoo Cave and Loch Eriboll being part ofthe route.Also named is the A between Aberfoyle and Callander, known as the Dukersquos Pass, which leads through the Trossachs National Park.

Really, is this the best argument that she can come up with rather than asking the people directly to give their view of her plan There are in fact parallels across the Irish Sea for have a second referendum. The Irish people were asked to approve the Treaty of Lisbonin June  and rejected it by a margin of . per cent to . per cent. However, in October  a second referendum was held and the proposal this time was approved by a majority of . per cent to . per cent on an increased turnout.What Mrs May is really concerned about is that her plan which currently is not pleasing anyone will be rejected by the British people in favour of remaining within the EU. She cannot claim to be defending democracy by opposing a second EU referendum. Arguably the referendum in  was itself a ldquosecond referendum on EU membership as there was a referendum in  when the British people voted by a clear margin of . per cent to . per cent to remain within the EU. Presumably some of the people who voted ldquoyes in  changed their mind and voted ldquono in . Yet it seems that Mrs May is of the view that we are not to be trusted to give our considered opinion on the most important topic of the day. Is that really a defensible or indeed properly democratic position for our Prime Minister to take The British people are perfectly entitled to say that they wish to lend their support to Mrs Mayrsquos plan or indeed that have changed their mind. It is an important matter of political principle that they should at least be given the democratic opportunity to engage in a decision which affects all of our and our childrenrsquos future.John Smith, Argyle Terrace, Dunblane.WE were forewarned in todays editionthat the Prime Minister will urge MPs not to ldquobreak faith with voters and further ide the country by holding another poll on European Union membership.ldquoBreak faith with voters  How much faith has already been broken by Theresa Mayrsquos appeasement of the English nationalists and the fanatical free-marketeers who are united in their inability to deliver what they promised prior to the  referendum Mrs May has at no point during the past  months demonstrated that she recognised the concerns and indeed the fears of the  per cent of the UK electorate and  per cent in Scotland who voted to remain, not to mention of those who originally voted Leave but now recognise that they were hoodwinked.Mrs May herself has already done ldquoirreparable damage to British politics.I agree entirely with Marianne Taylorndash ldquoshe lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.John Milne, Ardgowan Drive, Uddingston.AT this critical moment in our history, It is our misfortune to have as the nationrsquos political leader such a thrawn woman as Theresa May. How can she possibly say that ldquoit would be undemocratic to give the people another chance to saythey still want the UK to leave the European Union, now that we know and understand all the implications and problems this would cause for generations to come Surely giving us a second chance, to confirm that is still what we want or  to say that we have now changed our mind, is the only sensible and democratic course of action  Instead she declares that ldquoa second vote would do irreparable damage to the UK. That is complete nonsense. On the contrary, it would simply and sensibly give the people the right to say ldquowe have changed our mind, which is entirely possible and even likely after the last two years of detailed discussion and debate.The whole Brexit fiasco has brought discredit to our political institutions, andit goes ahead it will cause serious international, economic and social damage to Great Britain for many years to come.

We will continue to co-operate with the countries on the other side of the North Sea but there will no longer be forced unity and constraint on our actions.Recently my attention has been drawn to the dferences in the British character and legal systems compared to those in southern and eastern Europe. The following example is of particular interest to us.We have had independence referendums but not the Catalonians. When frustration led the Catalonian Regional Government to take the matter into its own hands and initiate a referendum on independence, the Spanish Government ruthlessly attacked its citizens in that part of the country and the Catalan politicians, who had been responding to the wishes of their constituents, were jailed for rebellion. They remain in prison ndash some in solitary confinement ndash with no prospect of a trial.I dont think that could happen here but the extremes on both sides of the Brexit debate ndash No Deal or Remain ndash are so entrenched in their views, another referendum could cause civil unrest, whichever side came out on top.Naturally both extremes hate the compromise, but compromise is the only way of restoring a modicum of political peace.Iris Clyde,Voresheed, Kirkwall, Orkney.SEVERAL weekend newspapers warned people that it would be unwise to book holidays until finalisation of the Brexit discussions.

The first email came from Dad. An old teacher of mine from back in Northern Ireland, where I was brought up, had died. Dad wrote telling me what happened. The email surprised me ndash not because of the news about my teacher, but because it was my dad whorsquod written it. I thought our relationship was in the grave too. I replied briefly, and with no ill will, but I was curious why Irsquod even responded. Our relationship had been so bad and unpleasant over the years that I wondered why I risked rekindling it.A month later, I was working on a family tree for my mum, and for some reason I cannot fathom ndash curiosity, maybe, a subconscious need for resolution, perhaps ndash I sent my dad a few questions about our genealogy. My mum and dad had a stormy and unhappy marriage. Dad was often absent, and when he was home he seemed in a constant state of rage. He and I rarely spent more than a few minutes together when I was a boy, and after my parents split up when I was in my early twenties, our relationship withered to a few awkward drinks once a year and the odd telephone conversation.I resented him for all the things I felt Irsquod missed out on that other young men had experienced. It made me sad when I heard friends talking about how much they loved their dad and how hersquod taught them to swim, or ride a bike, or shave ndash wersquod done none of those things together. We dfer in almost every way, and wersquove no hinterlandndash no shared memories of good times.Dad, though, had his own demons ndash he had a painful childhood and he knows that damaged him when it came to being a father himself.Still, itrsquos strange how it was an email about a family tree, which laid down the roots for the new, tentative relationship dad and I are experiencing now.Dad replied to my email with a whole swathe of information that hersquod separately been gathering as research into the family tree. Hersquod uncovered a completely unknown branch of the Mackay family in America that I knew nothing about. Hersquod learned of them in the years of cold war when he and I didnrsquot utter a word to each other.I ended up in touch with those relatives in America and this summer a long-lost cousin called Alice ndash fittingly, a retired social worker ndash came to Scotland and we spent some time together. When I spoke to her about my father, I realised that I was no longer boiling with anger towards him, in fact, I suddenly became aware that the anger Irsquod held was as destructive for me as it was for him. As I talked to this charming stranger who shared some of the blood in my veins, it dawned on me for the first time that what I felt was real sadness about my father. Loss, even. Sadness for a connection that never was, loss of memories that neither of us had ever had ndash and regret that so much of what had gone on between my father and I was steeped in anger, and even hate, on both sides.What a god-awful pointless waste of two lives, I thought, as I found myself talking to my cousin about my dad. At this point, anger may have been put to one side and replaced with a melancholy for things that never were, but I still didnrsquot want to see my father again. We have an expression in our family ndash ldquoitrsquos all blood under the bridge, which might give you an idea of what kind of family we are ndash but I felt far too much blood had flowed under the bridge for us to ever be in the same room again.Then, however, I had a little intimation of my own mortality. I had a brush with ill-health this year that pulled me up sharp. I realised that one day I wonrsquot be here ndash and with that comes the knowledge that others wonrsquot be here one day either. It made me look on all my relationships with new eyes ndash to turn toward those I truly love and care for and value them all the more, and all those people were my family. There was a ghost at the feast though ndash and his name was Don, my dad.Serendipity seems to have reigned over so much of this new coming together of my dad and I ndash an email at just the right time, a family tree prodding the subconscious onward, a long-lost relative, a moment of sickness. So, when Dad wrote to me not long after Irsquod recovered, and askedwe could meet and try to put the past behind us, I was ready to agree. Neither of us would be here forever.And so, not long ago, my dad came to Scotland for three days and we spent more time in each otherrsquos company than wersquove ever done in our lives. My father and I had never even been to the cinema together, I realised. So we went to the movies and we had a laugh. We had a few decent meals and some good conversations.I think that for the first time in our lives we enjoyed each otherrsquos company ndash and thatrsquos a fine and good thing after four decades of simmering tension, dislike and anger. Wersquove a long way to go ndash we may not ever be bosom buddies, and thatrsquos fine as well.I wish English had a word for ldquohappy-sad, as thatrsquos how I feel about this little step my father and I have taken towards each other ndash and the time of year only adds to the mix of emotions, because this will be the first Christmas when Dad and I might truly feel like family at last that we belong to each other after all."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9189239.jpg?type=article-full","title":"plans-for-a-no-deal-brexit-being-stepped-up-after-criticism-for-theresa-mays-plan-admits-cabinet-minister","story":"\"We have been takingno deal seriously for quite some considerable period.

She has broken with all convention and, arguably, the Ministerial Code, by releasing to the media on Sunday that she would specically rule out a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote during her statement to Parliament the following day.This poses the question ndash has the Prime Minister just run the Brexit white flag up the flagpole and essentially made a Peoplersquos Vote more likely Four senior members of her Cabinet have said that a public vote may be the only way forward. Are they softening up the ground So what happens next The Prime Minister is in a dficult position of her own making. She has lost all authority and integrity. Remember back in  when she declared she would not call a snap General Election ndash she called one.Remember when she promised not to delay the ldquomeaningful vote last week ndash she delayed it.Remember when she said her deal was non-negotiable ndash and she subsequently went back to the EU to renegotiate it.So, when the Prime Minister categorically rules out a Peoplersquos Vote to break the parliamentary impasse we should all ask ourselves when it will be.We now know that the ldquomeaningful vote on the Prime Ministers Brexit ldquodeal will come back to Parliament in the week after the festive recess. That means a vote in the week beginning Monday th January.Over a month lost so the Prime Minister can try and bribe Parliament into supporting her botched deal in order to prevent a no deal.The Prime Minister and the overwhelming majority of MPs do not want a no deal scenario, so why doesnrsquot the PM rule this out in order to prevent the need for our public services and businesses from spending billions of pounds on no deal contingency planning.She has no plan B and is ploughing on trying to win a majority in Parliament for a deal that has as much chance of passing as Boris Johnson deciding to put the country before his naked ambition to be PM.I think the most likely outcome to come from the Parliamentary paralysis is a public vote. Whether you were a Leaver or a Remainer, we can all agree that the Government has singularly failed to deliver for any side.We also know that all the promises given by Farage and Co at the  referendum were  and that any deal that is done with the EU will never give us the same positive benefits to what we enjoy today as a full member.And a new public vote would be dferent from the  referendum. We now know what Brexit means for our country ndash it will make us poorer.Any effort by the Prime Minister to force her deal over the line without checking with the public will only reinforce the ision in our country, especially when we become much poorer as a result.It is, therefore, vital that the Prime Minster prepares a Plan B for when her worst of all worlds ldquodeal is voted down in January. That Plan B should be to make preparations for a public vote in order to sort out this Brexit mess.One thing is certain. The Prime Minster must reach out across the political ide, in the national interest, before it is too late.

months who already have a big brother or sister and had no support from the UK government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.\"With the Early Learning and School Age Payments this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide pound to pound more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.\"Thats a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this governments emphasis on the early years.\"Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent.

It was a simple message that voters could understand. Find a copy of the SNP manesto for the  general election and you’ll see it prominently on the front cover. “Independence in Europe - make it happen now!”Alex Salmond and his supporters pushed the party to embrace a more pro-European stance following his election as leader in .They believed membership of the evolving European Union offered Scotland the chance to move from being part of the UK to joining the EU club of nations.: Second referendum on EU membership “would damage politics”Under plans drawn up in Brussels in the s, EU nations were about to open their borders and fully commit their economies to the Single Market.While it was never the intention of the EU technocrats, this move towards integration meant that one of the oldest and most potent arguments against Scottish independence - that it would lead to border patrols at Berwick - was severely undermined. If an independent Scotland retained its EU membership alongside the rest of the UK, the SNP countered, there could be no hard border along the Cheviot Hills.“Scotland will have open borders with England,” the SNP manesto for the  general election claimed. “European countries have abolished internal frontiers and our close family and trading ties with England will not be interrupted in any way by Scottish independence.”This remained one of the party’s core messages on independence up to and including the  referendum.Along comes BrexitThat changed when a majority of voters across the UK - but not in Scotland - voted to leave the EU in . Suddenly, a key plank of SNP strategy dating back two decades had been removed.Presuming Brexit takes place as planned, Scotland will leave the EU alongside the rest of the UK. The old certainties of European membership will come to an end. Borders - as the on-going row over Northern Ireland proves - have become a live issue.If a majority of Scots were to vote in favour of independence at a future date, the new state created will start le outwith the EU. One of the immediate priorities for any Scottish government would then be to secure trade across its only land border.“An independent Scotland works wellboth Scotland and England are in the EU, but with England outside the EU, Scotland probably needs a bespoke deal with the EU rather than EU membership,” said Professor John Kay, a former economic advisor to the Scottish Government, in an interview with The Sunday Times.“The nature of that deal depends on the unknown trade deal between the UK England and the EU. As with all of the EU debate, it is actually about the complex detail that politicians and the general public would prefer not to engage with - which is the source of our current misery.”A hard border The Scottish Conservatives believe that the SNP failed to deal with the border question in , long before Brexit.“It was made perfectly clear during the  campaign that a hard border would be requiredScotland and England had dferent arrangements in relation to the EU,” a party spokesman told The Scotsman. “Given the UK is leaving the EU in March, and given it’s stated SNP policy for an independent Scotland to join the EU, it’s dficult to see how a hard border could be avoided.”The SNP believe Brexit - and the chaotic way it has been handled by the UK Government - strengthens the overall case for Scottish independence. They say independence would be the “opposite” of Brexit - putting emphasis on cooperation, not throwing up borders.“Brexit threatens to take Scotland out of a market eight times the size of the UK market alone, doing massive damage to jobs, investment and living standards,” a party spokesman said.“In , the people of Scotland were explicitly told that the only way to protect our place in Europe was to vote against independence. That has now been utterly exposed for the lie it always was.“Independence is the opposite of Brexit – it is about cooperating with friends and neighbours, not throwing up barriers, and that is the principle which will guide an independent Scotland.”: Brexit referendum ‘harms case against second independence vote’©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839780.1545148224!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford told go back to skye by tory mp","story":"The SNP leader at Westminster was reportedly told #go back to the Isle of Skye# as he stood to speak at an emergency Commons debate on Brexit.Ian Blackford was in the chamber for the EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate today when the comment was shouted, with several MPs quickly pointing the finger of blame at veteran Conservative member Sir Nicholas Soames.It provoked a furious reaction from senior Nationalists.

It was said to have been inspired by the waterfront in her native Boston, where she and husband Ted Hughes were living when she wrote the poem.The couple had moved to London by the time her pamphlet was published in  by Anderson’s one-man Tragara Press outfit, after Plath had been impressed by proofs he had sent her.Anderson ended up publishing Plath’s poem after initially writing to Hughes to express his admiration about his work.After being sent samples showing how the poem would appear in print, Plath wrote to Anderson, telling him: “I am writing on my own behalf to say how delighted my husband and I were with the proofs of A Winter Ship. I’m sending back the one we like best, with the border round it. “We thought we’d like the date, place and press in upright letters, as on the other proof, and my name deleted – as I’ll write that on the inside myself, with Christmas greetings too.”The National Library hopes the acquisition of the poem will raise greater awareness of Anderson, who was still operating his printing press at his home in the Highlands shortly before he died in  at the age of .Born in Fe in , he started his working le as a banker and took up a post with an antiquarian bookseller in Edinburgh after serving in the Royal Navy, before buying his own bookshop.Anderson would go on to publish an anthology of work by Barry Humphries, the Australian writer and actor best known for creating the character Dame Edna Everage.Graham Hogg, rare books curator at the National Library, said: “Alan Anderson had a private press so he just did what he wanted and when he wanted. He wasn’t actively going out and touting for work. He was never in it for the money – it was a hobby and a passion for him.“Alan Anderson mostly published small pamphlets for contemporary poets that he was interested in. He only really printed work that he liked or work for friends.“This particular one came about when he wrote to Ted Hughes to say how impressed he was by a short story he had written and askedhe had anything  and would be happy to print it. Ted Hughes wrote back to him and said that his we was writing poetry and askedhe could publish something. I doubt any money would have changed hands at all. They were never intended for public sale. “It’s very much a curio as she actually sent them out in their Christmas cards. He had sent her two proof copies and she chose the one she liked.”Born in Boston in , Plath met Hughes in  when she was studying at Cambridge University and they married a few months later. However, they had a tempestuous relationship and after Hughes met another woman in  he split with Plath, who had been troubled with mental illness for years.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening.

A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms.

Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jonathan Rea with his honorary degree from the University of Ulster at Belfasts Waterfront Hall“These others awards and occasions are new to me. It’s good that I have the support at home and actually moving back here is great timing.”Underneath his gown he was wearing a suit made by Isle of Man-based tailor The Noble Suitor. It was embroidered inside to read: ‘Made exclusively for Dr Jonathan Rea MBE’.The former Ballynure Primary School and Larne Grammar pupil said: “I’ve been back a few times to assemblies and to talk to the kids.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8741643.1545039707!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Age NI says a recently launched Department of Health review of emergency health care # with a particular focus on pensioners # is #a bit late in the day# for this winter and #should have started months ago#.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

Last nightfor example, two Honda civics used the area as a race track for over two hours.This isn’t a once off either. Far from it.”The request to increase the police patrols came from Jo-Anne Dobson, the local Ulster Unionist Assembly Candidate.Following contact from local residents, she raised the issue with PSNI District Commander Superintendent David Moore.Mrs Dobson said: “For some time now residents across the town and particularly those living along the Rathfriland Road have been plagued with nuisance drivers who are driving dangerously, noisily and presenting a danger to pedestrians, road users and to themselves.“Firstly, I encourage those engaging in this irresponsible, dangerous and le-threatening behaviour to think about the consequences, to think about others and to stop immediately.I also encourage anyone who witnesses this unsafe driving to report the vehicles registration number to the PSNI via the  non-emergency number. On most evenings cars can be heard racing across town and on a number of recent occasions I have been made aware that pedestrians have been harassed by those responsible.“Following contact from residents I raised the issue with the PSNI District Commander and welcome his assurance given to me that unmarked patrols will be increased in town in an effort to directly target those responsible. “This issue must be addressed in Banbridge before we have yet another road death similar to the tragic death of  year old Lesley-Ann McCarragher in Armagh last week, again allegedly caused by a road racing. “I once again call on anyone engaging in this irresponsible and reckless behaviour on our roads to stop and welcome the Police action to catch those responsible. If they do not stop, they must face the full consequences of their activates.”On social media, Banbridge resident Lynn Kerr labelled the racing a ‘disgrace’.She said: “Monday night was a disgrace! It went on for two full hours, until after am. And the noise of their exhausts were horrendous! They were at it again last night.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast mans first christmas with birth mum ruined by gangs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37637754.ece/1496d/AUTOCROP/w620/POLICE%20Fe%2012.jpg","title":"major incident lorries overturned on ferry from northern ireland docked at cairnryan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Areas covered are expected to include bank card payments in the EU and travelling to the continent with pets.Asked whether families should feel able to go ahead with plans to travel to Europe for the Easter holidays, which fall just after the expected date of Brexit, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I’m not aware of any reason they shouldn’t do that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs that , troops were ready for deployment in the case of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street stressed that it remains the Government’s “top priority” to deliver Brexit under the terms of the deal struck by Mrs May with Brussels, and the Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted that this remains “the most likely scenario”.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned that unless MPs back Mrs May’s deal when it s to the Commons in January the default option is for the UK to leave without any exit arrangement in place.“Parliament needs to back the deal because the consequence of not doing so is we risk the default of no-deal, and a responsible Government must prepare for that eventuality,” said Mr Barclay.“That is what we agreed at Cabinet. That is what we are going to do.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said no-deal planning was now an ‘operational priority’ He dismissed alternative plans being pushed by ministers – including a second referendum or a “managed” no-deal under which arrangements are made with Brussels to limit any negative impacts of severing ties with the EU.“There are a number of scenarios being floated in Government without, I think, people really engaging on the consequences of that – either the consequence to our democracy of not delivering on the referendum, not having Brexit – or the idea that we can cherry-pick and have some managed no-deal where the EU will suspend its own red lines, which I don’t think is feasible.”In a direct plea to the UK’s company bosses, he said that preparing for no-deal needed to be “much more of a priority for businesses up and down the country”.It is understood that ministers at the weekly session of Cabinet at  Downing Street were presented with three options – to continue with the current policy of enacting no-deal plans when it became necessary on a case-by-case basis to move to full implementation of the plans or to scale back no-deal preparations.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  At least  ministers spoke before it was agreed to move to full implementation, with no dissenting voices.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said that ramping up the preparations did not mean a no-deal outcome, telling colleagues: “Just because you put a seatbelt on doesn’t mean that you should crash the car.”Ms Rudd, who campaigned for Remain in the referendum, urged other ministers to consider job losses in their constituencies in the case of no-deal.Adding that Britain will have a positive future post-Brexitit gets a deal, she said “we have to put politics aside” and talk across the House to build a consensus, putting “country before politics”.The Press Association understands that Justice Secretary David Gauke was scathing about the prospect of a “managed no-deal” Brexit.He told fellow ministers it was “not a viable option” and was not on offer from the European Union, adding: “The responsibility of Cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them.”Brexit-backing Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom was one of the main critics of ministers – including Amber Rudd and Greg Clark – who have suggested there should be an “indicative vote” of MPs to choose from a range of options on the way forward.Speaking shortly after the meeting, Mrs May’s official spokesman said: “Cabinet agreed that with just over three months until we exit from the European Union we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Justice Secretary David Gauke was said to have been scathing over the prospect of a ‘managed no-deal Brexit’ “This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans.“Cabinet also agreed to recommend businesses now to also ensure they are similarly prepared, enacting their own no-deal plans as they judge necessary.“Citizens should also prepare in line with the technical notices issued in the summer and in line with further more detailed advice that will now be issued over coming weeks.”The spokesman added: “Delivering the deal remains the Government’s top priority and our best mitigation against a no-deal scenario.“This is a sensible Government ensuing that people are prepared for all scenarios.”Whitehall departments have identied some  workstreams on no-deal preparations, with each likely to involve a number of inidual plans."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove and ed balls filmed dancing gangnam style at christmas party","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We must be vigilant to ensure government and industry, that so badly failed us, do not water down these changes. Resident voices must be given weight and parliament must keep a watchfuleye on progress”Grenfell UnitedFacebookTwitterThe long-awaited response follows recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt in May, which the Government agreed to take forward in full.In her report, she found that indference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, recommending the creation of a new regulator.In September, the Government introduced a ban on using combustible cladding on new high-rise homes which is due to come into force on Friday –  months after the west London blaze.Part of the new implementation plan, Building a Safer Future, reads: “The Government accepts the need to create, in law, a tougher regulatory framework, under which regulators will have greater powers and more opportunities to intervene throughout the lecycle of a building.“We also consider that stronger sanctions and enforcement powers are needed to incentivise compliance and address noncompliance.”The campaign group Grenfell United called it a “long overdue shake up” of an industry which “for years has put profit over people”.While the Government’s commitments were “promising”, the group warned against “urgent” changes being kicked into the long grass.It said: “A signicant volume of Hackitt’s recommendations will now go to consultation.“We must be vigilant to ensure government and industry, that so badly failed us, do not water down these changes.“Resident voices must be given weight and parliament must keep a watchful eye on progress.” \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Housing Secretary James Brokenshire The anticipated new regulatory framework will apply to multi-occupancy buildings of at least  storeys, with a consultation in the spring  on whether additional buildings should be included.The Government will also consult on proposals to create dutyholders – people who will ensure residents’ safety is at the forefront of each stage of a building’s development – in a bid to strengthen accountability.Their responsibilities would be underpinned by regulations that would require “gateways” at key points where they would have to demonstrate they are “actively managing” safety risks.But the London Fire Brigade warned the safety reforms could fail because there were not enough building and fire safety people “with the relevant skills and qualications to provide the proper scrutiny”.The Government said it will establish a Joint Regulators Groupto help us develop new approaches, assist with the transition to a new regulatory framework and assess resource needs.   Grenfell United added: “The plan to work with existing industry regulators must only be a temporary step to identy, remediate and keep people safe in their homes.“Ultimately we need a fully independent regulatory body, with effective sanction and enforcement powers.”The LGA welcomed Mr Brokenshire’s commitment to implement the recommendations, and said it was pleased to be part of the JRG.Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: “The definition of higher risk residential buildings in the Hackitt Review is currently too narrow.“It must be extended to all buildings in which vulnerable people sleep other than private homes.“Consideration must also be given to lowering the height definition of high-rise buildings from the current definition.”"},{"url":null,"title":"troops held in readiness to deal with disruption from nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Civil servants will continue to work on preparations during the Christmas period.Labour Brexit spokeswoman Jenny Chapman said: “It is testament to the Prime Minister’s failure in these negotiations that the Government is now spending billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table.”Mr Williamson told the House of Commons that no formal request has yet come in from Government departments to make use of the , troops being “held at readiness”.Downing Street said that these numbers were in addition to the forces normally kept on stand-by by the Ministry of Defence in case of civil contingencies, such as during the  Olympics.Mrs May’s spokesman said the Government continued to believe that Brexit under the terms of the deal struck by Mrs May with Brussels remains “the most likely scenario”.But he added: “We will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans.“Cabinet also agreed to recommend to businesses and ensure they are similarly prepared, enacting their own no-deal plans as they judge necessary.“Citizens should also prepare in line with the technical notices issued in the summer and in line with further more detailed advice that will now be issued over coming weeks.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said no-deal planning was now an ‘operational priority’ Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned that unless MPs back Mrs May’s deal in January, the default option will be for the UK to leave without any exit arrangement in place.“Parliament needs to back the deal because the consequence of not doing so is we risk the default of no-deal, and a responsible Government must prepare for that eventuality,” said Mr Barclay.Repeating his party’s call for a “People’s Vote” second referendum on Brexit, Sir Vince said: “The decision to ramp up the no-deal pressure is psychological warfare. The Conservative Government are attempting to scare MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal.”Ministers at the weekly Cabinet session at  Downing Street choose full implementation of no-deal plans over two other options on the table – to continue with the current policy of enacting plans when it became necessary on a case-by-case basis or to scale back no-deal preparations.Just because you put a seatbelt on doesnt mean that you should crash the carAmber RuddFacebookTwitterWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said that ramping up the preparations did not mean a no-deal outcome, telling colleagues: “Just because you put a seatbelt on doesn’t mean that you should crash the car.”Arguing that Britain will have a positive post-Brexit futureit gets a deal, she urged other ministers to “put politics aside” and “put country before politics” by working to build a consensus across the Commons.Justice Secretary David Gauke was scathing about the prospect of a “managed no-deal” Brexit floated by some ministers, under which arrangements would be made with Brussels to limit the impact of severing ties without an agreement.“The responsibility of Cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them,” he told colleagues.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Justice Secretary David Gauke was said to have been scathing over the prospect of a ‘managed no-deal Brexit’ Brexit-backing Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom was critical of proposals from ministers such as Ms Rudd and Greg Clark for an “indicative vote” of MPs to choose from a range of options on the way forward.Mr Barclay dismissed proposals for a second referendum or a “managed no-deal”, saying: “There are a number of scenarios being floated in Government without, I think, people really engaging on the consequences.”In a direct plea to the UK’s company bosses, Mr Barclay said that preparing for no-deal needed to be “much more of a priority for businesses up and down the country”."},{"url":null,"title":"fortnite leads youtubes list of most watched gaming trailers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

We must then mutually trade with each other in WTO terms. We already trade very extensively with other countries in this way. “Presently % of the UK’s exports go to the EU, and another % go to countries in the world that the EU has trade arrangements with. So % of our trade goes to either EU or EU-controlled trade arrangements. That leaves % which is traded on WTO terms around the world. “The UK’s biggest trading partner is the United States, and we don’t have a trade deal with them. We trade with them by and large on WTO terms. A hefty bit of our trade works in this way, so why not all of it  It can be done.”Mr Allister also warned that the backstop arrangement would be a stepping stone to a united Ireland and must be rejected to protect the Union.Storm warning: disruptions across NI this morningWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of flooding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Further, he also dismissed claims by Remainers that a hard border on the island of Ireland would be the inevitable outcome of a no-deal Brexit, declaring that the idea of a backstop being a necessary part of any withdrawal agreement is “built on a hoax”.He added: “The only people with any legal obligation to institute a hard border is the EU. Under the EU treaties, it says the frontier state, in this case the Irish Republic, must provide and maintain the EU’s border.“ Leo Varadkar has said the Republic won’t be providing it, the EU and the UK have said they don’t require it, so the obvious question is who is going to implement it  “If the answer is no one, then why are we talking about the need for a backstop in the first place ”However, SDLP MLA Claire Hanna maintained that some kind of customs infrastructure along the Irish border would be requiredthe UK ended up trading with the EU under WTO terms. Without it, she claimed, the UK would be open to legal challenges from other nations.She told the News Letter: “If the UK were trading with the EU on WTO terms, as no deal advocates want but Brussels representatives have expressed serious concerns about, then keeping an open border would likely violate WTO’s non-discrimination principle.“This leaves the UK wide open to litigation from any other country who are subject to tarfs, and ultimately the EU will seek to take steps to protect the single market.”Responding to this claim, Mr Allister said: “The WTO is not an enforcement organisation in the sense that they go round looking to see who is infringing. They only act as a reactive body in that regard when someone has made a complaint.“So is Claire Hanna suggesting that the government of the Irish Republic would complain that the UK does not have adequate border checks  I don’t think so, so let’s be real here.”try catch  TrendingREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesAll queers out daubed on N.I. flat front-doorWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of floodingEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceTributes paid to tragic NI teacher who died in climbing accident          ..

The health body’s Northern Ireland director Mark Taylor, speaking after the publication of the latest hospital waiting times, said: “We can’t go on like this – with health here operating on single year budgets and barely enough money to keep its head above water.”The latest set of hospital waiting times, published at the end of last month, showed that nearly , people in Northern Ireland had been waiting more than an entire year for inpatient treatment.In England, with a population of around  million, the equivalent figure is just ,.The audit office report warns that,the health and social care system continues on the current model, there simply won’t be enough cash to pay for it.“As the health and social care system faces mounting pressures and rising demand for care, the costs of maintaining existing service models are increasing at a pace which cannot be sustained within available budgets,” Mr Donnelly said.Muckamore Abbey scandal: health chief apologises to families Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"SDLP health spokesperson Mark H Durkan said: “The system is not merely at breaking point, it is broken, and unable to meet the needs of the people. The findings of this report are reflective of the systemic failures of previous Executives and years of disastrous workforce planning.”He added: “Common sense solutions were not given due consideration by previous governments. Their failure to implement anything of the sort is nothing short of neglect. As a result, a health system that was previously teetering on the brink is now falling off a clf edge.”UUP health spokesperson Roy Beggs said: “The health system cannot continue without change. Civil servants are reticent about making political decisions. Signicant, long-term decisions are needed and in the absence of a health minister – a position vacated by Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill of course – in order to make these changes a direct rule minister needs to be in place.” A DUP spokesperson said: “Transformation of our health service is needed. The DUP appointed Prof Bengoa and the expert , and are determined to see their report fully implemented.”Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew said: “In order to deliver a health and social care system that will achieve better outcomes for people a strategic approach to transformation, as set out by former minister for health Michelle O’Neill. in the Delivering Together plan, is needed.”try catch  TrendingREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesAll queers out daubed on N.I. flat front-doorWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of floodingEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceTributes paid to tragic NI teacher who died in climbing accident          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

regulations industry post grenfell","story":"Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said establishing a ldquoradically-new system would be the best tribute for the  victims of the fire on June  last year.Mr Brokenshire said the Government had committed to a programme of reform focused on four key areas: introducing more effective regulations and accountability clearer guidance prioritising residents and working with the industry to drive change.The long-awaited response follows recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt in May, which the Government agreed to take forward in full.In her report, she found that indference and ignorance led to a ldquorace to the bottom in building safety practices, recommending the creation of a new regulator.In September, the Government introduced a ban on using combustible cladding on new high-rise homes which is due to come into force on Friday ndash  months after the west London blaze.Part of the new implementation plan, Building a Safer Future, reads: ldquoThe Government accepts the need to create, in law, a tougher regulatory framework, under which regulators will have greater powers and more opportunities to intervene throughout the lecycle of a building.ldquoWe also consider that stronger sanctions and enforcement powers are needed to incentivise compliance and address noncompliance.The campaign group Grenfell United called it a ldquolong overdue shake up of an industry which ldquofor years has put profit over people.While the Governmentrsquos commitments were ldquopromising, the group warned against ldquourgent changes being kicked into the long grass.It said: ldquoA signicant volume of Hackittrsquos recommendations will now go to consultation.ldquoWe must be vigilant to ensure government and industry, that so badly failed us, do not water down these changes.ldquoResident voices must be given weight and parliament must keep a watchful eye on progress.\"Housing Secretary James Brokenshire The anticipated new regulatory framework will apply to multi-occupancy buildings of at least  storeys, with a consultation in the spring  on whether additional buildings should be included.The Government will also consult on proposals to create dutyholders ndash people who will ensure residentsrsquo safety is at the forefront of each stage of a buildingrsquos development ndash in a bid to strengthen accountability.Their responsibilities would be underpinned by regulations that would require ldquogateways at key points where they would have to demonstrate they are ldquoactively managing safety risks.But the London Fire Brigade warned the safety reforms could fail becausethere were not enough building and fire safety people ldquowith the relevant skills and qualications to provide the proper scrutiny.The Government said it will establish a Joint Regulators Groupto help us develop new approaches, assist with the transition to a new regulatory framework and assess resource needs.Grenfell United added: ldquoThe plan to work with existing industry regulators must only be a temporary step to identy, remediate and keep people safe in their homes.ldquoUltimately we need a fully independent regulatory body, with effective sanction and enforcement powers.The LGA welcomed Mr Brokenshirersquos commitment to implement the recommendations, and said it was pleased to be part of the JRG.Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ldquoThe definition of higher risk residential buildings in the Hackitt Review is currently too narrow.ldquoIt must be extended to all buildings in which vulnerable people sleep other than private homes.ldquoConsideration must also be given to lowering the height definition of high-rise buildings from the current

Craigavon Leisure Centre progressing wellThe latest build milestone paves the way for a series of key installations in quick succession, including the creation of two additional pools, an eight-court sports hall, studio spaces, squash courts and an indoor children’s soft play area.Tandragee-based concrete and piling firm Taranto installed the , concrete piles needed to support the -tonne steel frame on the dryside of the building, supplied and installed by Walter Watson, a family firm based in Co Down.Once complete, the new leisure centre will also be home to a world class ,m gym - the largest available anywhere in Ireland – as well as an extensive outdoor water-sports provision, traditional best-in-class fitness facilities and fluid open spaces including a café and studios, which have been designed to meet community and visitor needs.Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr. Julie Flaherty, said: “A flagship project creating at least  jobs on site, with more to follow, this is a pivotal moment in the development of this new and exciting leisure facility, which has been designed to transform the health, wellbeing and quality of le for residents and visitors for generations to come.”The new centre will be among the first in Northern Ireland to feature ‘Pool Pod’  lts, designed as a legacy of the  London Olympics and Paralympics to improve pool access for people with disabilities and the less mobile.This follows a major partnership with Disability Sport NI to deliver a flagship leisure centre which supports the development and long-term sustainability of sports and leisure programmes for people with disabilities.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
