[{"url":null,"title":"Canadian man discovers lost interview Kurt Cobain 27 years later","story":"    Lost and found: A nearly never-been-heard 1991 interview with Nirvana legend Kurt Cobain has been uncovered after the cassette tape was boxed up for 27 years          Canadian physics teacher Roberto LoRusso (pictured left as a college student) was only 21 years old when he landed an interview with the then-hardly known Nirvana frontman before their concert in Toronto in 1991 \u0027It was before Nevermind was released, so they were a big deal to us in our little niche music scene, but in the greater market nobody knew much of them at that point,\u0027 said the Canadian physics teacher. \u0027My intention at the time was to simply get a phone interview.\u0027I harassed the record label reps on a weekly basis. I think I called four or five times. Finally on the last call, the rep said I\u0027ve been awarded one of the few independent media interviews.\u0027I thought it was just going to be a phone interview, so I asked what time Kurt would be calling the show. She said actually I\u0027d be going to Toronto to interview them in person. Of course I was like, wow, that\u0027s even better, that\u0027s great.\u0027\u0027I was so naive at the time, I asked her, So, I guess I should probably buy tickets then for the show. There was a pregnant pause, and she responded you\u0027ve clearly not done many interviews of this type before have you? We provide you free tickets. I was like, Sweet!\u0027          LoRusso, pictured far right in 1992, dabbled as a DJ on his university\u0027s student radio in the small town of London, Ontario          After playing a few snippets of the interview on his student station - to an audience of around 15 people - LoRusso (pictured in white) boxed up the cassette tape and left it gathering dust for the next 27 yearsWhen LoRusso asked him about his previous comments disparaging white rap artists, Cobain shot back: \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know. Hmm, was I drunk at that time?\u0027I\u0027m a fan of rap music but most of it\u0027s so misogynist that I can\u0027t even deal with it. I\u0027m really not that much of a fan. I totally respect and love it because it\u0027s one of the only original forms of music that\u0027s been introduced. The white man doing rap is like watching a white man dance. We can\u0027t dance, we can\u0027t rap.\u0027When asked what the future held for him, the grunge icon gave a characteristically nihilistic response.\u0027Whatever, I don\u0027t know. Televisions out the window. Red snapper. Fire extinguishers. Sparklers, fireworks.\u0027LoRusso said this attitude was evident, despite the band being on the cusp of stardom.\u0027As I was talking with him, there was a little bit of laissez-faire, almost indifference to what was going on around him. I didn\u0027t quite understand it, I didn\u0027t get it,\u0027 said the teacher. \u0027Because you\u0027re signed to Geffen, you\u0027re on top of the indie world, you\u0027re creating the most relevant stuff to date. And he almost couldn\u0027t care less, or was so distracted by something else that he didn\u0027t really seem to be enjoying himself.\u0027At the time I dismissed that thought. I\u0027d just met the guy. But it was something that stuck with me. When he took his own life, it really made sense.\u0027It made me realize success doesn\u0027t mean anything if your world is chaos in your own mind. It\u0027s heartbreaking, he was a fantastic artist.\u0027Three years after the interview, on April 8, 1994, LoRusso was taking a seven-hour drive home from teachers college in Montreal when he heard on the radio that Cobain had been found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He spent the rest of the drive listening to the world come to terms with the news.          He met Cobain before Nirvana\u0027s show in Toronto and explains he was \u0027woefully ill-prepared\u0027 but said the rock star was \u0027remarkably gracious and patient\u0027          Three years after the interview, on April 8, 1994, Cobain would take his own life, leaving behind wife Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain (pictured left) \u0027I just remember the highway, and the Buick Regal that I was driving, and hearing the radio memorials on the scratchy indie radio station. I knew it was one of those moments I\u0027m going to remember forever.\u0027LoRusso says his encounter with Cobain put him on a trajectory towards his own love of music.He had a band in the 90s called Sanseiru and these days he plays drums for a band called Red Arms.Joe Perry, 68, of Aerosmith is released from the hospital...Rihanna, 50 Cent, Missy Elliot, and more pay tribute to...Share this articleHe also has his own solo dubnoisepunk project called Dead City Beat.LoRusso said he too has suffered from depression like Cobain, but the sense of purpose that teaching gives him has helped him maintain his mental health.\u0027The most important thing that someone can have is a sense of purpose. Without it, life becomes very difficult to live,\u0027 he said.\u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what resources you have, how popular you are or how great a musician you are, if you feel your life is meaningless it\u0027s a pretty dark place to be. I\u0027m pretty fortunate that I fell into the right career, I\u0027m a pretty lucky guy when it comes to that.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Mickey Mouse turns 90 Iconic character celebrated huge new NY exhibition","story":"    A new large exhibition in New York City celebrates Mickey Mouse\u0027s 90th anniversary. The exhibition is a homecoming of sorts for Mickey, whose third film, ‘Steamboat Willie,’ premiered at what was then the Colony Theatre on Broadway on November 18, 1928 - it is from this date that 90 years is being marked.

In Katherine Bernhardt’s mural, called ‘99Cent Hot Dog,’ the frankfurter with mustard plays a predominant role          Katherine Bernhardt’s mural, called ‘99Cent Hot Dog, (pictured), is one of the many new pieces of art commissioned for a large exhibition commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mickey Mouse. The exhibition is \u0027a unique dialogue between really incredible archival moments… and then tremendous contemporary art moments from artists who are true originals in their own right,’ Darren Romanelli, the curator, said          A room in the exhibition, called Sorcerer’s Way, features the classic 1940 film \u0027Fantasia,\u0027 and a still from the film is pictured above.

One of the first cartoons to use synchronized sound and music, the film would make Mickey a star. One of the first rooms of the exhibition pays homage to that film, which also featured Mickey’s sweetheart Minnie Mouse. A big steamboat takes center stage and comes equipped with a functioning ship’s wheel that can be whirled. Nearby is Steamboat Redux, which has two screens. One, on the left shows the original film, and, the other, on the right, shows artists reimagining its scenes.‘Took the original Steamboat Willie short, we chopped it up in about 35 scenes and we asked each animator or artist to be as graphically interpretative as they could,’ explained John T. Quinn, who produced and directed the Redux. ‘We used the original soundtrack, the original layout so that the film continuity holds together.’Quinn told DailyMail.com that it took about two and a half years to do the film, and many animators wanted the famous scene where Mickey is whistling. Included in the Redux film, he said, are many different types of animation: stop motion, hand-drawn on paper and computer, and CG or computer-generated.Ever since he was a kid, Quinn said he wanted to work for Disney as an artist, and now that he does, ‘it’s really a dream come true.

I use it a reference a lot in my work because it kind of embodies LA in many ways,’ she said, who lives in Los Angeles, and adding that she was so obsessed with Disney she considered working there as a princess - Snow White - for one of her first jobs.Superimposed on the bedroom scene is a shadow of the forest, she said, which adds a ‘little bit of darkness and mystery, which is a lot of what Disney is to me – it’s the light and dark and mystery.’ Near Papademetropoulous’ piece is Katherine Bernhardt’s mural called ‘99Cent Hot Dog.’‘It features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and hot dogs with mustard,’ Bernhardt said. ‘I did that because I like humor in art and I think hot dogs are funny.’Bernhardt usually does paintings but was excited to do a mural, which was painted directly on the wall using house paint.          Katherine Bernhardt (pictured) stands in front of her mural called ‘99Cent Hot Dog.’ Using house paint, Bernhardt painted directly on the wall, and said the mural features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and hot dogs with mustard. ‘I did that because I like humor in art and I think hot dogs are funny,’ Bernhardt told DailyMail.com           Shinique Smith (pictured) stands in front of her piece called ‘Bale Variant No. 0026, (Ode to Mickey Mouse, My First Love).’ Smith said Mickey  was important to her growing up and told DailyMail.com she is a \u0027Disney girl.\u0027 Smith said her piece is comprised of Mickey Mouse plush toys throughout the ages.

In front of the photo, encased in glass is an honorary Oscar Disney was awarded in 1932 for the creation of Mickey Mouse.Next up are rooms in black and white that feature Mickey’s first film, ‘Plane Crazy,’ and the artwork of Daniel Arsham called ‘Hiding Mickey’ – the large white Mickey that seems to be bulging out of the wall.Arsham ‘celebrates Mickey’s timeless form in his signature renowned style of stretching figures along the wall,’ Romanelli told DailyMail.com in an interview. ‘It’s giant, it’s so big and it’s coming out of the wall. So architecturally, he’s playing with space – something so iconic as a mouse behind the wall.’Singer and songwriter James Fauntleroy created a song to accompany Arsham’s installation, Romanelli said, and visitors have the option of putting on the headphones and ‘getting a bit lost in the audio file as well as the visual experience or just taking it in visually.’          Ariana Papademetropoulous (pictured) stands next to her painting called ‘My Mother’s Bedroom in 1979\u0027 that features a ceramic figurine of Mickey Mouse on her mom’s bedside table. Growing up, Papademetropoulous said she was ‘very much into Mickey Mouse’ and drew him oftenThere is fun to be had in the ‘Fantasia’ room, which is called Sorcerer’s Way: look into the two wells and there are the original pencil sketches for the 1940 film, which is set to classical music and is about Mickey playing while the sorcerer is away. The sketches are out of the archives for the first time and were animated. A giant replica of the sorcerer hat that Mickey puts on during the film and where people can stand under is one of the many photo opportunities throughout the exhibition.After indulging in brooms and wizard’s caps, the next room has a different type of nostalgia to luxuriate in: the Mickey Mouse Club. The show has gone through many iterations, and, depending on your age, a visitor may yearn for Annette Funicello, part of the original show from the 1950s, or the many stars - Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Keri Russell and Ryan Gosling – from the All-New Mickey Mouse Club that started airing in 1989 until 1994.Romanelli, the curator, said: ‘Those were such important years, you know, being a teenager and not wanting to grow out of being a kid but also wanting to.’He laughed and added: ‘It was definitely an important chapter for me. We have a Mickey Mouse Club room where we recreated the 90s set to a tee so for anybody in my age demo that walks in that room, it should resonate.’Monitors placed around the set show a young Spears and Timberlake singing and dancing their out heart.Also in that room is an intriguing artwork by Brian Bress. Romanelli explained that Bress drew Mickey Mouse 2,000 times, then built a suit for himself covered in those drawings. The video, titled ‘Exactly (Mickey Mouse),’ shows a white piece of paper drawn with black and white Mickey figures. Bress, who is dressed in a suit that matches that foreground, cuts pieces out of it, revealing him in the background. It is artwork that is ever shifting and constantly changing.           Pictured above is Keith Haring\u0027s 1981 \u0027Untitled (Mickey Mouse).\u0027 Haring, who died in 1990, is known for his pop art that included chalk outlines drawn on New York City subways.

Otherwise they are sued,’ Block continues. ‘There are private security firms that pressure workers not to talk to strangers. They control their social media accounts and there are all kinds of reprisals. It took us quite a while to get in touch with the workers. We collected all the information to get a bigger picture about what is going on there.‘But when we eventually did it (in collaboration with local students) we were surprised how proud many of them were to do this job. They told us: Without us social media would be a complete mess. On the other hand many of them silently suffer from the impact the work has on their mental health. After a very long period of research, in which we built up a relationship of trust with the workers, we worked together with our protagonists of the film to find out how to make a film about this work.’The process of securing the participation of such workers – men and women with firsthand knowledge of how the system works – was one that had to be carefully orchestrated. Riesewieck tells DailyMail.com how colleagues were secretly ‘photographed while talking to possible subjects and then the photo was sent to all the employees in order to threaten them in case they were willing to talk to us.‘The offices are protected by airport scanners at the doors and surveilled by private security firms who sometimes even control the private social media behavior of the workers - just to make sure they are not in touch with journalists. So we really needed to find creative ways how to make a film about this completely hidden work.‘We eventually did by finding an abandoned office of this very type of work in a business district of Manila with all the typical work stations still inside where we could invite our subjects in order to learn more about their work. This protected space made it possible for them to share experiences about their traumatizing work and their feelings, in which way they are affected and so on.’          \u0027Cleaners\u0027 are not employed directly by tech giants such as Facebook or Twitter - which have been the subject of congressional hearings in the US exploring their practices - but rather by other companies - and the well-known social media platforms are often given code namesThe content moderators are affected in vastly different ways some are proud and see their role as guardians, while others are deeply affected, such as the formerly innocent devout Catholic who finds it hard to get images of male genitalia out of her head. The film also includes the story of one moderator specializing in images of self-harm he repeatedly asked to be transferred but was denied, and he ended up taking his own life.The pitfalls of the job are, clearly, manifold.But The Cleaners also explores the wider societal implications of their work. Sanitizing content means that images of war and violence – such as bombings in Syria – are often designated as terrorist-related, deleted and kept from online audiences, preventing them from being fully informed.Abdulwahab Tahhan, who works with the NGO Airwars, laments in the film how summarily deleting such content hinders the efforts of his organization – and prevents global citizens from receiving vital information.‘Without our work, the armies or the governments would have a straight pass without anybody challenging them,’ he says in The Cleaners. ‘There would be, I think, more civilians getting killed there would be less closure we would not be able to know what’s going on. These videos are needed. These videos are part of the war. They provide information they provide evidence for the future.‘But the problem is, these videos are quite often classified as ISIS videos. It’s been seen that this is very graphic, so they get deleted. Now the censorship that’s taking place on YouTube, it’s affecting a lot of organizations.’The cultural, educational and political backgrounds of the content moderators inherently affects what’s deleted and what’s allowed to remain without context, it’s wildly difficult for such workers to make informed decisions about images and footage.    Some content moderators are proud and believe their work helps keep the Internet from being a \u0027complete mess\u0027 others have suffered mentally and emotionally from being forced to view images that include beheadings, assaults and other atrocities - with the film even telling the story of one moderator who took his own life          Filmmaker Block tells DailyMail.com: ‘Most of the billions of people in the world who use social media don’t have any clue who does the clean-up-work for them. Most of us take it for granted we don’t have to see videos of beheadings, rape or torture in our newsfeeds. We don’t know there are thousands of young workers in the developing world who sacrifice themselves in order to keep us “safe” and provide us with a “healthy environment” when we go online\u0027          Directors Moritz Riesewieck, left, and Hans Block went to great lengths not only to obtain interviews but also to protect \u0027cleaners\u0027 - even offering them access to a psychologistWithout comment or judgement, a few examples are woven into the film. The devout Catholic content moderator deletes any images of nudity, period. A moderator deleted the award-winning Vietnam War photo depicting a naked young girl running from a napalm attack – because it showed an unclothed minor. Another moderator deleted an image he believed to be a young child killed in a flood accident – when, in reality, it was an image of a toddler victim of the Syrian conflict, likely a drowned refugee.Artist Kahled Barakeh had posted that photo and others on facebook to highlight the atrocities in his native country – only for the post to be deleted after three days.‘There was no explanation,’ he says in the film. ‘I tried to, in every possible way, to be in touch, but it was impossible … Sometimes I try to think about it: Who decides what is the policy of Facebook? I would love to meet these people, know who they are – because by logic, their background, who they are, it affects how they think. That child didn’t die out of a normal situation.’Such harsh realities should be shared on social media, he says, because ‘we should keep disturbing the world’.The documentary hammers home the point that major companies, and not just the content moderators, should be facing major ethical and procedural questions.‘A decision about what constitutes terror content is a really context-based decision,’ says Nicole Wong, a former policy maker at Google and Twitter – and former deputy US chief technology officer under President Obama – who was interviewed by the filmmakers.‘It may show up on one platform as a true threat, and it may show up on another platform as news or as satire or criticism commenting on a piece of content … it’s hard to know whether something should be removed or not.’Rhymes with \u0027Zuck\u0027: Jim Carrey slams Mark Zuckerberg after...Mother whose \u0027beautiful and smiley\u0027 teenage son was driven...Google wants to put a virtual assistant in every room of the...Share this articleThe Cleaners interviews former executives from major companies such as Facebook and Google – but it proved veritably impossible to get current employees to talk, the filmmakers tell DailyMail.com.‘From the beginning, we wanted to involve Silicon Valley executives in our film to discuss the issue of global networks and how to handle the moderation process of the platforms,’ Block tells DailyMail.com. ‘It would be so easy to blame or insult the social media for all their mistakes. But we never did. Much more, we wanted to encourage an open dialogue to think about the problem of the global network.‘But getting in contact with the executives of the big social media companies wasn\u0027t any easier as there is this code of silence in Silicon Valley. None of the employees of Facebook or Google talks about what\u0027s happening inside. We contacted several dozens of people and never got an answer. We\u0027ve even sent the final cut of our film to all the major companies and asked for a public statement. There was no response either.‘When we tried to promote the film in Germany and France via social media, we got the message after a short time that the trailer violated the community guidelines and was deleted. Sad but true! Intransparency is one of the main characteristics of the companies. That was very annoying and upsetting.‘Eventually we got in touch with some of the former representatives of Facebook and Google YouTubeTwitter. Many of the former representatives regret that they helped to build technology with so many terrible effects.’The power struggle with inidual governments, as well, is investigated by the film, which touches upon censorship in countries such as Turkey and issues with information spread in places like Myanmar – where most people get all of their news from platforms such as Facebook and are arguably less able to distinguish between fact and fiction. That reality contributes to major problems such as genocide and marginalization, with The Cleaners pointing out that Facebook has been used to promote hatred of the ethnic minority Rohingya people in Myanmar.  The film interviews former Google and Twitter executive Nicole Wong, left, who went on to be US  deputy chief technology officer under President Barack Obama - as well as activist Abdulwahab Tahhan, with NGO Airwars, who believes blocked content of bombings and other violence in Syria is hampering efforts by organizations such as his that are trying to show the world what is really going on. Tahhan says: \u0027We should keep disturbing the world\u0027          Artist Khaled Bakareh is also interviewed in the film he posted photos on Facebook of children killed during the Syria conflict, only to see them removed days later. He says: \u0027Sometimes I try to think about it: Who decides what is the policy of Facebook? I would love to meet these people, know who they are – because by logic, their background, who they are, it affects how they think\u0027But the documentary makers themselves also had to struggle with what they should and shouldn’t show in the film.Riesewieck explains how they ‘decided only to show a tiny part of the disturbing content itself and whenever possible rather to show the reactions of the content moderators on the content. It is clearly not our aim to shock the audience.‘But in cases like with the war in Syria we still need to ask ourselves what gives us the right not to be disturbed by the human victims of this terrible war which so many countries worldwide are included in. We want to make awareness that the so called “healthy environment” on social media comes at a huge price: A very perfidious mental abuse of young low wage workers in the developing world and the loss of a lot of ambivalent, challenging, eye-opening material.’The filmmakers made a psychologist available to the content moderators they interviewed, and they hope that their final product prompts thought and discussion among social media users, platforms and governments alike. Their film focuses on an aspect of the Internet that is rarely discussed or investigated – or thought about by the billions using social media every day for information and communication.‘What was really surprising was, how many grey areas remain despite the guidelines the content moderators have to follow,’ Riesewieck tells DailyMail.com. ‘Content moderators told us they don\u0027t dare to forward every second case in which they feel unsure about which guideline to apply or how to recognize the context of a picture or video and therefore just use their gut feelings.‘According to several different content moderators in Manila there is a golden rule everybody has to learn in their three to five-day-training for the job: “Don\u0027t overthink!” Just think about the consequences for activists, civil rights organizations, minorities and others if their content is deleted from Facebook, Youtube, Twitter just because a young low wage worker didn\u0027t know about the context and purpose of the post and intuitively got it wrong.’His co-director says: ‘Most of the billions of people in the world who use social media don’t have any clue who does the clean-up-work for them. Most of us take it for granted we don’t have to see videos of beheadings, rape or torture in our newsfeeds. We don’t know there are thousands of young workers in the developing world who sacrifice themselves in order to keep us safe and provide us with a healthy environment when we go online. \u0027At the same time, hundreds of thousands of newsworthy pictures and videos disappear every single day without our notice. A lot of iniduals as well as whole groups of our societies are secretly silenced with huge effects on our democracy.‘We all should question the power social media has on all of us and become much more aware of the impact it has on today\u0027s societies and all our minds. Instead of just passively consuming the net and allowing a few companies to dictate the rules for our digital public we should claim a much more participative, erse net - in the hands of the public.’‘We should become aware about how social media has hacked our desire to be loved by making us seek likes with every post we make. And by constantly asking us what we think about this and that people have familiarized with the idea of constantly having opinions. All these triggers and nudges make us produce more and more content in order to keep the level of positive feedback. The first step to limit the addiction to these technologies and dealing with them in a more mindful and meaningful way is becoming aware about those effects on our minds and on behavior.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Amanda Knox reveals ENGAGED","story":"    Amanda Knox accepted her boyfriend Christopher Robinson\u0027s proposal .

What good would leaving now actually achieve?\u0027He has concerns about the deal but he also has concerns about no deal. Ultimately he decided it would be wrong to walk away. It was a tough call to make but he hopes the deal can be changed to make it more sellable.\u0027It is said that Ms Leadsom was \u0027having a lot of phone conversations\u0027 with the other four ministers.Another source said: \u0027The focus is going to be on getting the deal into a better place.

He was last spotted exercising at the Meadows Rehab Centre in Wickenburg, Arizona, last yearBut the real drama lies elsewhere. For despite being one of Hollywood’s most recognisable stars, Spacey has apparently disappeared off-screen as well as on it.Nothing has been seen or heard of the double Oscar-winning actor since the first allegations emerged over a year ago in October 2017.On both sides of the Atlantic, where Spacey owns multi-million-pound homes, the question is being asked with growing urgency: where is Kevin Spacey? ‘He’s become a total recluse,’ one friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘No one has heard from him. He’s vanished. It’s almost unbelievable that someone of his stature can pull it off in a world where everyone has a cell phone.’One producer described Spacey as having ‘one of the most recognisable faces on the planet’ and added: ‘I was with him when he walked into a restaurant in Beverly Hills and the whole place applauded.’It may be a long time before he garners applause again.His downfall began on October 29, 2017, when Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him in the star’s New York apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14, triggering a string of similar complaints.          As the new series of the US political drama House Of Cards was screened earlier this month there was a gaping hole. President Frank Underwood, portrayed  by actor Kevin Spacey was killed off by uneasy producers and script writers following sexual assault and harassment allegations made against the actor  last yearTo date, 30 men have made public allegations about the actor. While no formal charges have been filed, police in LA and London are investigating allegations of sexual assault, including rape. In the UK, there are six active investigations. The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years until 2015, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his tenure.Spacey issued a swift and contrite apology, ended years of rumours about his sexuality by ‘coming out’ as gay and checked into sex rehab clinic The Meadows in Arizona alongside disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.But unlike Weinstein – who has been photographed going about his daily business, visiting his lawyers’ offices and picking his children up from school – there has been no sign of Spacey anywhere.The Mail on Sunday has spoken to – or attempted to speak to – dozens of Spacey’s friends, colleagues and acquaintances in the UK and the US in an attempt to piece together his movements.Final season of House of Cards gets middling reviews as...\u0027It brought the #MeToo movement very close to home\u0027: Tom...Share this articleBut it is clear that Spacey’s vanishing act may be his best coup de théâtre so far.The last known pictures of the actor are fuzzy paparazzi shots taken at the £25,000-a-month rehab facility in November last year.There, Spacey was supposed to undergo a 45-day sex addiction ‘detox’ but, we can reveal, checked out after only 21 days.‘He left early,’ said one friend, on condition of anonymity. ‘He only stuck it out for three weeks.’Where he went after that remains unclear – although there are plenty of associates who claim to know where he is.One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days insists that he is living in seclusion in the Cook Islands, a string of 15 tiny islands in the middle of the South Pacific.‘He’s living as a hermit in the Cook Islands,’ she said authoritatively. ‘He’s keeping his head down until this blows over.     One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days said he is living in seclusion in the Cook IslandsHe still has a lot of rich friends from his Old Vic days. He has enough money to stay hidden.’But a source who worked on House Of Cards insists that the actor, whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, is in hiding in France.‘He’s been in the South of France living on a big estate,’ the man said. ‘He’s been working out like crazy, doing massive oil paintings and keeping a low profile.’It may well be, sources say, that he has put his formidable acting prowess to good use in order to avoid detection.One source said: ‘Kevin is travelling under his real name of Kevin Fowler.’ Intriguingly, the source added: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s not been seen because he is going out in public wearing a disguise. He’s spent his life transforming himself into other characters – why not now?’Certainly, the star has not been seen at any of the homes in his international property portfolio.Spacey is said to have visited New York since the scandal broke but stayed with a ‘wealthy friend’ connected with the theatre world.A doorman at Spacey’s former Manhattan home – now sold – said: ‘We’ve not seen him here for a long time, well before the scandal.’Another former associate suggested he is ‘hiding in plain sight’ in a rented ranch in Thousand Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles which recently suffered a double tragedy of a mass shooting and a wildfire.‘Kevin’s been staying at a friend’s place in Thousand Oaks,’ the associate said. ‘He’s become a hermit and never goes out.’The actor has also not been seen at his £2.3 million London flat.With the exception of Spacey’s estranged brother Randy, not one person was prepared to go on the record to discuss the star.One person who worked closely with Spacey claims to have received a call from the actor in which he was ‘genuinely baffled that everyone has turned their backs on him’.‘He doesn’t understand why no one has stuck up for him,’ the colleague said. ‘He sounded quite indignant.’But no one else, it seems, is surprised. ‘It’s typical Hollywood, no one will say a word about him because he’s just too toxic,’ his elder brother Randy, 62, said yesterday. ‘My brother was always an arrogant p**** and now karma has come round to bite him in the butt.‘He was the goose who kept laying the golden eggs, so people protected him. Of course people close to him knew about his extra-curricular activities, but while he was making money they turned a blind eye.’Randy has had no contact with his famous sibling for 15 years after giving an interview about their childhood which he says sent his ‘control freak’ brother ‘ballistic’. But he says he believes that Spacey is ‘lying low’ in the belief the ‘water will cool’.

Pictured: The sun sets behind the Palace of Westminster today But Mrs May has vowed to fight on, saying the plotters\u0027 plans did not address the Irish border issue. Mr Corbyn has faced calls from grassroots Labour members to back a second referendum but the party leadership has so far preferred to push for a new election.  Adam Drummond, Opinium\u0027s head of political polling, said: \u0027With the country almost as ided as on referendum day two-and-a-half years ago, it\u0027s no surprise that we find ourselves in a messy situation now that the actual form of Brexit has been announced.\u0027The backlash against the deal, similar to that against Chequers in July, has seen Leavers start to flee the Conservatives, giving the Tories their lowest vote share since Theresa May became Prime Minister.\u0027There are two bits of good news for Theresa May though. The first is that Jeremy Corbyn is seen to have responded to Brexit even more poorly than the PM has.\u0027The second is that while her deal is nobody\u0027s first choice, it is almost everybody\u0027s second choice.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions on Wednesday, has seen his party take a four-point lead in one opinion poll. He has so far not backed calls for a second referendum \u0027Her challenge is that Remainers and Leavers both believe that their ideal outcome is still on the table and the best way of achieving it is to vote down her deal and take their chances.\u0027Opinium\u0027s poll found just a fifth (21 per cent) feel Mrs May\u0027s deal should be accepted, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) saying Britain should leave without a deal.   More than half the respondents (52 per cent) disapproved of her handling of the negotiations, but a similar number (50 per cent) said they also disapprove of Mr Corbyn\u0027s response to Brexit.There was some backing for Mrs May in the ComRes poll, with almost half of those polled saying she should remain as Prime Minister at least until Britain leaves the European Union, including three quarters of Conservative voters.There was bad news for some of her possible challengers, with just eight per cent of voters wanting Mr Gove to take over if Mrs May steps down.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt fared little better on 10 per cent, with high profile Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg on 17 per cent. "},{"url":null,"title":"Palace insiders reveal Hurricane Meghan shaking Royals","story":"    Ripping up the rulebook: Meghan, pictured with Harry on their wedding dayAs The Mail on Sunday reveals today, the new Duchess of Sussex has wasted no time in putting her stamp on The Firm. Determined to do things her way from the moment she bounces out of bed at 5am, she has proved to be less of a breath of fresh air and more of a whirlwind.In fact, ‘Hurricane Meghan’ is ripping up the rulebooks on everything from fashion to friendships, diplomacy to the etiquette of car doors (the Duchess shuts her own). Here, we explore a few of the changes she has brought to the House of Windsor…REWRITING THE ROYAL FASHION RULESThe Queen is said to have expressed surprise that Meghan, a orcee, wore quite such a white dress for her wedding – an elegant boat-necked creation from fashion house Givenchy. But then the future Duchess of Sussex was always going to do it (or more pertinently wear it) her own way.It’s a boldness that has led to unease among some courtiers.‘Meghan is being told she needs to start dressing less like a Hollywood star and more like a Royal,’ a source from one of the fashion teams which has visited Kensington Palace told The Mail on Sunday.The Dukes and Duchesses sneak off to \u0027secret\u0027 dinner date:...EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Harry and Meghan \u0027may leave their...Share this articleIt seems unlikely to happen: from the moment she first stepped out in public with her future husband, Meghan has unstuffily defied Royal convention, whether with her penchant for non-British designers or her fondness for wearing black – traditionally worn by Royals only to signify mourning.No-one gave that memo to Meghan, who in August not only wore a black tuxedo to a special performance of the musical Hamilton, but caused a further frisson by displaying bare legs a good few inches above the knee.It is said this rebellious spirit has resulted in raised eyebrows from the Queen, who is a stickler for the rules.While she and Meghan are understood to have a warm relationship, a degree of tension was reported between the pair during their trip to Runcorn, Cheshire, in June. Meghan declined to wear a hat after apparently failing to understand that when the Queen’s aides informed her the Queen would be wearing one, that meant Meghan should follow suit.          The Duchess of Sussex did not follow the Queen\u0027s example of wearing a hat at an official functionSHAKING UP THE PALACE FLUNKIESSix or seven a day – that’s the number of texts the new Duchess of Sussex sends to palace aides with ideas and requests.She’s an early riser, up at 5am rain or shine, and it is said palace staff have never experienced anything remotely like Meghan’s formidable work ethic, matched only by the incessant stream of ideas about how to shape her role. Quite aside from her publicised engagements, Meghan has been conducting a series of ‘undercover’ missions to meet the British people, particularly those associated with good causes.Well-meaning as she is, her particular brand of ‘up and at ’em’ West Coast energy is an uncomfortable fit with the more formal ethos of some palace staff.Meghan has joined the Royal Family at a time when several aides have moved on, including senior communications secretary Katrina McKeever – a point of liaison for Meghan’s family – who quietly left the Kensington Palace press office in September. In April, it was announced that Edward Lane Fox, Harry’s right-hand man of the past five years, would be leaving earlier than many expected.And in the past few days, it was reported that one of Meghan’s aides, a woman said to be called ‘Melissa’, has departed.Some who remain, meanwhile, conduct themselves in ways that might seem unorthodox: Meghan’s private assistant secretary was filmed appearing to shove a photographer away from her boss on the recent Australia tour.A NEW LONDON HOME FOR THE PARENTS-TO-BE?          Harry and Meghan attend a \u0027Hamilton\u0027 Gala performance in Victoria Palace Theatre, LondonWilliam and Harry, the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex, are considering a ‘formal ision’ of their joint royal household at Kensington Palace, according to recent reports. The split would create separate courts to reflect their increasingly different responsibilities.Meanwhile, there’s speculation over where Harry and Meghan – with a baby on the way in the spring – will make their London home. Up until now, it’s been widely expected the Sussexes would move from their current two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage into Kensington Palace’s lavish 21-room Apartment 1 – right next door to William and Kate’s huge home.But now there’s a ner in the works – the incumbents, the Duke of Gloucester and his wife Birgitte, are said to want to stay put – and there’s talk of Harry and Meghan moving further afield to St James’s Palace. Meanwhile, there is talk there have been tensions between the two couples behind the scenes – and in particular between Meghan and Kate. Malicious gossip? Very possibly. What female friendship is without its sharp edges?Meghan can be assured of one close and important ally: Prince Charles has bonded with his new daughter-in-law – as a result of their shared experience of growing up in a dysfunctional family.Royal biographer Angela Levin spent a year following the prince ahead of his 70th birthday. And, as she revealed in The Mail on Sunday, an immaculate source close to the prince has told her: ‘There have been so many traumas and crises within the personal life of the Royal Family, from the Duke of Windsor onwards. And many royal orces.‘That’s why the Duchess’s troubled family background has endeared her to Charles even more.’MEET ALL OF MY HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS‘We have known each other a long time, but we really are relying on each other a lot recently.’ These were the words uttered recently by tennis champion Serena Williams about her close relationship with Meghan.It’s a clear indication that the new Duchess is determined to sprinkle star dust on The Firm. Under her direction, the old money and even older lineage that traditionally formed part of the Royal Family’s inner circle has been joined by sports stars and A-listers. One look at the Royal Wedding guest list made it abundantly clear just how much Meghan was transforming the landscape: Serena was just one of a number of entertainment figures to make their way into St George’s Chapel.          Well-meaning as she is, her particular brand of ‘up and at ’em’ West Coast energy is an uncomfortable fit with the more formal ethos of some palace staffOthers included Idris Elba, James Corden, American chat show queen Oprah Winfrey – who spent an afternoon doing yoga with Meghan’s mother Doria in the run-up to the wedding – and George and Amal Clooney.The Clooneys are said to be so close to the new royal couple that they played host to Meghan and Harry at their opulent Lake Como villa in August.INTRODUCING TEAM MEGHANIt\u0027s no surprise, given her resolute sense of self, that Meghan continues to lean on a non-official team of advisers, comprising a group of devoted close friends who have helped – and continue to help – with every aspect of her transition to royal life, from planning her wedding to organising her wardrobe for her first royal tour.Lindsay Roth, one of Meghan’s oldest friends since the pair met in a literature class at Northwestern University in Illinois, is one of her closest allies and has recently been seen in the Kensington area. Author Lindsay, 36, based a character in her 2015 novel, What Pretty Girls Are Made Of, on Meghan.Then, of course, there is Jessica Mulroney, her best friend.A well-connected stylist based in Canada, Jessica has been especially close to Meghan since the pair met on the set of Suits some years ago.          Quite aside from her publicised engagements, Meghan has been conducting a series of ‘undercover’ missions to meet the British people, particularly those associated with good causesShe is believed to have offered important assistance to Meghan in the run-up to her wedding, even though Meghan and Harry had two leading events organisers and catering firms helping them.It was Jessica she called to discuss every element of the day, from the dress to the flowers and the photography.Fast forward a few months and it was once again Jessica who helped the Duchess pick outfits for the tour of Australia.Meghan’s mother Doria, meanwhile, is playing an ever more strategic role. She made two significant visits to see her daughter over the summer, staying at the Sussexes’ rented home in the Cotswolds, and is said to be considering moving to Britain full-time when her grandchild is born.AND THEIR COSY COUNTRY RETREATThe new Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s choice of country home says much about the couple’s new alliances.While the Queen is thought to have gifted the couple the private and secluded York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, the couple have also signed a two-year lease on a property on a 400-acre estate in the Cotswolds, close to celebrity mecca Soho Farmhouse, where they have been pictured more than once.Meghan was spotted there on visits to Britain before she made her permanent move."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC women stars say Andrew Neil apologise mad cat woman jibe","story":"    Andrew Neil referred to a journalist as a \u0027mad cat woman\u0027Furious women stars at the BBC have demanded that politics presenter Andrew Neil apologise and called his impartiality into question after he mocked a female journalist as a ‘mad cat woman’.The broadcaster posted his comment last week about Observer reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has led investigations into the pro-Brexit campaign’s funding and use of social media, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal.He has since deleted the tweet, which referred to her as that ‘mad cat woman from Simpsons, Karol Kodswallop’.The post referred to a character in the US cartoon series, but also echoed Leave.EU funder Arron Banks\u0027 earlier tweet calling Cadwalladr a ‘sad cat lady’.

Although I would call it sexist rather than misogynist.‘But I think many BBC people have quite a lot of sympathy for the frustrations contained within the tweet. For a good investigative journalist she does seem to spend and indeed waste an inordinate amount of time trolling the BBC.’After deleting the offending post, Neil retweeted a statement from the BBC press office which read: ‘There has been some discussion on here regarding a tweet from Andrew Neil about Carole Cadwalladr. He has deleted the tweet and recognises it was inappropriate.’          The broadcaster posted his comment last week about Observer reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has led investigations into the pro-Brexit campaign’s funding and use of social media, including the Cambridge Analytica scandalThe timing of the tweets is particularly embarrassing because they were posted the day before Lord Hall, the BBC’s Director-General said he was appalled by the abuse BBC journalists such as political editor Laura Kuenssberg received on Twitter.Neil’s critics have contrasted his ‘lenient’ treatment with the BBC’s decision earlier this year to take a number of women off air for ‘impartiality reasons’ after they tweeted support for equal pay at the Corporation.Cadwalladr yesterday tweeted that she had received private messages of support from both male and female journalists at the BBC.She wrote: ‘The lifeblood – the journalists – of our public service broadcaster do an amazing job every single day. It’s the weird decisions made at the top that are troubling.’The BBC News Channel show Newswatch yesterday addressed the controversy, airing the opinions of two viewers critical of Neil. One asked: ‘Why is Andrew Neil still on air.’ The other said the tweet was ‘offensive and misogynistic’.Neil did not respond to requests for comment from this newspaper.A BBC spokesman last night said: ‘Andrew acknowledges that the tweet was inappropriate, and it was removed shortly after it was posted. The tweet was sent from Andrew’s personal account, however the BBC has social media guidelines which it expects all staff to follow and these have been discussed with Andrew.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Whistleblower teacher makes shocking claim autistic","story":"    According to a teacher most of the youngsters undergoing a gender transformation are autisticIt means that 150 autistic teenagers were given puberty blocker drugs which stop the body maturing.The teacher says she felt compelled to speak out to protect pupils, many of whom she believes could already be taking the powerful drugs and may go on to have life-changing surgery. She believes schools and some politicians have swallowed ‘hook, line and sinker’ a politically-correct ‘fallacy’ peddled by a powerful transgender lobby.

It is horrendous that children are being encouraged by other pupils to identify as transgender, particularly if they have autism.          The Mail on Sunday can reveal that 17 pupils at a single British school are in the process of changing gender. Pictured: Anna Friel and Callum Booth-Ford in the drama Butterfly‘Parents are not told about this and there is no way of challenging these pupils who are convinced by others that they have a problem they almost certainly do not have. Tragically the end result could be irreversible surgical procedures. This is scandalous.’The teacher, who has her own child, also believes many of those who say they are the wrong sex are simply gay but would face bullying if they were to ‘come out’. By contrast, she says, transgender children at the school are idolised by other pupils.She has also raised concerns that many teachers are now too scared to challenge students’ claims they are transgender because they fear being sacked or sued for being transphobic.The 17 pupils now identifying as transgender are following in the footsteps of a teenager who has now left the school and is planning a double mastectomy.That student, who was born female, told Carol she wanted to identify as non-binary-a person – with no specific gender – in January 2014, at the age of 16 and two years after being diagnosed as autistic.After consulting with her parents, the school agreed to change the student’s name on the register to one that was gender neutral. Teachers also agreed to use both male and female pronouns depending what gender the student identified as on any given day. ‘These pronouns could change from hour to hour depending how the student was feeling,’ Carol said.Carol put the pupil in contact with a transgender support group but now says she bitterly regrets her handling of the case. ‘That child was diagnosed as autistic at the age of 14 and certainly was not transgender,’ she said. ‘She had other complicated mental health problems. It is a tragedy her claim was accepted so readily. Now she is going to mutilate her body.’Over the next four years, the 17 pupils who have ‘come out’ as transgender have become powerful within the school, Carol says.They wear identical clothing and hairstyles and often adopt the names of transgender YouTube stars. She has also witnessed first-hand how older pupils have persuaded younger ones with autism that they, too, were born the wrong sex – a process she has likens to ‘grooming’.‘They are just young people with mental health problems who have found an identity and want to be part of a group of like-minded people,’ she said.   I’ve seen girls who’ve changed gender groom younger ones to do the same... and in nearly every case they are autistic, says school teacher  Over an unblemished teaching career ning two decades, Carol has devoted much of her time to the emotional and personal well-being of the pupils in her care.So when a 16-year-old student she had known for many years quietly confided that she felt trapped in the wrong body and was considering changing gender, her instinct was to take the teenager lovingly under her wing.Even though Carol knew the child had been diagnosed as autistic two years earlier, she vowed to provide the support the youngster needed to guide her through what would obviously be a difficult journey.It was January 2014 and the debate over transgender rights, so supercharged today, had barely begun. The baffling array of terminology used to define various permutations of so-called ‘gender identity’ was yet to emerge and Carol admits she didn’t know where to turn for help.But then, because she was in charge of pupils’ pastoral care, Carol was contacted by an organisation that aimed to help transgender youngsters. The body, which Carol has asked us not to name because she fears doing so might identify her and the pupil, had recently opened a centre nearby.The student, who was born female, had insisted that she now wanted to identify as non-binary – a person with no specific gender – so Carol happily referred her to the group. But the gently spoken mother has come to bitterly regret that decision.          The teacher said she felt compelled to speak out to protect pupils, many of whom she believes could already be taking the powerful drugs      Since 2011, specialists at The Tavistock Centre’s Gender Identity Development Service in London have seen more than 1,000 under-18sI have been a psychotherapist for more than 30 years and, in that time, I have worked with a small but significant number of patients who wished to change gender.For everyone’s sake, I believe that surgery – which is irreversible – should only ever be a last resort. We should always begin by working to help the mind fit better with the body before we start altering the body to fit the mind.Yet in today’s NHS, professionals are enabling hundreds – possibly thousands – of teenagers to have major surgery to change their gender.It is being done, almost unchallenged, in the name of transgender rights. But in 20 years’ time, I believe we will look back on this folly as one of the darkest periods in the history of modern medicine.We will question why we failed to challenge their belief that they were born in the ‘wrong’ bodies.We will ask why we so readily ignored the clanging alarm bells that many were autistic, or had mental health problems.What we are faced with today is extremely worrying. While 17 children are transitioning in one secondary school, be in no doubt – it is almost certainly being repeated in other schools. What is happening is this: we are bringing up a generation of children who have quite complex mental health issues.Identifying as trans can feel like a way to explain that suffering. Rather than understanding where it might be coming from – feeling lonely or isolated, being bullied, having an autistic spectrum disorder or struggling with any number of issues from sexuality to abuse to self-harm – we are allowing them to change sex.It’s a lazy and damaging solution and one which NHS professionals, teachers, politicians and the law are all too eager to embrace to signal their progressive views.In 2015, I published a prize- winning but controversial paper examining whether therapy could replace some patients’ perceived need for surgery.Personally, I believe that as a society we should celebrate gender variance. Some of my patients have been able to live creatively with the mismatch between their mind and body. Where that isn’t possible – and where a patient is obviously suffering – we should always do something about it.Yet the debate on this issue has been silenced by transgender activists who label as ‘transphobic’ anyone who dares to challenge their dogma.This blind adherence to ideology has real, dangerous consequences.In my field, for example, many psychotherapists are now afraid to properly question a patient who identifies as trans: afraid to explore their past, ask questions of their sexuality, or look into their mental health. They won’t go there, for fear of being struck off.One major problem in today’s blinkered reality is that, if you don’t ‘affirm’ a patient’s claim to be transgender, you can run the risk of being accused of practising ‘conversion therapy’.Conversion therapy is the practice of trying to convince a homosexual person that they are really straight. It’s abhorrent, and is rightly banned. Now, powerful bodies including the NHS and major counselling organisations have signed a Memorandum of Understanding – an agreement on how to practise – which extends the definition of conversion therapy to cover patients who might be transgender.And this well-meaning memorandum is being used by trans activists to stop therapists, psychologists and others from asking rigorous questions about whether or not a patient does, in fact, have genuine ‘gender dysphoria’.A therapist might have good cause to believe that the trans-identifying teenage boy in front of them hates his body because he was abused as a child and feels vulnerable. But they can’t explore that possibility.They might spot a pattern of several schoolgirls saying they are trans, after witnessing a peer transformed from social non-entity to social butterfly after identifying as a trans-boy.The attraction of popularity should not be overlooked.Yet none of these possibilities can now be safely raised by psychotherapists, psychiatrists or teachers. Recently, 650 trans activists signed a letter published in Therapy Today, the house magazine of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy, calling on anyone not practising ‘affirmation therapy’ to be booted out. If the Government presses ahead with plans to allow people to ‘self- identify’ as whatever gender they like, without external validation, I fear that would strengthen the hand of those arguing for trans-affirmative therapy.But in my view, to avoid asking such probing questions of patients who claim to be trans – especially teenagers – is a cowardly dereliction of our duty.We abdicate our responsibility if we simply become their Yes men, just passing them on to the next stage of the sex-change process.The danger is that, once on the medical pathway which leads to a sex change, it’s very hard to get off.Youngsters referred to the Gender Identity Development Service run by The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London undergo just six sessions to assess whether or not they are trans. Several members of staff have told me they are quietly appalled that, too often, no psychotherapy is offered before they start medical treatment.They are then given ‘puberty blocker’ drugs which halt physical developments – powerful medicines not even licensed for transgender treatment which we know can weaken the bones, perhaps for life. There is little long-term data on their safety yet the NHS routinely hands them out.Then most will receive cross-sex hormones, which carry their own risks. Giving testosterone to females, for instance, can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.Exactly how many make the full surgical transition to the ‘opposite’ sex is unclear. Whether it brings lasting happiness is even less so. Short-term studies, usually conducted soon after surgery, suggest patients are immediately happier. But the few long-term studies that exist paint a different picture.One, which followed men who had transitioned to be women for 15 to 20 years after surgery, showed they had a 20-times higher risk of suicide than others matched for age, social class and mental health problems.On YouTube, some transsexuals are now posting videos warning young people not to go ahead with reassignment.The backlash has begun.It surely can’t be long before more difficult questions will be asked by a new generation. They will ask why nobody stopped them, told them treatment could destroy their sex life – or warned them that it would make them infertile and might not make them happy after all. They might also have lawyers asking the same questions, eyeing millions of pounds in compensation.We need some honesty now, free from political correctness.Otherwise, we are heading towards catastrophe. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tory HQ high alert snap General Election","story":"    The Conservative Party are considering a snap General Election if Theresa May, pictured, fails to get enough support for her Brexit plan in parliament           Several Tory backbenchers are on manoeuvers in an attempt to undermine the PM\u0027s position          Mrs May is fighting for her political life in an effort to remain at Number 10 this weekend She would go to the country for a ‘Brexit Election’ on the ticket of securing a mandate for a new negotiating platform with the European Union.

The ceremony was held in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament)          The two leaders showed unity as they arrived and sat near to each other during the ceremonyThere is much frustration in Paris about Merkel\u0027s perceived foot-dragging on Macron\u0027s bold reform plans, especially on forging a eurozone with a major common budget and finance minister.The two countries agreed Friday on the outlines of a proposed budget for the euro area, Macron\u0027s flagship project to support investment, but not on the amount, which remains undefined.Another area of contention is that Germany and France have so far failed to find a united strategy on EU efforts to introduce a digital tax on internet giants such as Google and Facebook.The joint army plan, too, faces tricky challenges, including post-war Germany\u0027s traditional reluctance to send combat troops abroad and the fact that parliament must approve military missions. "},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle book Shadows Duchess released Meghan gives birth","story":"    Samantha Markle (pictured in May this year) is promising to hijack the birth of her sister Meghan\u0027s baby with an explosive tell-all book Royals face \u0027tax nightmare\u0027 as US officials use Meghan\u0027s...Getting up at 5am, bombarding aides with texts and her...The Dukes and Duchesses sneak off to \u0027secret\u0027 dinner date:...Share this articleShe told the Daily Star: \u0027In The Shadows Of The Duchess covers everything… the world does not know truth total truth… (I\u0027m) holding nothing back!

Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which sold for $90.3m (£70.3m) at auction in New York last week, shows his former lover and muse standing beside a pool – and a man who might be the painter’s new boyfriend swimming under water.But Peter Schlesinger, Hockney’s ex-partner who was one of his students at the University of California, Los Angeles, has rejected the interpretation of the work that has now made the Yorkshire-born painter the world’s most highly valued living artist. He says it is not an “emotional” depiction – and is probably not even, in any meaningful sense, a portrait of him.“It’s an amazing picture, and it contains his two most iconic genres in one picture, swimming pools and double-portraiture, but I can’t speak to its emotional element because I don’t think it is emotional,” Schlesinger told the Observer. “There’s the figure of me standing and the figure in the water differently painted. It was a conceptual problem. I don’t even think it’s a portrait of me, really.”Schlesinger, a ceramicist who recently published two acclaimed photography books describing London’s creative milieu of the early 1970s, believes the more elaborate romantic interpretations of the painting could only be made “with hindsight”.But the interpretations persist, with New York Times critic Roberta Smith describing the painting last year as “a complex, emotion drama inspired by a personal relationship”.When the 1972 painting went under the hammer at Christie’s, dethroning Jeff Koons as the most expensive living artist, bidding went on for nine minutes, a testament to Hockney’s growing critical and commercial stature.Christie’s described it as “one of the great masterpieces of the modern era”. The auction house did not disclose the identities of either the buyer or the seller, but it was reported that the painting had belonged to the Bahamas-based British currency trader Joe Lewis, whose company owns Tottenham Hotspur football club. Lewis is believed to have amassed an art collection worth $1bn, including work by Picasso, Matisse, Bacon and Freud.Hockney, now 81, staged the swimming portraits at the Provençal villa of the filmmaker Tony Richardson, Le Nid du Duc – “the owl’s nest”. But Schlesinger was nowhere near the pool he posed for the portrait, fully clothed and in London’s Kensington Gardens, while the picture itself was executed during a three-month work binge after the two men broke up.In the picture, the Schlesinger figure is dressed in a pink jacket overlooking a sun-dappled swimming pool. A range of mountains rises up as a backdrop. The swimmer is thought to be Hockney’s new lover, Eric Boman. But Schlesinger just sees it as “a great painting”.Hockney’s break-up with Schlesinger in the early 1970s was chronicled in the 1974 film A Bigger Splash, which takes its title from the artist’s best-known Californian swimming pool picture.The sale of Portrait of An Artist came as the flow of established masterworks to market slows to a trickle. But when they do come up, the competition is intense.Days before the sale, Edward Hopper’s 1929 painting Chop Suey sold for $91.9m, with fees, an auction record for the artist. The previous best price for Hopper, set in 2013, was less than half, at $40.5m.Schlesinger believes Hockney’s moment has finally come: “David has always been a very popular artist but his values weren’t in line with that. Now his prices are catching up with his reputation.”Hockney’s increasing popularity may in part also be due to an acclaimed 2017 retrospective at Tate Britain and New York’s politan Museum of Art. The show received praise from Smith of the New York Times for making clear Hockney’s “courageous” representation of homosexual love and comradeship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36562b61b4ad55201d781dbb38c508893951b1d7/0_0_6000_8010/master/6000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bf83174a3e9c7cb2b03d74a447e29644 1440w","title":"recycling the old masters in pictures suzanne jongmans","story":"Dutch artist Suzanne Jongmans creates photographs that echo the old masters, but with a modern twist: she crafts intricate costumes using recycled plastics, old blankets and used packaging.

We need to have a sayIt is our fate, and arguably our misfortune, to live in an era of great change. Yet even by recent standards, the political upheavals of the past week have surpassed in intensity and gravity almost anything the British people have experienced in the postwar era. The long, often tedious and confusing struggle for Brexit suddenly crystallised into an all-consuming political drama of epic proportions, riveting, infuriating and alarming in equal measures. Bodies litter the stage. The plots and subplots thicken. On all sides the cry goes up of treason and betrayal. But still, if we are honest – and now is a time for honesty – nobody knows how or where this tragedy, this black farce in which we gamble with a nation’s life, will end.Line by line, clause by clause, the reality of Brexit was finally committed to dry, unforgiving paper. Every page of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May demolished the stubborn fantasy to which she has clung over the past two years: that there is barely a trade-off to make in leaving the EU, and that we could painlessly slide out of the world’s largest, deepest trading bloc. Every sentence brought into sharp focus the colossal cost of embracing the Brexiters’ delusion of “taking back control”, measured not just in lost billions but in the damage to be inflicted on British citizens, on sovereignty and influence.The agreement is probably the best Britain could have achieved, given the twin constraints under which May has operated: the absolute necessity to safeguard the Northern Ireland peace process, and her insistence on ending free movement. Unless we reach a comprehensive trade deal that avoids the need for a hard border in Ireland – almost impossible to envisage, given that there are no workable solutions outside the customs union, and the government rightly will not countenance border checks in the Irish Sea – Britain will eventually enter the backstop arrangement outlined in the agreement, which can be exited only by mutual agreement.This is the economics of the madhouse. But the Brexit foreshadowed in the deal unveiled last week will leave Britain vastly diminished in other significant ways. In arguing that leaving will boost British sovereignty, the Brexiters coddled themselves in 19th-century imperial fantasies. Here in the 21st century, virtually all the major challenges faced by developed nations are global: climate change, microbial resistance, regulating the tech giants, to name just some. They will be solved only through international collaboration, and while the EU is far from perfect it is by far the most successful model the world has seen. To leave at a time when the world is getting darker when we have a fiercely nationalist, anti-global US president who is openly contemptuous of Britain when trade wars are the new norm when Russia is more insurgent than at any time since the cold war is nothing short of lunacy, a terrible act of national self-immolation.While May’s negotiation can hardly be termed a success, the bigger failure is one of political leadership. The Boris Johnsons of this world may be the Tory party’s deluders-in-chief. But May herself has much to answer for. Where she should have taken on the hard Brexiters, she channelled their reactionary sentiments – not in the national interest but in the interests of holding together her ided party. Where we desperately needed unifying, consensual statesmanship, she unilaterally renounced Britain’s membership of the single market and customs union, thereby creating inflexible “red lines” despite the lack of any democratic mandate to do so.The withdrawal agreement should make abundantly clear that there is no such thing as a clean break from the EU that respects both the integrity of the UK and the Good Friday agreement. Therein lies the Brexit conundrum. The Brexiters refuse to confront it they simply pretend it does not exist. They have abdicated all responsibility for achieving their dream, split between flouncing out of the top jobs and staying in the cabinet to pretend they can rewrite the agreement as they see fit. They remain defined by their futile oppositionalism, their inability to put forward a vision or a plan.May’s chances of getting her deal through parliament look vanishingly small. Not just because – despite genuflecting to them for months – she cannot carry her party’s Eurosceptics. Labour, bar a handful of rebels, looks certain to oppose the deal.It is right to do so. But Labour, too, has failed abysmally to give the country the political leadership it needs. The six tests Labour has said it will apply to any deal mirror the unreality of the Leave campaign, making no acknowledgement of the trade-offs Brexit forces us to confront, between controlling migration and having access to the single market. Labour has zeroed in on process, not substance. Its only firm Brexit position is to fight for a general election that would allow a future Labour government to renegotiate the terms of our withdrawal – an election that Tory and DUP MPs will certainly not grant under the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Given the incoherence of the tests, it is unclear on what basis it would be trying to renegotiate.This paper has long made the principled case for a referendum on any exit deal. Far from establishing the “will of the people”, the referendum created a democratic deficit: a narrow margin in favour of leaving the EU, but with no mandate dictating the terms and cost of such. The Leave campaigns – both of which we now know broke electoral law – fed the public misinformation and untruths: the idea we could somehow seize back control and get richer in the process, freeing up cash for the NHS, all without jeopardising the union. We cannot make sense of the 2016 result without a second-stage referendum on the terms of our exit.Now, given that we expect there to be no parliamentary majority for the deal, there is also an urgent practical need for a referendum. It is the only route through the political gridlock that is likely to ensue, the only way of resolving the damaging stasis we confront. Nor is there any space for a “no deal” option on the ballot: the choice must be between the status quo or a shambolic, lose-lose deal.Support for a referendum on the terms of our exit is gathering fast. But the most common argument against, from those who might otherwise lend their support, is that to open the way for a vote reversing the 2016 referendum would be to risk a popular backlash and a further deepening of political isions.This is an abdication of leadership, from politicians too fearful to take on the populists at their own game. It’s a continuation of the argument deployed to bring us to the dreadful place we find ourselves in today, and if we continue to capitulate to populism, we will face worse. Populism festers when our political leaders concede to scapegoating without a fight. Populism festers when those leaders decide that those they represent are too stupid to grapple with real-world complexity.There is a watertight case for a referendum on the deal: we now know the terms of exit, there are huge unforeseen costs, and the public must have a say. We need our politicians to make that case. If they don’t, the popular backlash in years to come will be far worse than anything we have seen hitherto. Brexit will deepen inequalities, sharpen resentments and sabotage our chances of meeting the big challenges we face, from an ageing population to climate change, to the changing world of work. Brexit will not quell the populist beast: it will feed it.The stakes have never been higher. Now, more than ever, we need our politicians to step up. No more ultra-nationalist fantasising no more Tory denial and lies. No more Labour hedging of bets, and hiding behind the political sofa. Don’t run scared of the populists who say a referendum would polarise the nation. Don’t give up, to the detriment of those who can least afford further economic pain. Now is the time for political bravery and a realistic vision of a workable, sustainable, unifying future for this country. The Brexit tragedy is not inevitable. Now is the time to give us, the people, a say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/287cb5d736056972c28bd59075570a12aaa5cc2b/0_127_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc854b3025fde8dffda7ee12adce1c2","title":"gaslighting gammon year buzzwords oxford dictionaries","story":"In the space of a single week I have, without overly noticing at the time, accused someone of “gaslighting” me for being excessively cheerful on the phone when I thought sobriety was required described to someone else an intention to do a “hard reset on my boundaries” after I was kept waiting and didn’t adequately protest complained about the “toxic” atmosphere introduced after an argument and outlined what I considered to be the problematic “centring”, within a conversation, of certain issues at the expense of other, more important issues.The takeaway from this, apart from the fact that I am a very fun person to be around, is that none of these descriptors are words I would have used even five years ago – a fact born out by the Oxford Dictionaries’ announcement this week of their most popular words of the year. “Toxic” came out top for the sheer breadth of its usage – starting, as noted in the New York Times, with the widespread uptake of “toxic masculinity” in the wake of #MeToo, and from there spreading outwards to encompass every shade of dysfunctional relationship.Other shortlisted words included “gaslighting”, “incel” and, more surprisingly, “gammon” – defined by the dictionary for the benefit of American audiences as a word “typically used in the UK as a derogatory term for an older middle-class white man whose face becomes flushed due to anger when expressing political (typically rightwing) opinions”.Many of these words have their roots in political or activist circles and, unlike the dictionary’s previous words of the year – for example, neutral descriptors such as “glamping” or “vape” – seem expressly to reflect the heightened emotional and political state in which many of us are currently living.Aesthetically, they are also quite ugly. When I bang on about toxicity or gaslighting, I notice in myself a tendency towards a tone of wounded officiousness, which may be justified or not, but either way has a sort of strangulating effect, even as it expands the range of what I might adequately describe.And this is the complaint about these sorts of terms, of course. The Oxford Dictionaries might just have easily gone for “rape culture”, or “trigger warning”, or “microaggression” in its shortlist, descriptors that act on some with the force of a hostile ideology and are considered less facilitators of subtle political or personal states and more gateways to lazy forms of reasoning that undermine critical engagement.So it is with modish political terms until they are worn down to a state of normalisation, so that for once, it seems to me, the word of the year has real purchase. As a 15-year-old, I recall reading Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique and flipping out as she described her frustration, in the 1950s, at not being able to name the specific cause of the drudgery and awfulness of her life, finally hitting on a radical new term: “sexism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd675f95cd2d564bb0649054dbc0981c14cdc795/120_433_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=621c859c1b9319cbbd614cee8a0badc5","title":"patriotism meaningless without acts of defiance","story":"Emmanuel Macron was wrong to see love of country as chiefly a gentle sentimentNationalism, the French president Emmanuel Macron suggested at last week’s Armistice commemoration in Paris, “is a betrayal of patriotism”.The phrase made the headlines, not least because it was seen as a rebuke to Donald Trump, who was also attending the ceremony. It caught the imagination, too, because it spoke to a contemporary dilemma: how to assuage the widespread sense that societies are becoming more incohesive without encouraging nationalist fervour.For Macron, nationalism is exclusive, aggressive, ideological. Patriotism is a felt sentiment of love and decency, of attachment to a place or tradition. It’s a distinction that George Orwell would have appreciated. Patriotism, he suggested in his Notes on Nationalism, expresses “devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people”. It is “defensive, both militarily and culturally”. Nationalism, on the other hand, “is inseparable from the desire for power”.Neither the concepts of nationalism and patriotism, nor the relationship between the two, is, however, as simple as Orwell or Macron describe.Nationalism has always been double-edged. It has helped undermine more parochial isions, allowing people to identify with a collectivity beyond the narrow confines of their immediate community, and establishing institutions that embed democracy. It has also helped institutionalise the distinction between “us” and “them”, entrenching chauvinist ideologies and fostering the idea of homogenous national cultures. Nationalism can be progressive in certain contexts, regressive in others. Equally, patriotism cannot be reduced to a simple sense of attachment to a place or tradition. It is a deeply politicised sentiment and wielded often in isive ways.Consider, for instance, the US controversy over Colin Kaepernick, and other NFL players, “taking the knee” – kneeling, not standing – for the national anthem, in protest at police killings of African Americans.“There’s never been equality for me,  Nor freedom in this ‘homeland of the free’,” wrote Langston Hughes, the great poet of the Harlem renaissance, in Let America be America Again:“O, let America be America again –The land that never has been yet –And yet must be – the land where every man is free.”Kaepernick’s actions echo Hughes’s words, both demanding that America lives up to its professed ideals. Many would view that as a patriotic stance. For critics, however, including Trump, Kaepernick’s protest, and no doubt Hughes’s poem if they knew of it, disrespect America, dishonour the flag and are profoundly unpatriotic.Or take the furore in France over Macron’s decision to celebrate Philippe Pétain for his “greatness” during the First World War, despite having later led the pro-Nazi Vichy regime after German occupation in 1940. Patriotism may be about honouring the past. But how one honours the past, and whom one honours, can be isive questions.If patriotism is politicised, so is anti-patriotism. “That’s unpatriotic” has long been a cry to silence dissent, formally through laws, informally through social pressure. Presenting patriotism as an apolitical sentiment infused with devotion to a place or tradition only makes such silencing easier.Some would question this as a misperception. A Place for Pride, a report published in 2011 by the thinktank Demos, showed, for most people, national pride was embodied less in history or institutions than in simple everyday actions, such as volunteering and helping out in one’s community. What people most valued, and felt pride in, were other people, and their actions.It is this sense of quiet pride that Orwell and Macron see as flowing into patriotism. People are “highly dubious”, the Demos report observed, “of efforts to politicise their everyday, felt patriotic sentiments and they deeply distrust efforts to intellectualise their pride in their country”.Civic pride is an important building block of society. One of the reasons societies feel fragmented today is the erosion of civil society, of the organisations that help foster such pride. To conflate civic pride and patriotism is, however, to denude both of meaning.In many parts of Britain, people have set up food banks, or created community libraries, in response to government cuts. This is civic pride at work. At its heart is undoubtedly a sense of love towards a place and its people. But these are also political acts, even acts of defiance. To describe them as the building blocks of patriotism is to diminish their significance, and, indeed, the political significance of community-building. As Hughes insisted:“O, let my land be a land where LibertyIs crowned with no false patriotic wreath.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17e59f3b955574729dc0120bf1dbff2ff34cbb6/0_1532_3359_2015/master/3359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ee9d61e5c8bcee3426f7a3a4e152748","title":"jeff goldblum mildred snitzer orchestra review cadogan hall","story":"Cadogan Hall, LondonThe Hollywood star imposes his inimitable personality on a set of jazz standards, silkily played in the company of the Mildred Snitzer OrchestraHaving just released his first album at the age of 66, Jeff Goldblum is joyously unschooled in the mechanics of playing for 1,000 people at a time. That’s not to say he is unaccustomed to gigging live – he has had a semi-regular slot at a Los Angeles bar for decades, playing jazz piano when movie commitments permit – but he has never bumped up against the strictures that govern most pro touring musicians. Thus, while promoting the album, The Capitol Studios Sessions, with four sold-out sets, Goldblum runs his show according to his own warm, wonky internal rhythm.So an automated “evacuate the building” alarm is accidentally set off within two minutes of his arrival? No problem: as the audience wonder whether to flee, he chuckles, “Already this is a magical and unforgettable show.” So he feels he doesn’t understand British humour? Fine: a group of fans come up to read out jokes from the Edinburgh festival, allowing him to puzzle at length over expressions such as “jumpers for goalposts”. So the crowd want a closer look at the man in all his amused majesty? During the interval he invites everyone up for an inidual selfie and a chat. He appears genuinely interested in each person.Underpinning all this showmanship is musicianship of a high standard, without which Goldblum wouldn’t be playing under the London jazz festival umbrella. At worst, this set of standards, silkily executed by Goldbum and the five-man Mildred Snitzer Orchestra, could be construed as the highest quality carpool karaoke. Goldblum doesn’t do much soloing often, he’s more an awed sideman, overwhelmed by his bandmates’ fluency. There’s a loose-limbed, roadhouse feel as they slink from Come On-a My House to Autumn Leaves, with a stiffening visit to Marvin Gaye’s Don’t Mess With Mr T en route. “It’s very sexy,” Goldblum advises of the Gaye tune, which it is. It’s also very saxy, and I’m not complaining. But anyone can turn out twilit versions of Autumn Leaves, especially when Imelda May is along to sing them. It’s the Goldblumisms that set this musical side-hustle apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0fca2e7383b2d8e5cd6efb2eab7a1e","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

Some measures the mayor is bringing in will make a bit of a difference but I’m sceptical.”MacFadyen said an increasing number of parents living in urban areas were sufficiently concerned about the issue to consider moving out. “It’s something we hear anecdotally and it’s clear people are increasingly worried about it,” she said. “This trend may be something we see more of in the future.”A series of legal battles brought against the government for failing to tackle air pollution had pushed the issue to the top of people’s consciousness, MacFadyen suggested.Scandals such as those involving carmaker VW had also focused minds – as had the use of technology: canny parents are now using apps to see where a city’s main polluted streets are so that they can avoid them on the walk to school."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bfdd6c66dab9a6bf1da952f6063679c05a80df4/0_0_3000_2127/master/3000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc812c7db607065deeb8d3b15263ec1 700w","title":"christmas taste test 2018 mince pies chocolates cheese","story":"Mince pies, cheese, chocolate, party food – our three wise women guide you through the best high street offeringsCo-op Irresistible Winter Dessert Collection170g, £6, food.coopHard to capture a dessert in a chocolate.

And there is always the temptation to tinker. Food cooked in the oven tends to get on with business itself. Yes, we slide out the Sunday joint to baste it lovingly with the roasting juices and we gingerly test the spring of a cake with a finger, but intervention is less crucial when dinner is cooking behind a closed door.At this time of year I like to put a tray or two of the season’s vegetables and fruits in to bake, some to be eaten whole, others to be transformed into a silky, translucent purée. Wedges of pumpkin and big fat apples, parsnips and pears and Jerusalem artichokes are at their most delicious when they meet the heat of the oven, a little butter and some robust, woody-stemmed herbs. I often cook the ochre roots – carrots, swedes and sweet potatoes – not to eat hot, but to dress with walnut oil and cider vinegar as they come from the oven then tuck away in the fridge. Treasure to plunder over the next few days to be eaten with slices of air-dried hams or smoked mackerel.The flavour is so heightened that I have taken to lightly roasting vegetables and fruit destined for a purée to make the most of their caramelised sweetness. The watchword here is “lightly”. They need to be on the pale side of gold, otherwise their crust will affect the texture of the purée.Apples and pears, whose crisp flesh puffs to a sugary froth in a roasting tin or bakes sweetly under a pastry crust, are useful offerings. Puddings, yes, but also crushed fruit to dip into for breakfast or fold into custard for a fruit fool, whole roasted pears to accompany cold roast pork and chewy crackling or to eat with an amber-coloured cheese or hastily knocked-up caramel sauce for dessert.The flavour of the roast celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes is intensified by a light roasting. The colouring should be no more than a very soft gold.For the mash:celeriac 750gJerusalem artichokes 250gbutter 50ghot vegetable or chicken stock 250mlFor the roast roots:carrots 8, small to mediumparsnips 2garlic 6 clovesbeetroot 4, smallthyme 8 sprigsbutter 75gSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the celeriac and cut it into large pieces, about the size of roast potatoes. Put them in a roasting tin. Peel the Jerusalem artichokes then add to the tin. Dot the butter over the vegetables, season, then roast for about an hour until lightly browned. They mustn’t crisp but instead develop pale gold, lightly caramelised edges. Test for softness – a skewer should slide through with ease.Scrub or peel the carrots and parsnips, cut in half lengthways then put in another roasting tin. Tuck in the garlic cloves, still in their skins, then add the beetroots, trimmed and quartered, with the thyme and butter. Season generously then bake for about an hour, turning once or twice.Tip the roast celeriac and artichokes into a food processor, add some of the stock and reduce to a smooth purée, introducing more of the stock as necessary. Check the seasoning. In a small pan, toast the sunflower seeds over a high heat until they smell nutty, then add the chopped parsley and smoked salt.Spoon the mash on to a serving dish, add the roast vegetables, scatter with the seeds and serve.You only need a small amount of rye bread for the crumble. Use some of the loaf for a stuffing, crumbled into chopped onions softened in butter then mixed with chopped, crisp bacon and pine kernels.For the crust:dark rye bread 100ggolden raisins 6 tbspmixed spice 2 tspbutter 50gcranberries a handfulSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel and core two of the apples and two of the pears then cut into thick segments. Put in a roasting tin. Add the cloves, cinnamon and 6 strips of orange peel.Cut the remaining fruit into segments, coring – but not peeling – as you go, and put in a second tin. Scatter both tins with sugar. Halve the lemon and squeeze its juice over, then dot the butter over the fruit. Bake both trays for 45-50 minutes.Crumble the rye bread into a bowl and stir in the golden raisins and mixed spice. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the rye bread mix and toast over a moderate heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.Take the tray of peeled fruit from the oven.

But one goal would put them into the semi-finals. As Sir Alex Ferguson famously said: The Nations League, bloody hell.79 min Croatia make their final change, with Rog replacing Vlasic.Gomez’s long throw from the right was headed on by Stones towards Kane, who stabbed the ball past Kalinic from close range. Lovren blocked Kane’s shot on the line but could only ert it to Lingard, who ran it into the net from closer than close range.Jesse Lingard scores from 0.0001 yards!77 min Alli’s low cross towards Kane is put behind for a corner. Sancho’s delivery is poor and Croatia clear.76 min Dier is robbed by Brozovic, who leads yet another Croatia counter-attack. Eventually Vlasic’s close-range is crucially blocked by the recovering Dier.74 min Saying which, I think Rashford is injured. He limped straight down the tunnel after leaving the field.73 min England make their final substitutions: Jadon Sancho and Jesse Lingard replace Fabian Delph and Marcus Rashford. That’s harsh on Rashford, who has been England’s liveliest attacker.72 min Croatia look in control at this juncture. England are having loads of the ball but only Rashford has offered any penetration since half-time, and most of that was before the goal. Croatia, by contrast, look extremely dangerous on the counter-attack. Perisic leads another break before his shot is blocked by Gomez.70 min “I realise that this may be considered akin to heresy but is Gareth Southgate allowed to substitute Harry Kane?” says Keith Sanderson. “Is he looking dangerous? Does he look as though he might score? Is he giving the Croatian defenders (one of whom is Lovren for goodness sake) a torrid time? Maybe Lingard could be brought on to add more pace? Just a thought.”I would bring on Sancho and move Rashford central. I’d have considered leaving Kane out of the World Cup semi-final. He looked shattered then, and he’s played another 20-odd games since that match.68 min At this stage of their development, this England team are not great when they go behind. Their heads go down fairly easily. I suppose that’s why experiences like this are so useful.68 min Walker’s well-struck shot from 30 yards is comfortably held by Kalinic. 66 min Brozovic is booked for a foul on Rashford, with Brekalo also booked for something or other.65 min “It’s not bad Raheem,” says David Hindle. “But it’s not good Raheem either, is it? And Harry Kane. I know. But you’re still left asking the question, ‘What’s he doing on the pitch?’, and ‘Is he really any good?” which is quite ridiculous when you think about it. Get Sancho on. And Winks.”Kane’s form is weird. I still can’t get my head around his World Cup, when he was both disappointing and the Golden Boot winner. He looks like he needs a month off.63 min England make their first change, with Dele Alli replacing Ross Barkley.62 min As things stand, Croatia will be going into the semi-finals and England will be relegated. For shame.61 min Another chance for Croatia! Perisic scorches away from Gomez and drives wide of the far post from a tight angle.59 min A mistake from Barkley allows Croatia to break five on four from an England corner. Brozovic plays a one-two with Perisic down the left before hitting a first-time shot into orbit from 18 yards.That goal isn’t just against the run of play it’s an affront to the run of play. The substitute Brekalo played a fine pass infield to Vlasic, who crossed low on the turn to Kramaric at the near post. He kept the ball for what felt like an age, twisting and turning as he tried to work some space to shoot. Eventually he hit a hopeful drive from 15 yards which deflected off Dier and looped over Pickford.England have been mugged on the counter-attack!56 min Walker’s deflected cross almost falls for Rashford, who was shaping to volley when Jedvaj cleared. Moments later, Barkley low shot from 15 yards was blocked excellently by Vida.55 min England need to get the ball to Rashford, who has been electric since half-time.52 min Lovely play from Rashford, who charges 40 yards down the left and flicks a pass to Sterling with the outside of his right foot. Sterling can’t decide whether to shoot first time or control the ball and is challenged on the edge of the area by Milic. His tackle erts the ball towards his own goal, forcing a slightly desperate ing save from the outrushing Kalinic.51 min Modric launches a Croatia counter-attack with an insouciant outside-of-the-foot pass to Kramaric. He plays in the overlapping Perisic, whose low cross from the left of the area is put behind by Gomez.49 min A couple of confident surges from Rashford enliven the crowd. At the moment he is a much better player for England than he is for Manchester United.47 min “Re: Stones and Gomez’s partnership, did we make the most of the recent golden era of English centre-backs?” says Jarrell Anthony. “Despite having John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Jamie Carragher and Sol Campbell, amongst others, to choose from, I can’t remember a consistent, stable partnership that was lauded in the manner of PiqueRamos, for instance. Thoughts?”I think they did make the most of their ability, yeah, certainly at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006. Euro 2004 was slightly different because Ferdinand was suspended and Terry had a bit of an iffy tournament, but generally the problem with that team was that they didn’t score enough and that Wayne Rooney kept getting injured at the worst possible time. As for a stable partnership, from memory it was usually Ferdinand and Campbell from 2001-03, then Ferdinand and Terry from 2004-06.46 min Peep peep! England begin the second half. Croatia have made their second substitution, with Rebic replaced by Josip Brekalo.Peep peep! England should be ahead, but they aren’t. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.45+1 min With the last touch of the half, Modric clips a sweet pass over the defence which just evades Perisic.44 min Rebic wafts wastefully over the bar from 25 yards.43 min Stones sprays a fine crossfield pass to Walker, whose low cutback towards the penalty spot is taken off the toe of Dier by the recovering Brozovic. That was a crucial interception which denied Croatia a goalkick.40 min Chilwell’s deep cross is headed up in the air by Milic at the far post, and Barkley waits patiently for it to drop before swishing a volley into the side netting at the near post. That was a pretty tricky chance.40 min Croatia have calmed the match down after a torrid spell earlier in the half.38 min Gomez is a bit fortunate not to concede a penalty for a late tackle on Kramaric. It would have been soft, in the sense that Kramaric was going nowhere, but on balance it was probably a foul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

I’d much rather go online.”This week more than £10bn will be spent on the Black Friday deals that have come to herald the start of the frenetic festive season. It is retailers’ most lucrative time, but although struggling high streets and shopping centres have pulled out all the stops, many shoppers will not see the light displays and ice rinks – around 20p of every £1 spent this Christmas will not involve a shop visit.Along with other members of Generation Z, Lee, a student from Bromley, south London, has grown up buying clothes from websites that, like her, were born after the millennium. Instead of shopping, high streets are for personal grooming and grabbing a coffee with friends. “I’d much rather spend an evening browsing online than go in a shop,” Lee says. “I get ideas from things I see on TV or from spending hours scrolling through Asos.”In the 20th century the biggest change in shopping habits was the growth of supermarkets. The big stores, with thousands of groceries, crushed the butchers, bakers and greengrocers who had been the backbone of the country’s high streets. This time round it is the internet, with its infinite choice and 24-hour opening, that is taking its toll. And this festive season high street shops, which last week launched an array of sparkling new big-budget Christmas marketing campaigns, fear the worst.“I come to the high street about once a month, and it’s usually only to see someone and go for a drink or food,” says Frankie Marshall, 25, having a catch-up with her mother and a friend in Coffee Revolution in Eastbourne. “It’s too busy, and because the shops are so small you can barely move. I do all my shopping online instead. There’s not a lot of choice around here because some of the shops have closed down. It’ll be better when the new shopping centre opens.”Figures compiled by the Local Data Company show the number of vacant shops, pubs and restaurants in Britain rose by more than 4,400 in the first six months of this year. The pace of decline means more than one in 10 shops now lie empty.Both the retail and restaurant trade are being hit. According to the British Retail Consortium, up to 85,000 jobs disappeared in the first nine months of the year. Big chains including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust, while restaurant groups including Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Byron and Jamie’s Italian have been shutting outlets.The huge shift in behaviour is illustrated by where Britons spend: 10 years ago, 5p of every retail pound was spent online experts predict that figure is heading for 50p. At the same time, retail’s share of overall spending is shrinking as people opt to spend their cash on experiences such as trips to the hairdresser, beauty salon or weekends away. Barbers and beauty salons, together with gyms and vape shops, are among the only retail sectors still growing fast. To stay relevant, shopping centres with strong finances are turning themselves into theme parks with climbing walls, escape rooms and cookery schools – as well as shops.Jake Berry, the high streets minister, told the Observer that the health of the high street was mixed. “It’s not all doom and gloom,” he said. “The high street is always changing. There is no law we can pass to stop people shopping online, nor would we want to.”The recent budget included a £1.5bn package to help struggling high streets, including business rates relief for independent shopkeepers and a £675m fund to back regeneration projects which will launch in 2019. Last week, Berry presided over a Bake Off-style high street contest in which the picturesque Welsh town of Crickhowell crowned the “UK’s best high street”.In Crickhowell, civically minded locals have responded to the seemingly inexorable high street decline with initiatives that included fighting off plans to convert a former pub into a supermarket. Berry said the Usk Valley town was an example of how rural high streets with a big hinterland could “continue to thrive” in an internet age.But retail experts argue that the government business rates changes do not go far enough and do not help struggling giants like Debenhams and Marks \u0026amp Spencer, who are saddled with the highest bills, at a time when other business costs are also going up and sales are leaking online.“I don’t accept cutting a third off the business rates bills of small independent shops doesn’t help. This is about bringing people back on to the high street,” counters Berry.But high-street optimism is scarce. “I think the rate of store closures will accelerate into next year,” says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. “This is a pinch point for retailers struggling with a business model that is not fit for purpose in a digital age.“There are a lot of large retailers with too many stores and fixed costs, such as rent and business rates, don’t go down when customers opt to buy online. There are also extra costs associated with filling these orders.”Several hundred more House of Fraser staff will lose their jobs in the new year after the chain’s new owner, Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, said another four of its stores, including the branches in Newcastle’s  Centre and the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, were to close. At a recent financial update, Marks \u0026amp Spencer refused to rule out more shop closures, because around a third of its stores pre-date the second world war and some are located on ailing high streets. Last year its Christmas sales were a washout, and this year it shifted strategy from a John Lewis-style blockbuster ad to a social media campaign starring Holly Willoughby. The This Morning presenter is seen as part of a drive to attract younger women – but, like most traditional retailers, M\u0026ampS faces a fight.“Online retailers offer free returns so it’s easier to try stuff on at home than traipse around town.”At the moment, half of Britons are unable to have online orders delivered to their workplace and missed deliveries are eating into retailers already-squeezed profit margins. So a recent trial by Waitrose, in which drivers are allowed to enter customers’ homes to unpack their groceries while they are out, is seen as a sign of the final high street barricades falling.And that will mean many more empty shops on the high streets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a074f6bb16c17568b48127991f82e0a07d76b41e/0_574_4889_2935/master/4889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2d423ef4ad5d90ada4eabc90cd25df","title":"cold comfort in praise of the flu innoculation","story":"It’s that time of year again – the trip to the chemist, the little room, the little jab. Eva Wiseman reveals why avoiding actual flu is not the only reason she loves having the shotThe most magical time of the year – flu jab day, my chosen Christmas. I love it. I love the efficiency of popping into the chemist at lunchtime, as if for a meal deal or tampon, and leaving with the knowledge that I’m safe from four strains of flu, as well as a meal deal and a tampon. I love the wait on the hard chairs, the cheery conversation with a stranger whose neck has completely gone and who’s had it up to here with her boss. Last year I had a good chat with a man waiting for his methadone – he said it tasted horrid.I love to sit among those boxes of potential cures for whatever ails, whether head or feet or the hazy no-man’s land in between. I hear the lowered voices of people asking the chemist for bum cream, and prevent myself from shouting, in all my flu jab love: “We are all people my friend! Underneath our jacket, cardigan, T-shirt and pants, we are all people, and we all have a bum! Don’t be shy, you are home amongst your own kind.” At this time of year it is a constant struggle not to become one of the people that shouts affectionately at strangers.And then my name is called, and I love the intimacy of being in a room the size of a toilet with a pharmacist whose leaflet library is unsurpassed and whose breath tells an epic poem about the tuna sandwich she had at 12. I love the way the flu jab allows me to mutter: “I’m a brave little soldier” as I roll up my sleeve. I don’t hear that enough.I do not love the pain – and this year it hurt, less like the little prick intended and more like the mean bite of a small dog. But I do love the relief when I am pressing a ball of cotton wool to my arm and marvelling at the magic of vaccinations. I browse my complimentary literature, and learn that up to 17,000 people in the EU die annually from flu, but I needn’t be one of them.Last year’s flu was brutal, meaning the vaccine was less effective than hoped. But if more people get vaccinated, fewer people will get sick, so fewer viruses will be spread, and so on. And yet, the dangling threads of anti-vaxx anxiety tickle even the seemingly sane – research shows a longstanding scepticism about the flu vaccine, especially from young adults. People are worried about the side effects, claiming they’re worse than flu itself. These are people who, I’m confident in saying, have never had flu.I love the feeling of smugness when I emerge from the chemist into a bright afternoon with the knowledge that not only will nobody catch flu from me, but nobody will have to care for me either, or cover my work, or offer sympathy for my deathly condition and bad skin. Smiling at sour-faced office workers I’m a silent Oprah, flinging health to women in the cheap seats as if free handbags or flights to Antigua. “No flu for YOU, no flu for YOU!”And, leaning right back in my wheelie chair in the office, I love proselytising noisily as if a missionary returned from war, and weighed down with pamphlets and facts both reassuring (you can’t get the flu from a flu jab) and disgusting (the flu virus can survive on hard surfaces like door handles for a full day). My colleagues’ eyes glaze over as if I’m showing baby photos – people do not like being told what to do – but still, on I preach, because, it is becoming clear, I have been sent to Earth to irritate.I love the post-jab ache, as if my upper arm has taken itself off to pilates after a messy breakup, really working it, abs, a haircut, the whole “new me” rather than simply having been poked with a pin. It feels three times its size, like the bicep of a woman tanned and oiled and still lifting weights despite celebrating her 85th birthday with all her 18 photogenic grandchildren. Someone tapped my arm at Tesco and instinctively I yelled “BCG!”, the clarion call of nerds in playgrounds between the years 1989 and 1995. I love that the flu jab is also a time machine.And most of all, I love not getting flu. I love eating food that is not a single spoon of tinned soup, a centimetre of buttered toast, the painful slug of water that has been sitting in its glass for so long that a layer of flu dust has formed on its surface. I love the freedom of being able to fetch my own tea and daughter and put on my own tights. Walking without groaning is wildly underrated, as is getting through an entire day without complaining about one’s throat or feeling tired. I love not lying in damp sheets having dreams of death, awake all night with a single word tumbling over and over in my mind, its meaning long having been lost, now just a shape which will see me through to dawn, whereupon a dank sort of sleep will come, a drowning. All this casual, wonderful joy, from one sharp scratch. Waitrose has introduced salsify in 100 stores. What a glorious looking vegetable, hairy and muted, it looks like a feminist carrot.

A cluster of journalists gathered on the mezzanine while below them visitors filtered past signs for She Lase and Zero Gravity Skin and a stand for a company called Eurosilicone that claims to have been “Empowering women for over 30 years”. At the far end of the conference hall, a woman was having her jawline enhanced with fillers in front of a rapt crowd the Safety in Beauty stand was empty.Back on the mezzanine, there was a rustle of suits as the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) entered the room. Apologies for the delay, one said solemnly, there has been another death. A second British woman has died this year after a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL). Which made their announcement that they were henceforth warning surgeons not to perform the procedure particularly urgent. The brief was called “The Bottom Line”.Bottoms are big business in 2018. For a generation whose mothers spent mornings trying to shrink their thighs in front of Jane Fonda videos, today there is no such thing as a bum that’s too big. The perfect body has changed every decade over the past century, stretching and curving over time like a time-lapse sand dune.Body parts have come in and out of fashion depending on the mainstream obsessions of the moment, from the lean boyish chests of flappers in the 1920s, signifying liberation from corsetry, through 30s bosoms and 40s legs, to the sexualised femininity of Marilyn Monroe’s hourglass figure, and on eventually to 80s muscles (Power! Strength!), and 90s, well, bones. Extreme slenderness was maintained beyond the millennium, but with added breasts, a modified Monroe, minus the tummy.“Big bums are now associated with women with attitude and a sway who are non-white, which is desired,” says Susie Orbach, the psychotherapist who has been analysing women’s relationships to their bodies for more than 40 years.In 2012, I spoke to a group of 20-year-olds about the media pressure to change their bodies. Rather than extreme thinness, they said the pressure was to look sexy. “Everyone wants to look like Kim Kardashian, not Kate Moss. Curves, not bones.” Which sounded like a positive development, a move away from disordered eating and dangerous attempts at control, until they pointed out that it also requires a tiny waist. You can starve yourself bony, but “the sexy body is much more unattainable”.And then came the deaths, 33 of them in the US following complications from BBLs in the last five years.Instagram, that seductive hellmouth where women holiday in their lunchbreaks, contributes to the growth of bums in a number of ways. There are the celebrities, yes, sharing their “belfies”. There is the fetishisation of the bodies of black and Latina women. Kim Kardashian’s 2014 naked shoot by Jean-Paul Goude for Paper magazine, arguably the launchpad for the body trend that is today called “thicc”, was inspired by Goude’s (who is white) 1976 portrait of Carolina Beaumont, who is black the portrait was published in his book Jungle Fever.In 2014, American Vogue declared the big bum on trend... for white women: as soon as a trend goes mainstream, women of colour are eliminated from the story. “So common is the process, it has its own Twitter hashtag,” wrote Yomi Adegoke. “#Columbising – when, like Christopher Columbus, white people think they have discovered something that was already in existence.” There is that. There is also the rise of “body positivity”, of women sharing pictures of curves they’d been taught were shameful. And there is Instagram as a platform for cosmetic surgeons to advertise directly at women who, tipsy on the combination of insecurity and images of arses as empowerment, will click through to adjust their own.The latest post from Elite Aftercare, a clinic in Turkey (home of medical tourism) is a headless portrait of a happy customer, photographed from the front and from behind and tagged #BBL, #choices and #mybody. Scroll through to September, and there’s an update about a post-mortem on another of its patients, Leah Cambridge. She was a mother of three from Leeds, who, following this procedure, died on the operating table in August.At the Expo’s press briefing, the BAAPS doctors discussed a study analysing one London hospital where, since 2013, they’d seen a six-fold rise in cases needing urgent follow-up care from procedures done abroad. Complications from BBLs ranged from severe bacterial infections to tissue dying, scarring, wound ruptures and abscesses. One patient had a “flesh-eating” infection. BBLs have the highest death rate (conservatively, 1 in 3,000 operations) of all cosmetic surgery procedures, due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins that can travel to the heart or brain. In August, a celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon, Instagram name Dr Bumbum, was charged with murdering one of his patients. Dr Denis Furtado had performed an operation on Lilian Calixto to enlarge her buttocks in his own flat. He had nearly 650,000 followers.“A vulnerable group of patients are openly being targeted through social media,” said outgoing BAAPS president Simon Withey, “to travel abroad for cheaper cosmetic surgery – and this trend is likely to rise.” On Instagram, foreign clinics offer British customers “mummy makeovers”, and deals where the flight is free if you buy multiple operations – everywhere they promise that clients will feel “empowered”.Their glamorous imagery is in stark contrast to the photos accompanying an NHS report on the wall at the Expo, about the complications of cosmetic surgery abroad, one of which shows a buttock abscess being drained. “Hot!” choked a security guard, walking by.It’s not just cosmetic surgeons who claim they can empower women. For those who felt their bodies had been dismissed and sneered at for decades, but now find their arses the height of fashion, the big butt trend has been sold by the body positive movement as a step towards a more erse body acceptance. But… can body trends ever be a good thing? “The move towards bigger bums isn’t a good thing,” says Orbach, “It’s a thing. What may at first seem to mirror some women’s previously excluded experience simultaneously excludes other women, which would be OK if commerce weren’t riding on it and suggesting that big bums are the solution.”While fatalities are the most headline-grabbing result of Britain’s new pursuit of the bigger bottom, the implications of a changing obsession are less shocking, and more depressing. A realisation. Women will never be comfortable in their bodies, because the goal posts of what is acceptable keep shifting. We are encouraged to remain constantly at war with ourselves, shrinking, growing and utilising all the evolving technology that claims to alleviate the same anxiety that, simply by existing, it continues to feed us. And, to do so – to try and create your own Kardashian butt – is a rational reaction in 2018. The alternative is to be irrelevant, unbeautiful, and therefore, unseen.“Bodies and the surface are not our only calling card,” Orbach adds. “We are not brands, but people who can contribute and challenge and dare to live from our unique bodies, not facsimile ones.”Whew. All this from a bum. How did we get here? How did we get here from something that seemed so simple, so positive, so cheeky? A punchline, an inherently funny aspect of being human? An arse, we’re learning, is never just an arse. This is a trend we may need to sit on for a while.The costs, risks and significant rise of the Brazilian Butt Lift• A Brazilian Butt Lift, or BBL, is the colloquial term for buttock fat grafting, an elective cosmetic procedure which can cost up to £8,000 (in the UK) and involves removing fat from one part of the body via liposuction and transplanting it via injection into the buttocks, for a fuller effect.• The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said it was the most dangerous cosmetic procedure to undergo. Gerard Lambe, consultant plastic surgeon, explains: ‘It has the highest death rate of all procedures due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins in the buttocks, that can then travel to the heart or brain.’• About one in every 3,000 BBL patients worldwide has died of a pulmonary fat embolism. Twice as many developed chronic or serious complications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/461035612a44adb86d080e1a3d22a5b843eb06a6/970_13_3737_2243/master/3737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b745c6a6c2bc08e64509c9c9a44d31","title":"water bottle status symbol reusable fashion statement","story":"What does your water bottle say about you? An awful lot judging by the £5.5bn industry that has sprung up to convince us that a designer reusable bottle is a fashion statement and status symbol that comes with added environmental kudos.Arguably, it all began with celebrity endorsements: actress Julia Roberts photographed with a S’well bottle (£45) model Gisele Bündchen seen leaving a gym clutching a BKR (£30) actor Jonah Hill lugging a 64oz Hydroflask (£45).“The idea of reusable bottles being a fashion accessory is a good thing,” says Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, a Bristol-based nonprofit organisation that campaigns to prevent marine plastic pollution at source. “If you want people to adopt a new behaviour, if you want to create mass change, it helps to have influential people on board. Within the environmental movement, people have been carrying reusable bottles for years, but when you get Love Island contestants using them it is huge – it helps to normalise it.”Campaigners and water bottle brands cite the tipping point in the public’s awareness of plastic pollution as the BBC’s Blue Planet II series presented by Sir David Attenborough last year, which has led to the chancellor, in his autumn budget, consulting on the introduction of a new tax on plastic packaging.“It has been monumental in terms of discussion,” says James Butterfield, founder of Chilly’s, which sells £25 bottles popular for flamingo, avocado and floral prints. “We don’t go into a meeting where Blue Planet isn’t discussed – now, with the public turning against plastics, it has meant that when people look for a solution we are well positioned. The impact on our business has been huge.”Butterfield, who co-founded the company in 2010 and saw revenues of £2.5m in July last year, is forecasting a sharp rise to £40m in 2019. Chilly’s works with City to Sea on the Refill project, which aims to make free drinking water available on every high street in Britain and save a billion plastic bottles by 2025. With Refill, which was piloted in Bristol, City to Sea has now persuaded thousands of businesses – including John Lewis, Costa, Morrisons, Starbucks, Greggs and Wetherspoons – to allow people to refill their water bottles for free on their premises.“Airports have been less proactive but we haven’t met much resistance from chains,” says Fee. “It’s hard to know how much is a genuine desire to effect change and how much it’s about the public-shaming consequences if they don’t, but one of the advantages of working with them is that we have a seat at the table to discuss their wider plastic policy.”Louise Edge, a plastics campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “People are waking up to the fact that we are producing far more throwaway plastic waste than we can handle, and switching to reusable bottles, coffee cups and bags.”Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental group, estimates there are 150 million tonnes of plastic in the ocean Greenpeace aims to tackle this one bottle at a time. “This is more than a fashion,” says Edge. “It’s the start of a fundamental shift.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

Tonight’s event, curated by Trinidadian poet and novelist Anthony Joseph, is billed as “A Celebration” but it is an angrier and more militant show than that word implies.It starts with joy – a bubbly version of the Harry J Allstars’ old ska classic The Liquidator, then a star turn from the winding-and-grinding 78-year-old carnival queen Calypso Rose – but one gets the impression that Joseph isn’t a natural celebrator. Dressed in a sharp suit and a trilby (looking not unlike one of the Windrush emigres disembarking at Tilbury docks in June 1948, footage of which is projected above the band) Joseph is much better at righteous anger, a register that rather suits the mood. The music gets darker, and the songs are accompanied by a series of suitably militant quotes by Caribbean writers (Earl Lovelace, Pearl Connor-Mogotsi, Sam Selvon, Kamau Brathwaite, Frantz Fanon) and footage of political protest.Despite the attempts at a narrative thread, tonight’s gig often just works as a variety show, and there are plenty of great performances. The 10-piece band, led by Jason Yarde, are superb, blurring the boundaries between reggae, soca, Afrobeat and free jazz. Cellist, pianist and singer Ayanna Witter-Johnson brings the house down with her spartan reading of the Police’s Roxanne, accompanied only by the strums and slaps of her cello and the funereal harmonies of alto saxophonist Yarde, trumpeter Byron Wallen and trombonist Harry Brown. Brother Resistance’s Ring De Bell is a tremendous piece of politicised soca which the band transform into a Fela Kuti-like anthem, while south Londoner Gaika performs several pieces of gothic dancehall, putting his voice through an eerie harmoniser. Cleveland Watkiss adds a righteous reggae skank to Syl Johnson’s southern soul standard Is It Because I’m Black? and transforms Omar’s There’s Nothing Like This into a piece of lovers rock. Lord Kitchener’s Windrush anthem London Is The Place For Me is performed twice: first as a jaunty instrumental, then later as a quizzical, mournful version in a minor key, sung by Joseph’s teenage daughter Meena.Sometimes the overlap between militancy and entertainment is unintentionally hilarious: images of Black Lives Matter protests are still on screen as the ribald 83-year-old calypsonian Mighty Sparrow takes to the stage and sings his distinctly un-PC comedy song Congoman, about two white women who travel to Africa and get eaten by cannibals. At other times the boundaries become uncomfortable. Precious, a jerky piece of drum’n’bass scat-sung by Watkiss, is accompanied by photographs of 36 black Britons who have died in police custody since 1971. It is an intensely powerful montage but it nearly kills the evening stone dead. That is followed by the centrepiece of the show, a 25-minute instrumental song-cycle entitled The Windrush Suite, but by this point it’s nearly 11pm and hundreds of audience members are discreetly slipping out. When Joseph brings the suite to a close, it is greeted by a kind of stunned, shocked silence.Windrush: A Celebration was at least half an hour too long, and could have done with some more joy – it didn’t seem to locate anything to actually celebrate about the immigrant experience. But, as a way of marshalling seven decades of slow-burning rage into art, it was often devastatingly effective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a980d8e8fdfefb9b6f1ea304ba6496383f5b4c9/0_40_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4e639bc2ef91805b2dcdb99dfc811b","title":"the legacy of islamic state in iraq","story":"Two years on from the ‘liberation’ of Fallujah from Isis control, the ’s Peter Beaumont has returned to the Iraqi city.

It sports a large village green, a Farrow \u0026amp Ball paint shop and a Waitrose on its plush high street, and has more golf courses than you can shake a six-iron at.Once known as the stockbroker belt, this verdant corridor between the city suburbs and the M25 sometimes goes under the estate agent tag of superbia, suggesting a higher class of semi-detached lifestyle.It’s also, unsurprisingly, a Tory heartland, but after Theresa May’s proposed Brexit agreement, that heart appears in need of some urgent CPR. Esher’s MP is Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, who resigned following May’s announcement last week – his predecessor, David Davis, having resigned in July.To lose one Brexit secretary may be regarded as a misfortune, but as Lady Bracknell might have put it, to lose two looks like carelessness. “It’s a total mess,” says David Nutting, at the Moore Place golf club just outside the town. “We weren’t told the facts at the beginning, and we haven’t been told the facts all the way through. And now they’ve got themselves in a real state.”Nutting, who used to run his own plumbing business, plays golf with a group of his fellow retirees two or three times a week. They are evenly split between Remainers and Brexiters, which reflects Esher’s ided loyalties. The town forms part of Elmbridge, the Surrey borough that voted in the 2016 European Union referendum to remain. But Raab – who’s been mentioned as a possible leadership contender, should May lose a vote of confidence – is a staunch Brexiter.Yet for all their differing gripes, both sides at the golf club were agreed on one thing: the deal that Theresa May presented last week was not what they thought they were voting for, or against, in the referendum. If it was a choice between the current deal and staying in the EU, then Nutting, who voted to leave, would now opt for remaining.“I feel very uncomfortable,” says Charles Warren, who is also retired but used to work in insurance. “I don’t really know what their proposals are. It just seems to be a mess.” Given that the published draft withdrawal agreement runs to 585 pages, it can’t be said that May has neglected to explain her proposals. Nonetheless it’s what’s left out – the grey areas about what the Northern Ireland “backstop” measures will involve – that concerns the golfers. “We don’t know what they are,” says Cliff Taylor, a former jockey.Sandown Park racecourse sits on the edge of Esher, a huge expanse of parkland with towering stand that has seen some epic races down the years. But it’s a safe bet that no horse has ever been as much as a gamble as Brexit is turning out to be, particularly for May.When Raab retained his seat at the 2017 general election with a large but reduced 23,000 majority, he rejected the idea that there was growing resentment towards the Tories. As he put it at the time: “The truth is in modern politics you hear a lot from the fringes and what gets neglected is the silent mainstream majority.”No doubt he had his constituents in mind when he used that phrase. And at the golf club and elsewhere around town, a distinct gap does seem to be opening up between the grassroots and the leadership.Aware of the problem, May went over the heads of her MPs direct to Conservative association chairs last Friday afternoon, which may explain why Esher’s chairman, Tim Grey, wasn’t taking my calls.But if Raab and his fellow contenders hope that popular disappointment with May’s proposal will rebound on her, the message coming from Esher is far from encouraging. For all their frustration, few Tories at the golf club appear to want May to go. “There is no alternative,” says Warren.When I ask what the feeling is about Boris Johnson, the clubhouse explodes in a chorus of “Oh, come on!”Across town at the Wheatsheaf pub, the mixed message remains the same. “I’ve really lost faith in the Tory leadership,” says Sue Hill, a former detective chief superintendent with the Met. But she believed that May should stick to the job. “She has to get a backbone and get into some of these men and tell them who’s in charge. Be a bit more like Margaret. I’d be taking them one by one into a room.”Her friend Janice Runacres, a former forensics officer, thinks that May “needs to go”, but doesn’t believe that there’s a suitable candidate for her job. She and Hill think their local MP is too inexperienced. And again both dismiss Johnson out of hand.Jacob Rees-Mogg? “Lower than a snake’s belly,” says Hill.Both women voted to leave the EU, and neither is happy with the deal. Asked if she would have voted the same way, knowing what she knows now, Runacres says: “I’m not sure that I would.”Hill doesn’t believe the electorate really knew what it was voting for in the referendum. “We all voted on a whim,” she says.In her own case she says it was for personal reasons to do with border security. “There was a little girl I dealt with that was murdered by a Latvian guy that was over here and nobody knew he was here. Our borders aren’t safe. But had I known the impact that it was going to have on me, my kids, property prices – looking back, the government didn’t give us enough information.”In reality, there was a great deal of information. It was just that a lot of it was false or hard to understand. What’s striking is that both women say they were misinformed, both feel worried about the impact of Brexit, and yet both want to get out of the EU “as soon as possible”. And neither wants a second referendum.“This country has voted,” says Hill definitively, although she says it didn’t know what it was voting for. “You’ll destroy all faith in voting in the future. We have to go through with it, whether we made the right decision or not.” Just as oddly, given her concern about the economic implications of Brexit, she’d prefer a no-deal option to what’s on the table.After talking at length to Raab’s “neglected silent mainstream majority”, I began to appreciate why they might be neglected. What is most notable are the glaring contradictions: May is not up to the job, but she should stick it out. Brexit has been a disaster – and we should get out of Europe as soon as possible. And my personal favourite, that being in the EU has meant, as Hill claims, that the younger generation, including her children, can’t get on the property ladder, followed by the complaint that “property is dropping like a stone round here”.The cognitive dissonance seems endemic. However, in politics the voters are always right. And while the criticism and analysis heard in Esher may lack a certain intellectual coherence, there is an emotional discontent that is undoubtedly authentic.Hill describes herself as a Conservative through and through. But, she says: “I’m beginning to think that our politics are trash, we’ve got no leadership and they’re all backstabbers with no integrity.”That’s something an enemy might say. When it’s coming from a diehard supporter in the sleepy comforts of superbia, the Tories should know they are in trouble."},{"url":null,"title":"dadaist pm and vague corbyn make nonsense of current state of brexit","story":"Both party leaders depart Sky’s Ridge on Sunday politics show with credibility further diminishedThe drugs still aren’t working. Or if they are, then Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been given the wrong prescriptions. Both party leaders appeared on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday politics show to make sense of the current state of the Brexit negotiations, and both departed with their credibility further diminished. Far from each having a vision for the future, they looked as if they would be lucky to find a way out of the building. Even with the exit signs clearly marked.After an interview in Saturday’s Daily Mail in which the prime minister tried to emphasise her human qualities – she might even have opened a can of baked beans last week! Who knew? – she was now back to her familiar stubborn, automaton self. No one was going to take her alive. If her own party wanted to come for her then let them bring it on. This was a fight to the death.May began by arguing that her Brexit deal wasn’t about her – a message that doesn’t appear to have got through to her cabinet, her MPs or the rest of the country. It was about the national interest. It was about getting a deal that was worse than what we already had and nothing like the one that had originally been promised. A deal against which everyone could unite. Ridge looked understandably confused but tried to pin her down.Maybe they could start with something easy. What bit of the deal did she actually believe in? None of it, May replied confidently. Because it was in the national interest for her not to believe in it. Obviously the 570 pages of the withdrawal agreement weren’t that great for the UK, but people shouldn’t get too fixated on the details of the backstop agreements, because there was a vanishingly small possibility that they would never be put in place. Ridge sighed. Mainly with pleasure. This was TV gold. Getting the prime minister to say something stupid live on air is every interviewer’s dream.Chancing her arm, Ridge suggested there was a problem with the UK not being able to end the backstop unilaterally. May happily obliged with more spontaneous dadaism. It was like this. The backstop was like an insurance policy and no policy could be ended unilaterally. Here we had a prime minister all but admitting she needed permission to cancel her house insurance. And yes, she was furious at having to continue paying for policies she no longer needed. Like the home contents insurance at No 10.In any case, people shouldn’t get too fixated about the withdrawal agreement as that was all signed off – something she had either omitted to tell Andrea Leadsom or that Leadsom was too stupid to have grasped – and concentrate on the future trade agreement. All seven pages of it. In the next week – she couldn’t say exactly when as she hadn’t checked availability on Eurostar – she was going back to Brussels in the hope of fleshing out the future trade agreement to another couple of pages of waffle. Nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. Ridge begged to differ. Everyone agreed she had won the interview hands down.As she had with Corbyn earlier in the programme. The Labour leader didn’t get off to the best of starts, admitting he hadn’t read the entire withdrawal agreement. Obviously almost no one else in parliament has done so either – and those that have, apart from a few lawyers who make a living from disagreeing on its meaning, have failed to understand its full meaning – but it wasn’t a great look for someone who wants to be prime minister.Corbyn did manage to clarify how Labour couldn’t stop Brexit on its own, but was at a loss when asked to square how Labour could negotiate a deal as good as the one the UK already had with the EU when the EU had categorically stated it was a non-starter.But it was on the second referendum that he really struggled. It wasn’t something for now, but for the future. Except with just 131 days till 29 March, the future is pretty much now and Corbyn appeared to have no views on what choices should be on a second referendum or how he would vote if there was one. Rather he was going to pin all his hopes on voting down May’s deal and a no deal and cross his fingers that the government would call a general election even though it definitely wouldn’t. Shares in Ridge soared, just as shares in the UK plunged.Still, May and Corbyn were visions of clarity compared with Dominic Raab over on the Andrew Marr Show. The former Brexit secretary imagines himself to be a natural leader, a Marvel superhero. The rest of the world sees him as Captain Mainwaring in Lycra. A genuinely comic comic-book hero.He had resigned as Brexit secretary because his support for the prime minister was so firm and unwavering that it was better expressed from the backbenches. The withdrawal agreement he had helped to negotiate was nothing like the deal he had helped to negotiate. People dying as a result of a no-deal Brexit was no biggie because they could have been run over and killed on a B road. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Bizarrely, a few people other than Raab appear to believe he could be that man. Time for the hard hats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc2f841860aab0d4de3457f9cd9f24ebf66a33e/944_607_2206_1324/master/2206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2277cbbd8a2ee3ee7e71e10182150e5f","title":"jeremy corbyn second referendum not an option for today","story":"Labour leader says he does not know how he would vote if another vote was calledJeremy Corbyn has declined to support calls for a second referendum, insisting that it is an option that can only be considered in the long term.The Labour leader also said that if there was another referendum, he did not know how he would vote.His comments will offer little comfort to growing numbers of Labour MPs who are calling for a so-called people’s vote.His comments came after a week in which Theresa May’s administration has teetered on the verge of collapse following the release of the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Pressed on how he would vote by Sky News interviewer Sophy Ridge, Corbyn said he voted to remain at the 2016 referendum and that there were “reforms needed” in the EU.“I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time,” he said.Corbyn said: “It’s an option for the future, but it’s not an option for today. If there was a referendum tomorrow, what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be?”Corbyn, a longstanding critic of the EU, was asked whether Labour was offering enough leadership over Brexit and whether it could play a bigger role in coordinating those opposed to the government’s withdrawal agreement.He replied: “We couldn’t stop it because we don’t have the votes in parliament to do so.“There was a referendum in 2016, a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.”He criticised May’s draft withdrawal agreement for allowing the EU to call “all the shots”.“We’ll vote against this deal because it doesn’t meet our tests,” he said. “We don’t believe it serves the interest of this country, therefore the government have to go back to the EU and renegotiate rapidly.“There’s 500 pages in this document much of which is quite vague. Where’s the guarantee on environmental protections? Where’s the guarantee on consumer protections? Where’s the guarantee on workers’ rights?”Corbyn said Labour would focus on negotiating a permanent customs arrangement with the EU, as if this was not agreed the UK would “lose on jobs, lose on investment and we lose on future economic development”.His remarks follow comments made last week in an interview with Der Spiegel that “we can’t stop it” – in reference to the UK’s departure from the EU.“The referendum took place,” he said. “Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognise the reasons why people voted leave.”It led to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, attempting to clarify confusion over the party’s policy, claiming: “Brexit can be stopped.”In his interview with Ridge, Corbyn said: “As of this moment, the arithmetic in parliament is such that Brexit has been triggered, article 50. We voted for article 50 in order to give respect to the referendum.“I was asked this question by Der Spiegel and what I said was we couldn’t stop it because we don’t have the votes in parliament to do so.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she would seek discussions with other parties, including with Corbyn, when she visits London later this week.Ignoring warnings made by Theresa May’s deputy, David Lidington, that she should support the deal because there were no further options for renegotiation, Sturgeon told Marr: “If the Commons says ‘we want to go down the road of single marketcustoms union, we want to take this back to the people of the UK in another vote, we need an extension of Article 50’, if there is a clear change of direction, then I believe the EU27 would be prepared to look at that.“Those who don’t think the prime minister’s deal is the right way to go have now a responsibility to come together and coalesce around an alternative.”On Sunday, two opinion polls showed support for the Conservatives had been dented, with May’s party now trailing Labour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/23/1290506292406/Lisa-OCarroll-byline-004.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=147307a6e35e0b2951dfc499d8a182bf\" alt=\"Lisa O\u0026#x27;Carroll","title":"theresa may brexit jeremy corbyn eu live","story":"PM says she will meet Juncker to discuss future relationships, and to her knowledge 48-letter threshold for no-confidence vote not yet reachedNo, don’t laugh, even if Steve Hilton who puts forward this opinion in the Sunday Times – with the headline “Only David Cameron can save us. Yes, you read that right” – is almost expecting it. Cameron’s former director of strategy at No 10 writes: Who can make all this happen? Clearly not Theresa May. Equally, a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn would be a calamity, sending investors and businesses hurtling for the exits. So what are we left with?What Britain needs above all is a leader with the confidence and the character to command respect and bring people together from all sides of this bruising two-year national meltdown.If there is a Conservative party leadership election, no doubt many able MPs will throw their hat in the ring. But there’s one name that should also be on the list: David Cameron.The former prime minister reportedly remarked in the early hours of June 24, after the Brexit vote had gone against him, “Why should I do all the hard shit?”I think we know the answer to that question now. And, considering where we are now, David Cameron’s return to No 10 could in fact be the best hope for Britain.The piece has, at least, garnered some amusing responses:And this meme, because you simply can’t see it too many times:Sky News’ deputy political editor, Beth Rigby, has tweeted that the Tory whips are currently shoring up support for this week’s finance bill, over fears that some might abstain because of anger in the party. Some pro-Brexit Tory MPs are suggesting the government faces a rocky ride this week as the finance bill comes back to the House of Commons. They believe the DUP may be prepared to sit on its hands and allow Theresa May to be defeated, which would raise the question of whether the confidence and supply agreement – on which her majority rests – remains operative.However, Labour sources point out it is hard to identify an amendment to the bill which the DUP would be likely to support. The one currently deemed most likely to create problems for the government is backed by remainers Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry, and calls for MPs to be given a full economic analysis of remaining in the EU, alongside projections for May’s deal and no deal which the government has promised to provide to parliament before the meaningful vote next month.The organisation representing ship owners in the UK says its time for Brexiters to “put up or shut up”, accept Theresa May’s deal or come up with a fully-baked alternative. “International agreements rarely please everyone, and I accept this deal gives neither leave nor remain campaigners everything that they want, but we have now run out of time. “This deal has been struck after years of complex, detailed and technical negotiations. We respect those who cannot support the proposed deal, but their dissent requires them to put forward a clear, unambiguous and workable alternative immediately. In short it’s time to put up or shut up,” says UK Chamber of Shipping’s chief executive, Bob Sanguinetti.Sanguinetti also acknowledged that many people are tired of hearing no deal warnings, but argued that the uncertainty of no deal was too big a risk to take.“I know people are tired of business groups warning of a No Deal scenario. There is however a direct relationship between political decisions and people’s day to day lives and it is our duty to alert them to the facts.“It may be the case that over the medium term markets will shift and adapt well to a No Deal economy, but nobody truly understands the damage that will be done in the meantime. “In a no deal scenario, it is a fact that there will be long delays in ports putting manufacturing supply chains and just-in-time deliveries of pharmaceuticals and fresh food at risk. It is a fact that costs would go up for consumers. It is a fact that this will damage both the UK and the EU. The question is how long it would take to sort all that out – and for that there is no clear answer. “Those hoping for a no-deal Brexit, or prepared to risk one, have a duty to explain in technical detail why this is a risk worth taking.”The DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson says reports over the weekend that the party is under fire from business and farming interests in its home turf do not mean unionist support for Brexit is waivering.Around a dozen groups in Northern Ireland including retailers, the Ulster Farmers’ Union and the Confederation of British Industry Northern Ireland have said no deal would be devastating for the region, putting it at odds with the DUP. DUP Jeffrey Donaldson tweeted a while ago that the idea the party was at war with local interests was “nonsense”. “The idea that it’s the DUP v everyone else is nonsense. There isn’t a single unionist party in Northern Ireland that so far supports this Brexit deal. I have received messages of support from businesspeople and farmers in my constituency who endorse our stance #noborderinirishsea,” he tweeted. “That doesn’t mean that all businesspeople and farmers support the deal. We have many telling us they don’t. We don’t claim to speak for everyone and business groups shouldn’t either,” he added. Speaking on LBC, the former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell says May’s proposed withdrawal agreement is only “marginally better” than leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Corbyn critics have also pounced on the fact that this morning he admitted on Sophie Ridge on Sky he hadn’t read every line of the 583-page draft Brexit agreement.(He did of course say he’d read most of it, and summaries etc.)For those of us in the same boat as the leader of the opposition, our Jessica Elgot has a very useful thread on Twitter about what to read to get a better understanding:Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has been laying into Jeremy Corbyn since his interview with Sophy Ridge this morning, saying that he will go down in history as “may’s little helper”. HuffoPo have pointed out how heated the conversation between Marr and Chakrabarti got this morning. He’s a excerpt of the section where Marr told Chakrabarti not to “patronise” him. MARR: “I don’t understand why you want to leave the EU.” Chakrabarti: “I don’t want to leave the EU, I campaigned to Remain. I’m a democrat.”MARR: “But you’re going to go through a General Election campaign as a member of a party whose manifesto says ‘we are leaving the EU’.”Chakrabarti: “I’m a democrat, I don’t know about you Andrew, but I’m a democrat.”MARR: “Don’t try and patronise me, I’m as much a democrat as you are.”Chakrabarti: “I certainly wouldn’t try to patronise you and I’m sure you would never try to patronise me.”Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs - and the man who is the recipient of those letters of no confidence in Theresa May - has been speaking to John Pienaar (and our own Jess Elgot) on BBC 5Live.He said there’s so much speculation about how many he’s received that he’s even been asked about it while he’s trying to do the shopping. “I get asked it in the supermarket, I get asked it in the street,” he said. “I’ve become very nervous about counting, or saying numbers, in case people think I’m saying something that I’m not.” Brady said that he hasn’t even told his wife how may letters he had received. Not surprisingly, he wouldn’t say whether he’s anywhere near that all-important target of 48 - but he did insist that if it happens, the Conservative party rules suggest a no confidence vote would be quick. “The whole thing is written with the intention that it should be an expeditious process,” he said, adding, “it ought to be a test of opinion very quickly, in order to clear the air and get it resolved”.Asked about his own views - and whether he would be submitting a letter to himself(!) he said it wasn’t a sensible time to challenge the prime minister. “We are coming to the endgame of a very serious, very difficult negotiation, and for the government to be plunged into uncertainty would have implications for that”.But as a Brexiter, he suggested the deal as currently drafted looks highly unlikely to secure a majority in the House of Commons, and he hopes the final political declaration about Britain’s future trading relationship - to be hammered out over the next few days, “gives considerably stronger grounds for optimism about the final nature of the deal”.He reiterated the point on Sunday Politics NW. Speaking to Andrew Marr, first minister Nicola Sturgeon remained oblique about the prospects of a second independence referendum, using the same form of words about “waiting for the dust to settle” that she did in Holyrood when pressed last week.It’s well worth comparing what Sturgeon said on Marr with the remarks she made in the far less formal setting of the Women for Independence conference in Perth yesterday. WfI was one of the most prominent, non-aligned groups of the 2014 campaign which has since successfully reinvented itself as a broader campaign group. Significantly, this is the first time that Sturgeon has spoken at one of their events – of course the conference was organised long before last week’s crisis, but her appearance there is interesting nonetheless.She urged WfI activists – who are already on the cannier end of the yes spectrum – that “there is no route to independence that is not through a democratic decision of the majority of the Scottish people no matter how much we want there to be”, joking that it dissolving the union was easy she’d have done it by now.She told delegates that she had some sympathy for Theresa May, surrounded by shouty men and left to clean up after David Cameron, but added that the past week “strengthened the case for independence immeasurably”.Of course this isn’t the first time that Sturgeon has suggested a form of progressive alliance headed by the SNP at Westminster, and that didn’t work out so well for Ed Miliband in the 2015 general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdc1f0c89a933c83f71d67cfd2c2f95578fb92ef/0_2074_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8073b9ffdcd48384f52b3556a145343","title":"philisophically speak we can never fully trust our memory ylva hilde ostby adventure in memory","story":"Sisters Hilde and Ylva Østby, a neuropsychologist and a novelist, have written a book exploring the true nature of memory. What can their findings tell us?Of all the mysteries of the mind, perhaps none is greater than memory. Why do we remember some things and forget others? What is memory’s relationship to consciousness and our identities? Where and how is memory stored? How reliable are our memories? And why did our memory evolve to be so rich and detailed?In a sense there are two ways of looking at memory: the literary and the scientific. There is the Proustian model in which memory is about meaning, an exploration of the self, a subjective journey into the past. And then there is the analytical model, where memory is subjected to neurological study, psychological experiments and magnetic resonance imaging.A new book – or rather a recent translation of a two-year-old book – by a pair of Norwegian sisters seeks to marry the two approaches. The co-authors of Adventures in Memory: The Science and Secrets of Remembering and Forgetting are Ylva Østby, a clinical neuropsychologist, and Hilda Østby, an editor and novelist.Their book begins in 1564, with Julius Caesar Arantius performing a dissection of a human brain. Cutting deep into the temporal lobe, where it meets the brain stem, he encounters a small, wormlike ridge of tissue that resembles a sea horse. He calls it hippocampus – or “horse sea monster” in Latin. The significance of this discovery would take almost 400 years to come to light.As with so much to do with our understanding of the brain, the breakthrough came through a malfunction. An American named Henry Molaison suffered from acute epilepsy, and in 1953 he underwent an operation in which the hippocampi from both sides of his brain were removed. The surgery succeeded in controlling his epilepsy but at the cost of putting an end to his memory.For the remaining 55 years of his life, he was unable to form new memories – or rather, new explicit memories. Memory is ided up in various ways. First between long-term and short-term memory. Explicit memory, which is part of long-term memory, is the product of conscious thought, while implicit memory enables unthinking rote actions. Explicit memory is itself subided between episodic memory – the autobiographical record of our experience – and semantic memory, which concerns general knowledge or “textbook learning”.Molaison’s short-term (sometimes called working) memory remained intact, as did his procedural (or implicit) memory. He could learn new motor skills. He just couldn’t remember learning them. Molaison’s case had a profound effect on the study of memory, chiefly in placing the hippocampus as a vital part of memory formation and retention.As the Østby sisters acknowledge, memory is an area of neuropsychology that is fraught with dispute. While everyone agrees that the role of the hippocampus is central to memory, there is ision over whether it is simply the part of the brain that consolidates memory or if is also employed to overwrite the original memory with each new recollection of it.In fact, almost everything about memory remains open to debate, speculation, theorising. It used to be thought, for example, that memories were like files that we retrieved or – if we couldn’t recall them – lost. Now it’s much more widely understood that memories are created and then recreated, each time in a slightly different way.When I meet the Østby sisters in a central London hotel, I tell them that this is a disturbing insight because it suggests that our memories are inherently unreliable. If they are subject to continual change they cannot represent reality with any degree of accuracy. What’s more, as we don’t realise that a memory has changed, because it always feels “real” to us, it means it’s a kind of illusion. So does this mean we shouldn’t trust our memories?“It’s a very difficult question,” says Ylva, who is the younger sister by four years. “To some extent we can rely on our memory, but not on every little minute detail. In the court of law you have to decide where the tipping point is. But philosophically speaking, we can say we can never fully trust our memory.”The strange thing is, some people do recall things in extraordinary detail, while others – the depressed, for example – find it hard to bring to mind more than the basic raw facts of a memory. But this does not necessarily mean that one memory is more reliable than the others. As Hilde explains, it’s a bit like writing autobiographical fiction. The writer takes the basic facts and then fills in the gaps with their imagination. That’s what we do with memory as well. It’s a creative act as much as it is an accurate representation of the past.Exactly how a memory is created and then becomes something we can recollect at a later time is not fully known. But current thinking ides the process into three stages: encoding (the formation of a new memory), consolidation (its transformation into a long-term memory) and recollection (the retrieval of contextual information about a given event).Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans can show us the different locations of activity in the brain while we remember an incident, but they don’t tell us exactly how the memory is formed, retained or retrieved.“It’s impossible to capture the whole essence of memory in one fMRI experiment,” says Ylva.But she says her colleagues in Oslo have conducted an fMRI experiment in which participants are shown pictures in various contexts and 40 minutes later are rescanned while they recall whatever they can about the images.“There is a strong suggestion,” says Ylva, “that the hippocampus is more active during the encoding of these long-term memories. So fMRI has its uses but they come with many caveats.”Memory, as an observable process, remains shrouded in myth. One of the most insistent myths stems from Freud’s early understanding of repressed memories. The basic idea is that children unconsciously bury traumatic memories that can sometimes later be retrieved under hypnosis or psychoanalysis. Although there is some evidence to support a limited conception of repressed, or more accurately dissociated memory, it’s a field of research that has suffered from claims of false memory manipulation. In the 1990s, the satanic child sex abuse cases that sprang up, and built on recovered memories, were proven to be erroneous.“Most traumatic memories are highly memorable,” says Ylva. “It’s much more common that bad memories haunt people.”In the book, the sisters accompany Adrian Pracon, who was the last person to be shot by Anders Behring Breivik during the terror attack of 2011 on Utøya, which left 69 of Pracon’s fellow summer campers dead. Pracon has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since the slaughter. His memories, he says, are still affected by the fact that his initial response to Breivik’s shooting spree was that it wasn’t real.So he had to first take in that what he saw as an act – an illusion – was actually lethal reality. And then afterwards he had to work to accept that his fears, dreams and even visions were not real but hallucinations.That’s a heavy toll to place on the human mind. Interestingly, research done at the University of Oxford suggests that PTSD can be relieved by playing a computer game in the immediate hours following a traumatic event. The theory is that the game weakens the strong visual memories associated with the original trauma by offering competing images.It’s unlikely that someone who had been through the horror that Pracon experienced would then pull out a smartphone and start playing with it – even if he had not been wounded. In his own case, Pracon chose to face his fears by returning to the scene of the trauma.“He wanted to go,” says Hilde. “He’s been several times. He’s still fighting his memories but now he’s studying in Oxford and he wants to be a researcher in terrorism and peace work.”“The important message is that trauma can last a lifetime,” says Ylva. “People around you have to realise that it’s not simply going to go away.”Indeed, what’s striking about memory is that the things we want to remember are often difficult to recall, while the things we’d prefer not to remember are impossible to forget. We don’t seem, in other words, to have much control over our episodic memories. Most of us will recall the emotionally charged events of our lives – the first kiss, a near-death experience. But it’s only really semantic memory that we can reliably hold on to by actively memorising.In terms of semantic memory, Hilde says that when she was a student there was no internet or social media and she was able to concentrate for long periods on what she had to read.“I don’t think students have that kind of concentration today,” she says, “and that will effect what they get into their long-term memory and what they remember.”Ylva also worries that the constant distraction of social media will undermine the flow of our episodic memories and our ability to let our mind wander in creative, unpredictable ways. This kind of flow, or stream of recollection, brings us back to the Proustian richness of memory, in which a tea cake can summon up a whole world lost to the passage of time.Although it’s obvious why a squirrel would need to remember where it has hidden its nuts, or why a wildebeest might want to recall the places where lions like to gather, it’s not so clear why evolution has left us with this cinematic or novelistic memory of times past. The theory that has recently gained most ground is that memory supplies evolutionary advantage less because of its focus on the past than as a means of preparing for the future.“It makes sense to see memory as the other side of the future,” says Ylva, “because it allows you to imagine scenarios. Not just knowing what is likely and what is not likely, but you can feel it and think what that scenario makes you feel. Would you act on it if that’s how it makes you feel? It’s a kind of fantastic time machine.”Perhaps that in the end is what sets humans apart – our ability to place ourselves in the future, to anticipate and appreciate what a situation or set of circumstances might entail. And the great temporal irony is that we’ve attained this facility through being able to recall with such haunting vividness what took place in the past.All these centuries on, we can see that the sea horse that Arantius found lurking in the depths of the brain wasn’t just a memory bank but an investment bank, storing up information and emotional understanding for tomorrow and, unless a nuclear arms race intervenes, lifetimes to come.• Adventures in Memory: The Science and Secrets of Remembering and Forgetting by Hilde Østby and Ylva Østby is published by Greystone Books (£16.99).

Eighteen months into the pilot, it appears to be lifting a load from doctors who have said that until recently every third appointment they handled involved an issue they were not qualified to help with, including accessing welfare or tackling loneliness and housing problems.Simon Stevens, the NHS England’s chief executive, has visited the project and its progress is informing a wider roll-out of social prescribing in the health service. An NHS team is assessing the cost and impact.Dr Agnelo Fernandes, who leads Parchmore, said it had resulted in a marked reduction in the number of people using doctors’ appointments for non-medical issues. It’s also hoped that by easing the workload, GP jobs in deprived areas will become more desirable.The list of activities which can be prescribed in Croydon now runs to 112. One of the newest is being set up by the landlady of the Prince George pub in Thornton Heath, Sheila Gaughan. She is offering a free coffee morning to combat loneliness and a drop-in for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their carers.“It’s dead time in the pub and we can put it to better use,” she said.Other sessions include gardening, mindfulness and a choir, with practices texting suggestions to people with different vulnerabilities about sessions they could join. An app for patients is being developed with the help of Apple, said Brian Dickens, the practice manager at Parchmore who has driven the plan.“It is rediscovering social value,” said Steve Reed, the Labour MP for Croydon North. “Communities want to reach out and support each other.”During a packed over-50s fitness class in St Paul’s Church, people who had been prescribed the session included Patrick Fallon, 65, who was keeping fit after treatment for cancer, Jenny Hall, 72, who was missing her husband after he died and Mary Tagoe, 69, who had suffered lower back pain.“It has helped,” Mary said. “It has made me more mobile and has improved my general health. Another aspect is I am meeting other people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b82a6d9e277f011b5657795ca9a3b0dedccc36/28_26_2873_1724/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=022daba27ebacd29a4640dab9434a50d","title":"joe root hails very special test series win over sri lanka after sleepless night","story":"Like most modern Test captains Joe Root has had to learn how to lead on the job. Now after 23 games in charge the feeling grows he has the measure of one of the most demanding posts in British sport. He is more comfortable as captain. This impression is enhanced by his acknowledgment he makes mistakes out there. Insecure captains do not usually admit that.After England’s 57-run victory in Pallekele Root reflected on Sri Lanka’s run-chase, which at various points on Saturday looked as if it might be successful. “Those two extended periods in the first two sessions really hurt us. I didn’t manage those as well as I could as captain, having not had that experience before. It’s a good learner for me”.Root frets like the rest of us. He admitted he barely slept on Saturday night with England needing three wickets for a rare series victory overseas. “I had about three hours, I reckon. I was thinking about all the different scenarios that could happen but as soon as I got to the dressing room I felt very calm. Knowing the ability within the dressing room, the number of different options we can turn to, we were always going to be able to create enough chances to win. Then it was just about being cool enough to take them. We certainly did that”.Root described the series victory as “very special”. “I think we have probably played better than anticipated,” he said. “We have read the situations in the games very well given we don’t have much experience here. Jimmy Anderson is the only one in these two games who has played here before in Test cricket. The way we have handled all that is fantastic.“The guys have worked extremely hard. We’ve planned very well. We said we were going to play in a certain manner and we’ve backed that up in the two games. That’s probably the most pleasing thing. We’ve stuck to our guns. We’ve been ruthless when we’ve had opportunities to get ahead in the game and we’ve soaked up pressure well on occasions.”“We’re learning from the one-day side as well. Eoin Morgan said to the guys ‘go and play with freedom’ and you saw when the guys really took to that, harnessed it, embraced it, there was a big improvement very quickly. It’s not as straightforward as that in Test cricket. You can’t say ‘swing as hard as you can’ but at times being able to take pressure off and having a clear understanding of how you want to play can really help.”The team appear to be heading in the right direction and so does the captain. In those 23 Tests in charge Root has 12 wins and nine losses. With one Test against Sri Lanka to come this week in Colombo, three in West Indies early next year and another against Ireland at Lord’s that record should be looking even healthier come the Ashes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ee9727be2ef3d49a98dab5eb90b96cc1b134225/308_166_4350_2611/master/4350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b605d5592481a355f6e884e383451e8f","title":"steve hansen ireland joe schmidt all blacks new zealand rugby union","story":"Steve Hansen will reveal a decision on his future before Christmas that could yet see Joe Schmidt join New Zealand’s coaching ranks after the 2019 World Cup.The All Blacks coach said he already knows his plans and will make them public before the turn of the year.Schmidt is out of contract with Ireland after next year’s World Cup, whereupon he could yet return to his native New Zealand. He is a strong favourite to join the All Blacks whenever he makes that move.Schmidt masterminded Ireland’s 16-9 win over New Zealand in Dublin on Saturday, to back up the 40-29 triumph in Chicago in 2016.New Zealand have no shortage of quality coaching options should Hansen decide to step down after the next World Cup. Hansen was assistant to Graham Henry when New Zealand won the World Cup on home soil in 2011 and guided the All Blacks to retain the Webb Ellis Trophy in England in 2015 as coach.The 59-year-old former policeman could of course opt to continue at the All Blacks helm but should he step aside then his assistant Ian Foster could take on the top job. New Zealand have a policy of promoting coaches into the All Blacks ranks from Super Rugby coaching jobs but the former captain Richie McCaw has already insisted they could break that to draw Schmidt straight into their Test setup.Jacob Stockdale’s 12th try in 14 Tests sealed Ireland’s stunning win over New Zealand, with Schmidt’s men claiming just their second victory over the back-to-back world champions.New Zealand held on to their official world No 1 ranking, despite losing to second placed Ireland, as the hosts pulled off a defensive masterclass to shut out the visitors.Hansen insisted before the Test that the winners would earn the right to call themselves the best in the world, regardless of the rankings and challenged Ireland to live up to that tag.Asked how Ireland have improved under Schmidt, Hansen said: “I think they are fitter their defence is great. Both teams defended for long periods and defended really well, and their scrum was good.

Nathan Lane, Cybill Shepherd and others reveal what makes her tickThe very idea ought to be mind-boggling. Elaine May, now 86, is currently starring as a woman in the grip of Alzheimer’s in The Waverly Gallery, the Pulitzer-nominated play by Kenneth Lonergan. But the mere thought of her being on a Broadway stage virtually every day for the next few months will astonish anyone acquainted with the extraordinary life and career of this reclusive actor, writer and director.May’s improvisational sketches with the late Mike Nichols made stars of them both in the 1950s and 1960s, revealing them to be the architects of a biting, sophisticated new species of comedy. Edmund Wilson called May “something of a genius”. Robert Towne, screenwriter of Chinatown, said: “She’s always been ahead of the rest of us. You could even say that there are times when the zeitgeist follows her.” And Richard Burton wrote in his diary: “Elaine was too formidable … one of the most intelligent, beautiful and witty women I had ever met. I hoped I would never see her again.”Her aversion to the limelight has been lifelong. She has directed four sharp-clawed films – A New Leaf, The Heartbreak Kid, Mikey and Nicky, and the unfairly maligned Ishtar – and battled vehemently with Hollywood studios for control on most of them. Though she has occasionally taken screenplay credits (including Warren Beatty’s Heaven Can Wait and Nichols’s Primary Colors, both of which brought her Oscar nominations), her film work is more often carried out in the shadows. She was once the industry’s most sought-after script doctor, secretly helping to ensure such movies as Tootsie, Reds and Labyrinth were in the rudest of health.She has rarely given interviews. “I’d appreciate it,” she once told a reporter who was writing about her, “if you didn’t mention my name in your article.” She sent up her own guardedness in a trailer for the 1990 comedy In the Spirit, in which she said: “I was in the movie and I’m willing to talk about it, but I don’t want to be identified.” As far back as her Nichols and May days, she was keeping a low profile. The sleevenotes on the duo’s album Improvisations to Music contained the message: “Miss May does not exist.”Broadway audiences can attest otherwise. On the very stage at the John Golden theatre where she and Nichols performed their 10-month, sell-out run of An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May in the early 1960s, she is now giving a devastating study in disintegration. She plays Gladys, an elderly Greenwich Village gallery owner who is succumbing to Alzheimer’s as her family (including Lucas Hedges as her grandson and Joan Allen as her daughter) looks on helplessly and sometimes impatiently.The concentrated energy within her tiny, bird-like body is palpable, her line readings so deceptively light and throwaway that it can take a moment to realise she has just said something funny, stinging or sad. That delayed effect is part of her style: “The nice thing is to make an audience laugh and laugh and laugh and shudder later,” she once said.“It’s extraordinary to see Elaine back on the stage where she performed with Mike,” says the actor Nathan Lane, who worked with May on Nichols’s 1996 comedy The Birdcage. “And for someone her age to take on a huge role like this demands a lot of stamina. I would think it’s also a particularly difficult role to learn because of all the hesitations. It’s a real challenge but I thought she was very funny and very moving.”Lane still remembers his first meeting with May. “I told her, ‘It’s a great honour to meet you.’ I was holding the script and she pointed to it and said in this desperate, faux-exasperated sort of way: ‘I did the best I could.’ She’s one of the brightest, wittiest people I’ve ever encountered. The records she made with Mike were groundbreaking, so fresh and original.”When May met Nichols in Chicago in the mid-1950s, she was a orced Method acting student with a young daughter (the actor Jeannie Berlin, born when May was 18). Their first significant encounter was on a crowded bench, where Nichols pretended to be a spy. “May I seet down?” he asked, to which May replied: “If you veesh.” Without forethought or fanfare, their career in improvisation was under way. They joined the Compass Players, Chicago’s influential improv group, and became famous overnight after performing on the NBC show Omnibus a sketch about two awkward teenagers on a date.“They invented improvisational comedy,” says Sam Wasson, author of the book Improv Nation. “And what’s striking is that you don’t often see improv performed by real actors because they’re usually two separate disciplines. With Mike and Elaine, however, both elements are operating at full power.”There was also a radical quality to May. “Female comics of that era had a ditsiness to them, whereas Elaine was playing real women who defied cliche.” These included a dispassionate, obtuse telephone operator (“Is that k as in knife? P as in pneumonia?”) and a passive-aggressive parent (“This is your mother. Do you remember me?”).“A lot of the humour we now attribute to Woody Allen, that comedy of neurosis and anxiety, really originated with them,” says Wasson. It’s telling that Allen, who later directed May in Small Time Crooks and the recent Amazon series Crisis in Six Scenes, offered to write for the couple in the late 1950s, not realising that they came up with their own material on the fly.By the end of their Broadway run in 1961, they were the toast of the town, but for May the champagne had lost its fizz. They went their separate ways soon after. “Elaine is fundamentally an improviser which means she cannot stay in one place with one idea for too long,” Wasson points out. “She was ing for pearls while Mike was waiting on the shore to polish them.”After they split, Nichols became a major director, first in theatre and then with movies such as The Graduate. May wrote plays and occasionally acted, then made her film directing debut in 1971 with A New Leaf, starring Walter Matthau as an impoverished playboy searching for a wealthy woman to marry and murder her performance as his bride-cum-victim was Chaplinesque in its pathos and slapstick skill. Her 1972 follow-up, The Heartbreak Kid, was even darker: a sour, subversive romcom in which Charles Grodin falls for Cybill Shepherd while on his honeymoon.“Elaine is one of my absolute favourite directors,” Shepherd says now. “I knew she was this brilliant comedian who had broken all the rules. But this was only my second film and I’d never taken acting lessons, so when she said, ‘Let’s improvise’ I said: ‘What’s that?’ It was so much fun, though, and such a great way to explore possibilities in a character. Having Elaine as my first improv coach was such a blessing. She didn’t try to dominate but she was always very specific about what she wanted.”Even after their professional rupture, Nichols and May would always be inextricably linked. The Graduate ends, after all, with the desperate pursuit of a woman called Elaine, while the title of May’s warped buddy movie was Mikey and Nicky. There were occasional stage reunions including a 1980 revival of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in New Haven, Connecticut, where they played George and Martha. Swoosie Kurtz, cast as Honey in that production, remembers May with fondness. “We had a lot of laughs in the dressing room. Mike would pop his head in occasionally but he would never call her Elaine. It would always be Arleen or Eileen or Irene. There was this sense of unspoken understanding between these people who had been soulmates for so long.”Kurtz was especially struck by May’s interpretation of the role. “Elaine was the first sexy Martha – really sexy, not in that sort of overweight, drunken, sloppy way we’ve sometimes seen in the character. First of all she looked sensational, with this knife-like slender body. It was very contemporary. I had never seen that kind of in-control sexuality in Martha before.”Theatre has always provided May’s foundation and, in between directing movies and polishing scripts, there has usually been something of hers to see on or off Broadway: her contribution to Relatively Speaking, a trio of one-act plays in 2011 that also included work by Woody Allen and Ethan Coen, for example, or Adult Entertainment, her comedy set in the porn industry and directed by her long-time partner, Stanley Donen (Singin’ in the Rain).Even hidden from view, her presence is strongly felt. “Anyone in American comedy attempting to show life as it really is, whether they know it or not, is a descendant of Mike and Elaine,” says Wasson. “But she is so singular that you can’t point to any one person and see her influence. It’s like looking for Mozart’s influence on classical music. It’s everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5589bf683b1e53e67f9ed3ebefcf9e33822584e/0_1620_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c27c29b58f4ba7ba1ae0712f36f642c","title":"tamara rojo interview artistic director english national ballet","story":"The artistic director of the English National Ballet on dance in the #MeToo age, embracing people’s flaws and the thing she misses most on tourBorn in Quebec and raised in Spain, London-based Tamara Rojo, 44, is the artistic director of English National Ballet, as well as lead principal dancer. She was previously a principal with the Royal Ballet. She was made a CBE in the 2016 New Year honours list.Your and choreographer Akram Khan’s recent version of Giselle reimagined her as a refugee. Is risk-taking important for ballet?It’s vital to question our traditions. Classics are classics because their essence is relevant for ever. They will always resonate, but you have to put them in a context where people recognise themselves. Ballet can seem archaic and alienating. I want it to be for and about everybody. I’m not seeking to destroy or erase anything.Do you see yourself as a figurehead for the arts?I believe the arts are essential for humanity. We can’t help but imagine, create, interpret and express ourselves artistically. It’s part of who we are. So I am a champion of the right of everyone to access the arts.Female artistic directors are few and far between. How do we change that?Boards are the gatekeepers to these positions and they’re aware they have to be erse. As those that make the decisions become more erse, so will the people they appoint to their institutions. Yet we also have short memories because the great companies of the UK were originally created by women: Sadler’s Wells, Rambert, the Royal Ballet. It was Alicia Markova who created our company. There was a time when women led our art form in the UK – but then we forgot. The first thing I did at ENB was start commissioning women to create choreography. In six years, we have staged 28 works by women.Did you support the recent move to make pointe shoes in brown and bronze colours for non-white dancers?Definitely. If you want this art form to be for everyone, it has to be inclusive. The most important thing is that these conversations are happening now.You still dance yourself. Do people constantly ask when you’ll retire?I feel older every time I’m asked! It started out as a question, but I’m wondering if it’s becoming a suggestion. Your musical instrument is your body and over time it starts to produce a different tune. Injuries accumulate over the years. I certainly don’t feel I can deliver at the level I should. I also have other things that take up my time: directing the company, collaborating with designers and composers, coming up with projects. I find that so fascinating that I struggle to drag myself into the studio to take class and keep myself fit.Is it hard to imagine not dancing?I’ve been a dancer since I was five. Most dancers can’t remember when it wasn’t part of our lives. It’s always difficult to stop. I’m lucky I’ve found something I’m equally passionate about. That makes it easier.Your relationship with male principal Isaac Hernández, 16 years your junior, has attracted criticism. Did that surprise you?I’m a very private person, so I did find it quite difficult. I wondered if it would be the same if it was an older man with a younger woman. But I’m very fortunate to have found somebody I want to spend my life with and who shares my passion. I’m happy – but I feel that is also something that bothers people!The dance world has seen claims of bullying and sexual exploitation. Is that changing in the age of #MeToo?What’s changed is the style in which work is carried out. In the past, the ballet master was an almost godlike figure. You did what he said and there was no room for conversation. Certainly at the ENB, that’s not the case. We encourage dancers to have opinions, ask questions and contribute to the process. The work is good because it’s the work of everyone in the company.Do you find it hard working with dancers who are less gifted than you?I was not particularly gifted. I was very hard-working. I respect commitment to what we do. Maybe sometimes that makes me challenging.What do you miss most when you’re touring?My washing machine. It sounds mundane but when you don’t have one, it becomes a luxury. Dancers are always rehearsing and sweating. I don’t enjoy washing my clothes in a hotel bathroom.What do you remember about collecting your CBE?It was an amazing honour. My parents came over from Spain, and to share it with so many veterans from the armed forces was emotional. You could see how proud their families are. It was one of the most moving days of my life.We’re entering a busy season for ballet. Are you working over Christmas?We’re doing two shows per day for six weeks but this year, because of where Christmas lands, I have two-and-half days off. So for the first time in a decade, I’m going to see my family in Spain. There will be lots of eating, drinking and laughing. All the generations together.What does the new year hold?In March, we move into our new purpose-built HQ in east London.

They pack more sass and sex appeal into their dinky two-wheel frames than almost any other vehicle – and we have both the romantic Romans and the moody Mods to thank for that.Cheap, nimble and easy to use, the scooter became an instant hit on Rome’s crowded streets in the early 1950s. Women could ride while wearing a skirt and the machine’s concealed engine – tucked under the seat or perched over its small back wheel – kept oil, grease and dirt from spoiling their clothes. The Vespa’s starring role in Roman Holiday, that gorgeous 1953 romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, is said to have been worth 100,000 sales at the time. People watched the glamorous Hollywood couple buzzing around the ancient city and wanted to do the same. Then, a decade later, the Mods scooted in, swarming Britain’s seaside resorts on their highly customised, glittering Lambrettas. Suddenly the bikes were both stylish and culturally significant.But those were the glory days and, since then, most scooters have become little more than irritating city mopeds. Which is why aficionados will soon be digging out their Ray-Bans and Harringtons to welcome the rebirth of one of the chicest scooters of all time: the Čezeta. Pronounced Chuh-zeh-tuh, it started life in 1957. Its aerodynamic shape was inspired by the rocket aesthetics of lunar travel. Czechoslovakia didn’t have a foot in the space race, but the country was the world’s greatest motorcycle producer and was riding a wave of postwar optimism. The Čezeta’s radical and futuristic look, created by motorcycle racer Jaroslav František Koch, embodied so much of his country’s promise.Koch’s Type 501, usually compared to a torpedo or, less flatteringly, a pig, became an immediate hit with young Czechs. But despite its winning appeal, production stuttered to a close in 1964. Fast forward to 2008, and a Brit named Neil Eamonn Smith moved to Prague and bought his first vintage scooter. He started restoring Čezetas and began to experiment with electric conversions. With expertise from the Czech Technical University, he perfected the powertrain and a few years later launched the Type 506. Mods and romantics rejoice!The original design of the Čezeta is unique among scooters. It is unusually long, at almost 2m. It has footboards running its entire length and a long and comfortable seat that can be lifted to reveal a luggage compartment. This makes it ideal for two people. The front mudguard is fixed to the body and fully streamlined, while the characterful headlight fits into a recess and has a luggage rack on the flat top surface.Smith’s all-new, electric 506 has an 11kW rear hub motor which is powered by the same Panasonic 18650 lithium battery cells used by Tesla. Two versions of the scooter are available. An everyday model with a top speed of 53mph and a more powerful one which will hit 75mph. Both are easy to handle and a joy to ride. Power comes via a patented two-way “Sway” throttle. Roll it back as usual to accelerate, then roll it forward to brake (which also recuperates energy back to the battery). The swaying motion of your arm gave them the inspiration for its name. The left handlebar has a selector to choose between three ride modes as well as reverse. You don’t need a bike licence, but you’ll need to take the CBT test – and wear a helmet.

Are they a boon or a threat?Alan Turing’s famous test of whether machines could fool us into believing they were human – “the imitation game” – has become a mundane, daily question for all of us. We are surrounded by machine voices, and think nothing of conversing with them – though each time I hear my car tell me where to turn left I am reminded of my grandmother, who having installed a telephone late in life used to routinely say goodnight to the speaking clock.We find ourselves locked into interminable text chats with breezy automated bank tellers and offer our mother’s maiden name to a variety of robotic speakers that sound plausibly alive. I’ve resisted the domestic spies of Apple and Amazon, but one or two friends jokingly describe the rapport they and their kids have built up with Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Home Hub – and they are right about that: the more you tell your virtual valet, the more you disclose of wants and desires, the more speedily it can learn and commit to memory those last few fragments of your inner life you had kept to yourself.Naturally, because of the scale of the task, they must enlist bots to help them find bots. The most accessible automated Turing test is the creation of Professor Emilio Ferrara, principal investigator in machine intelligence and data science at the University of Southern California. In its infancy the bot-detector “BotOrNot?” allowed you to use many of the conventional indicators of automation – abnormal account activity, repetition, generic profiles – to determine the origin of a Twitter feed. Now called the Botometer (after the original was targeted by copycat hacks), it boasts a sophisticated algorithm based on all it has learned. It’s a neat trick. You can feed it your own – or anyone else’s – Twitter name and quickly establish how bot-like your bon mots are. On a scale where zero is human and five is machine, mine scored 0.2, putting @TimAdamsWrites on a sentient level with @JeremyCorbyn, but – disturbingly – slightly more robotic than @theresa_may.Designed to help those suffering from depression by facilitating quick conversations. It will even check up on you every now and then to see how you are doing. The company bills it as a “robot friend, who’s ready to listen”.An AI chatbot aimed at helping you to organise your finances.

However, it doesn’t respond too well to questions.

It can be asked about the status of lines, and when asked how to get from A to B will provide three links with the fastest route.A health coach that can help users manage the symptoms of hypertension, diabetes etc. Using data gathered from the user’s connected devices, it makes data-driven nudges and recommendations to encourage healthier behaviour.The Olly Murs official chatbot can answer questions about the singer, provide fans with information about his upcoming tours and offer playlists of his music. The bot replicates the celebrity’s tone by calling himself “29+3” years old and ending messages with winking emojis.\u0026nbspCreated by mattress company Casper, this chatbot allows sleepless users to message it for recommendations and suggestions that may improve their sleeping routine. Harry LyeSpeaking to me on the phone last week, Ferrara explained how in the five years since BotOrNot has been up and running, detection has become vastly more complex. “The advance in artificial intelligence and natural language processing makes the bots better each day,” he says. The incalculable data sets that Google and others have harvested from our incessant online chatter are helping to make bots sound much more like us.The Botometer is powered by two systems. One is a “white box” that has been trained over the years to examine statistical patterns in the language, Ferrara says, “as well as the sentiment, the opinion,” of tweets. In all there are more than 1,200 weighted features that a Twitter feed is measured against to determine if it has a pulse. Alongside that, the Botometer has a “black-box model” fed with a mass of data from bots and humans, which has developed its own sets of criteria to separate man from machine. Ferrara and his team are not exactly sure what this system relies on for its judgments, but they are impressed by its accuracy.When Ferrara started on this work, he felt he had developed his own sixth sense for sniffing out artificial intelligence on Twitter. Now he is no longer so confident. “Today it is not clear to me that I interact with as many humans as I thought I did,” he says. “We look hard at some accounts, we run them through the algorithm and it is undecided. Quite often now it is a coin toss. The language seems too good to be true.”Not all bots aim to deceive many perform routine operations. Bots were originally created to help automate repetitive tasks, saving companies money and time. Some bots help to refresh your Facebook feed, or keep you up to date with the weather. On social media, bots were originally coded to search for hashtags and keywords and retweet or amplify messages: “OMG have you seen this?!” They acted as cheerleaders for Justin Bieber or Star Wars or Taylor Swift. There were “vanity bots” which added numbers and fake “likes” to profiles to artificially enhance their status, and “traffic bots” designed to drive customers to a particular shopping site. There were also bots that acted as grammarians, making pedantic corrections to tweets, or simple gags like Robot J McCarthy, which sought out conversations using the word “communist” and replied with a nonsensical slogan.At some point political bots entered the fray, mostly on Twitter, with the intent of spreading propaganda and misinformation. Originally these seem to have been the work of inidual hackers, before the techniques were adopted by organised and lavishly funded groups. These bots, Ferrara suggests, proved to be a highly efffective way to broadcast extremist viewpoints and spread conspiracy theories, but also were programmed to search out such views from other, genuine accounts by liking, sharing, retweeting and following, in order to give them disproportionate prominence. It is these bots that the social media platforms have been trying to cull in the wake of investigations into the 2016 American election by Robert Mueller and others. Twitter has taken down a reported 6m bot accounts this year.The unseen global army of “bot herders”, those shadowy iniduals and corporations and rogue government agencies that send their bots out into the virtual world, have a couple of advantages in this latter respect. One is that they are now able to find enormous amounts of natural-language data to develop the next generation of talkative bots. The other is that these creations can exploit our tendency to ascribe trusted human characteristics to voices even if, on a rational level, we suspect that they are artificial. That psychology is as old as electronic communication itself.All modern chatbots trace their family tree back to the experiments by Joseph Weizenbaum with Eliza, named after Ms Dolittle in Pygmalion for “her” ability to master received pronunciation. In 1966, Weizenbaum, a German-American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created a prototype chatbot that searched for keywords in conversations conducted with humans typing at keyboards. The rudimentary program would pick up these words and use them in its reply. If it did not locate a useful word, it would offer a neutral response. Weizenbaum set up Eliza to mimic the tone and manner of an east coast psychotherapist, a dynamic that allowed its voice to “adopt the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world”.The professor had assumed that his bit of trickery would be a useful way of teaching his students about the structures of language and dialogue. What he discovered however, was that several of them became hooked on conversing with Eliza and telling her their troubles, opening up to the program as if it were a therapist. When Weizenbaum’s secretary asked him to leave the room one morning because she was in the middle of a session with Eliza, he became alarmed by the general willingness to be so seduced by a machine voice. He published an academic paper which included the first notable conversation between woman and machine. It went like this.Woman: Men are all alike.Eliza: In what way?W: They’re always bugging us about something or other.E: Can you think of a specific example?W: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.E: Your boyfriend made you come here?W: He says I’m depressed much of the time.E: I am sorry to hear that you are depressed.W: It’s true. I am unhappy.E: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?W: I need some help, that much seems certain.E: What would it mean to you if you got some help?W: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.E: Tell me more about your family.W: My mother takes care of me.E: Who else in your family takes care of you?W: My father.E: Your father?W: You are like my father in some ways.E: What resemblance do you see?W: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don’t want me to notice that.E: What makes you think I am not very aggressive?W: You don’t argue with me…The many progeny of Eliza have evolved into chatbots – bits of software designed to mimic human conversation. They include recent entries into the annual Loebner prize, which offers chatbot contestants the chance to fool a panel of human judges with their intelligence. The comforting principle of telling our deepest fears to a machine is also exploited in various “therapy” platforms, marketed as a genuine alternative to conventional talking cures. Each of them trades on the idea of our fundamental desire to be listened to, the impulse which shapes social media.Lisa-Maria-Neudert is part of the computational propaganda project at Oxford University, which studies the ways in which political bots have been used to spread disinformation and distort online discourse. She argues that the seductive intimacy of chatbots will prove to be the next battleground in this ongoing war.In the beginning, Neudert suggests, the bots would rely on volume. “For example,” she says, “in the Arab spring bots were flooding hashtags that activists were using underground in order to make the conversation useless.” Or, like Eliza, bots would respond to a keyword to get a marginal topic trending, and, often, into the news. This was an effective but blunt instrument. “If I tweet something saying ‘I hate Trump’,” Neudert explains, an old-style bot “would send me a message about Trump because it is responding to that keyword. But if I say ‘I love Trump’, it would send me the same message.” These bots were not smart enough to recognise intent, but that is changing. “The commercial companies that are using artificial intelligence and natural language processing right now are already building such technologies. What we are doing as a project is to try to find out if the political actors are already using them also.”Neudert is particularly interested in the new generation of branded chatbots that push content and initiate conversations on messaging platforms. Such chatbots – which openly declare themselves to be automated – represent a new way for businesses and news services to attract your attention, giving the impression of speaking just to you. She imagines the propaganda bots will use the same technology, but without declaring themselves. “They’ll present themselves as human users participating in online conversation in comment sections, group chats, and message boards.”At present the feasibility of a truly conversational chatbot, one that can understand the context of any conversational gambit, pick up tonal ambiguities and retain a sense of how the discussion is evolving, is still a long way off. The new generation of chatbots might be good at answering direct questions or interrupting debates, but they are ill-equipped to sustain coherence over a range of subjects.There are a number of fast-growing companies that are beginning offer the kind of technology that Neudert describes, as a legitimate marketing tool. Several are official partners of Facebook in order to use its Messenger service. They include the market-leading Russian-based company Chatfuel, which has enabled thousands of organisations to build Messenger chatbots, including headline acts such as the NFL and the Labour party, and a number of smaller operations such as Berlin-based Spectrm, which has created Messenger chatbots for the likes of CNN and Red Bull.I spoke to Max Koziolek, one of the founders of Spectrm, who is (predictably) evangelical about this new way of businesses speaking “like a friend” to their users and customers.Increasingly we will become used to almost every entity in our lives “talking to us as if it is a friend”, he suggests, a relationship that will require certain rules of engagement. “If you send messages after 11pm that’s bad. And also if you send too many. I wouldn’t send more than two messages a day as a publisher, for example. It’s a very intimate space. A friend is sending me relevant information and at the right time.”Far from being a new frontier in the propaganda wars, Koziolek believes – hugely optimistically – that such direct conversation could help to clear the internet of hate speech, giving users more control over who they hear from.Does it matter whether they know that the chat is from a machine?“We don’t see big differences,” he says. “Sometimes our bots have a clear personality and sometimes they don’t. Bots which have a personality will always say goodnight, for example. Or ‘How are you?’”Do those types of bots produce longer conversations?“Different kinds of conversations. Even though you know this thing is a robot, you behave differently toward it. I would say you cannot avoid that. Even though you know it is a machine, you immediately talk to it just like it is a human.”This blurring of those lines is less welcome to observers like Ferrara, who has had a front-row seat in the changing dialogues between human and machine. I wonder, in observing at close quarters for so long if he has, anecdotally, felt the mood of conversations changing, if interactions have become angrier?What aspect of this behaviour alarmed him the most?“The most striking thing to me to this day is that people are really, really bad at assessing the source of information,” he says. One thing his team have shown is that the rate at which people retweet information from bots is identical to that from humans. “That is concerning for all sorts of reasons.”Despite the revelation of such findings, he gets frustrated that people, for political purposes, still seek to dismiss the ways in which these phenomena have changed the nature of online discourse. As if the most targeted propaganda, employed on the most unregulated of mass media, had no effect on opinion or behaviour.One of his later projects has been to try to show how quickly messages can spread from, and be adopted by, targeted user groups. Last year, Ferrara’s team received permission to introduce a series of “good” health messages to Twitter via bots posing as humans. They quickly built up thousands of followers, revealing the ways in which a flood of messages, from apparently like-minded agents, can very quickly and effectively change the tone and attitude of online conversation.Unfortunately, such “good” bots are vastly outnumbered by those seeking to spread discord and disinformation. Where does he place his faith in a solution?“This is not a problem you can solve with technology alone,” he says. “You need tech, you need some system of regulation that incentivises companies to do that. It requires a lot of money. And then you need public opinion to care enough to want to do something about it.”I suggest to him that there seems to be a grain of hope in the fact that people are reaching out in greater numbers toward trusted, fact-checked news sources: subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post are up (and the  and Observer just notched up a million online supporters)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

Although they have the support of senior officials in the US defence and state departments, they face opposition from the White House, particularly from the national security adviser, John Bolton.Nor is it clear whether Moscow is interested in a deal. The collapse of the INF would leave the Russian military free to deploy short- and medium-range nuclear missiles along its borders with Nato in Europe, and in China.It would be hard for the US to benefit militarily from the treaty’s demise, as it would need allied states to offer launch sites for its missiles if they were to be deployed within range of Russia and China – and it is far from clear what country would offer its territory and thus make itself a target.Yet Trump’s abrupt declaration at a political rally in Nevada on 20 October that he was going to pull the US out of the treaty, without informing allies, has focused criticism on Washington rather than Moscow. European officials have asked for time to make a last-gasp attempt to rescue the treaty, which they see as a key pillar of arms control in Europe.They have sought to persuade their American counterparts that US abrogation of the treaty – without giving Russia a final opportunity to come into compliance – could further undermine global support for the US, and allow Moscow to escape the full blame for the treaty’s breakdown.“The US administration needs to take the Europeans with them,” a European diplomat said. “It’s important that if the agreement fails it is clear to everyone that it is the Russians’ fault. I think the administration gets this.”Trump will meet Vladimir Putin and the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of this month, but it is not clear that the issue will be raised. Bolton told Putin when they met in Moscow in October that Trump had made up his mind to dump the treaty, which has kept nuclear missiles out of Europe for more than three decades.The US has been accusing Russia of violating the treaty for more than four years, through the development and deployment of a new ground-launched medium-range missile. Nevertheless, Trump’s declaration of intent on October 20 to pull the US out of the treaty marked a sharp break in US policy, which until then had been to ratchet up pressure on Russia, in part by the US announcing plans to develop its own counterpart missile, to use as a bargaining chip.The declaration took the defence and state departments by surprise. A cabinet-level meeting to discuss policy on the INF scheduled for 15 October was scrapped without explanation by Bolton, officials said.Russia has denied its new weapon violates the INF restrictions banning nuclear missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500km. It also accuses the US of breaking the treaty on the grounds that launchers for interceptors in the Aegis ground-based missile defence system in Romania and soon to be deployed in Poland, could be used for an offensive cruise missile.Russia has so far not agreed to allow inspections of its new missile or suggested any compromise involving the Aegis missile-defence system. The US has also been uncompromising. In the last discussions between Washington and Moscow on the INF, in June, the US arms control ambassador, John Ordway, passed on a US demand for a freeze in Russian deployment of its new missile.According to sources familiar with the Russian account of the talks, Ordway’s terms also included a requirement for Moscow to admit it had violated the treaty, a condition the Kremlin was almost certain to refuse.The state department confirmed Ordway’s meeting with a Russian delegation, but declined to provide further details.Under the terms of the treaty, it would take six months for a US withdrawal to take effect, from the date of Washington’s formal notification of its intention to withdraw. But in the month since Trump’s declaration in Nevada, no such notification has been made.The under secretary of state for arms control and international security, Andrea Thompson, told journalists on Thursday that no decision on timing had been made and appeared to suggest the president had not yet made a final decision on withdrawal.“We’re in the middle of the interagency process. I don’t want to get ahead of it. Know that everyone involved with this is all hands on deck and getting information so that the president has everything that he needs to make the next decision,” Thompson said. She added that the US was sharing intelligence with Nato allies to help build support for the US case on the INF.“The bottom line is they support us. They ask for more information. Obviously, the intelligence is key on showing partners and allies the continued violations. And we’re talking through next steps, and that’s the important thing, that it’s a collaborative process whether it’s with Nato partners or here at home, that we’re getting input for next steps to make sure that there is no gap between us as – when the president makes his decision.”A group of US, Russian and German nuclear weapons experts, known as the Deep Cuts commission issued a statement on Sunday, warning of the dangers of allowing the INF to break down, and arguing for another effort to negotiate a compromise.“The repercussions of a collapse of the INF treaty would be tremendous: it could trigger a new arms race, significantly increase the risk of nuclear escalation, further undermine political relations between the United States, Russia and Europe,” the commission said.“We believe the United States and Russia should exhaust all cooperative options to solve the INF treaty crisis instead of scrapping the treaty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc6dd99ae2b22f6b7299c91f871844bc2980ccea/0_156_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a0b6dfddafe29efc8a3ab4d068c487","title":"mitzvah day jews muslims chicken soup east london mosque","story":"Traditional Jewish dish is prepared at East London mosque on day of social actionIt is a beloved Jewish dish, served at Shabbat dinners to family and friends and reputed to have powerful medicinal properties. It is not normally cooked or served in a mosque.But on Sunday, vast quantities of chicken soup – often known as “Jewish penicillin” – were being made at the East London mosque by Jewish and Muslim volunteers to be distributed to homeless centres.Mounds of carrots, garlic, onions and celery were peeled and chopped on long benches by Muslim scouts, volunteers from Muslim Aid, members of the B’nai B’rith Youth Organisation and the New Stoke Newington Shul.At another table, LSE student Emily Otvos instructed fellow students on the preparation of matzo balls, the traditional dumpling served with chicken soup – despite confessing that she usually left them on the side.Tahir Iqbal, events director of Elite Caterers, was in charge of preparing 90 halal chickens for the pot. His company, which caters for Asian weddings and corporate events, donated the ingredients, equipment and transport for the cookathon.“This is a new experience for us. I’ve never made Jewish chicken soup before, but I’ve been practising for two weeks, including on my family,” he said. The nearest Asian equivalent was chicken yakhni, a spicy broth, he added.Across the UK, more than 2,500 servings of soup – kosher, halal, vegetarian and vegan – were being cooked at 20 venues, with soup-making events also taking place in Germany, Poland, South Africa and Australia, as part of Mitzvah Day – a day of social action led by the Jewish community but involving people of other faiths and no faith.Other activities undertaken by more than 40,000 volunteers around the world included hosting tea parties for refugees, collecting and sorting clothes and food for those in need, cleaning up cemeteries and parks, and visiting care homes.At East London mosque, 900 servings of chicken soup and more than 100 portions of vegetarian (spinach, walnut and yogurt) soup were being delivered to projects run by the Salvation Army, St Mungo’s and the Acre Lane Centre, based in Brixton, south London.“Chicken soup is the Jewish food of choice,” said Laura Marks, the founder and chair of Mitzvah Day. “As well as its famed medicinal properties, it has all sorts of emotional properties – friendship, family, togetherness, love, nurture – they’re all in that bowl.”There was a common perception that Jews and Muslims did not get on, she said. “But Mitzvah Day is about the common values that underlie both religions – the commitment to social action and social justice. We are both commanded by our faith to do good deeds and contribute to society. Most of the Jews here today won’t have been in a mosque before, and most Muslims won’t have Jewish friends. But here we are, chopping vegetables together.”The East London mosque is one of the largest in Europe, and serves the UK’s biggest Muslim community. Until three years ago, there was a tiny synagogue next door, a remnant of the once-thriving Jewish community of the east end. It closed and was sold to the mosque.Jehangir Malik, the chief executive of Muslim Aid, which teamed up with Mitzvah Day for the event, said that in the 1930s the area would have been full of Jews. The chicken soup cookathon was “a wonderful initiative to bring our two communities together in a part of London which is meaningful to both of us and to spread a positive interfaith message around the world”.At 12.30pm, as cooked chicken was being shredded for the first batch of soup, the Muslim call to prayer rang out. “Food brings us together,” said Marks."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3701961.1542552183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar criticises fianna f%C3%A1il for dragging out government talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  addressing the delegates at Fine Gael Ardfheis.

Fianna Fáil is dragging it out a bit.“I have no doubt that if both parties wanted to do it we could do it in a weekend.”Mr Varadkar accepted that his promise at the ardfheis to raise the threshold for the higher rate of tax to €50,000 over five years would cost €3. 2 billion but said that would involve only devoting a quarter of additional resources to tax reductions.He denied it would favour the rich, saying it would be designed for middle-income tax payers. He also argued that if the Government did nothing, more and more people would fall into the higher tax next each year, as they received increments, and pay increases, that would bring their income to more than €34,000.Turning to Brexit, the Taoiseach said a hard border was not inevitable in the event of a No deal but would be very difficult.He said there were many ways in which a hard border could be avoided. He cited the UK staying in a customs union, a Northern Ireland-specific backstop which would be a Canada Plus scenario, and a Norway Plus where the whole of the UK would stay in the single market and in the customs union.Asked if the consequences of Irish success in achieving all its red lines was it would be more difficult to get the deal through in Britain, he said: “It was always difficult to get a deal through. It is evident to me that politics in Britain is very ided.“Even if there was second referendum what would the question be? Would it be remain or leave? Or would it be deal or no deal?“They are in a very difficult situation but sadly one they have put themselves in.”He said a majority of the Labour party supported remaining in the EU but they had a leader “who is a hard Brexiteer himself”.“I actually wonder if anyone who is actually against this has a majority for anything else,” he asked.He was asked about former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab’s claim yesterday that the Taoiseach made public and misrepresented a confidential conversation Mr Raab had with Simon Coveney.“I don’t know Dominic Raab, never met him, never spoke to him.“I don’t know anything about this conversation he had with Simon Coveney. I can only imagine that Simon Coveney maintained his confidence. My dealings are with prime minister (Theresa) May.“When it comes to double-dealing and back-stabbing and negative briefing and intrigue and all that kind of thing it is not something in our playbook.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

They are going to show us the photos. They say that our youngsters are inside, said Yolanda Mendiola, the mother of crewman Leandro Cisneros, 28. We are all destroyed here.Relatives are now asking for authorities to extract the submarine, though whether such an operation will be undertaken remains unclear.Relatives of the crew of the ARA San Juan submarine wait outside the navy base in Mar del PlataRaising the submarine to the surface is not impossible, but it is a very complex operation, and therefore very expensive, a naval officer told AFP, requesting anonymity.The discovery came the day after a somber ceremony, which Macri attended, at the San Juan\u0027s Mar del Plata base on the first anniversary of its disappearance.It also came just before the Seabed Constructor was to leave for maintenance in South Africa.

They may have taken out Khashoggi\u0027s dismembered corpse inside luggage without facing problems due to their diplomatic immunity,” said Mr Akar, according to CNN Turk.The CIA reportedly believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the hit - but Donald Trump says any conclusions are \u0026#34very premature\u0026#34Turkey has said a 15-man team was involved in the killing.Last week, a Saudi prosecutor said the body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed to an unidentified “local co-operator”.On Friday, US news organisations reported that the CIA had concluded that responsibility stretched to the very top of the country’s ruling family.However, Mr Trump, who is under pressure to distance the US from a close ally, has pushed back, saying the conclusion was “very premature”.“We\u0027ll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday,” Mr Trump said on Saturday.His position was backed by the State Department, which issued a statement saying the US had not yet come to a final conclusion about who ordered the killing.Tory MPs lie about submitting no confidence letters, says Sir Graham Brady Anti-poaching dog makes remarkable recovery after lion attack in Kruger National ParkBrexit live: Theresa May warns Tory MPs no-confidence vote could stop Brexit and tells \u0026#39Gang of Five\u0026#39 her deal cannot be changed - latest updatesNetanyahu holds last-ditch talks to keep Israeli government together\u0026#39Assaults, fights, stabbings\u0026#39: More than 400 injured in France\u0026#39s yellow vest protests Public trust in bankers has doubled in the past five yearsSwimmer dies in suspected stingray attack in Australia, after two mauled by sharks in horror weekendProsecutors leave Bloody Sunday veterans in legal limboStrictly Come Dancing 2018, Blackpool special: Ashley Roberts tops seaside scoreboard with first perfect 40 of seriesWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? Which Conservative MPs have sent no-confidence letters to the 1922 Committee?Ignore the scare stories our food is safe, say US officialsPeople with severe mental health problems forced to wait longer for NHS help than those with mild depressionGlenda Jackson revisits Mary Queen of Scots drama as forgotten Hollywood script is revived for radioBusiness leaders urge Theresa May to introduce new laws on mental health first aid in the workplaceSadiq Khan criticised over 60 per cent rise in staff costs at City Hall since taking officeComment: The Brexit chaos unleashed by Theresa May is only just beginningTrump declines to blame Saudi prince over Khashoggi killing despite reports CIA hold him responsible Vicar of Dibley actor John Bluthal dies aged 89Democrat concedes Florida governor\u0026#39s race to ally of Donald TrumpWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/18/TELEMMGLPICT000181292206_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"netanyahu holds last ditch talks keep israeli government together","story":"Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026#39s right-wing coalition has been thrown into chaosBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, resisted calls for snap polls Sunday, saying elections now would be unnecessary and wrong, ahead of what he called last-ditch talks to hold his embattled coalition together.Mr Netanyahu\u0027s Right-wing coalition was thrown into crisis Wednesday after the defence minister Avigdor Lieberman\u0027s resignation over a controversial Gaza ceasefire deal, leading to speculation over whether early elections have become inevitable.After Mr Lieberman\u0027s withdrawal along with his Yisrael Beitenu party, Mr Netanyahu\u0027s government was left clinging to a one-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament.Key coalition partners say that is unworkable.Mr Netanyahu, who has sought to delay calling elections, made his case at the start of a cabinet meeting on Sunday. Yuval Steinitz, energy minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and government secretary Tzahi Braverman attend the weekly cabinet meetingIn a period of security sensitivity, it\u0027s unnecessary and wrong to go to elections, Mr Netanyahu said.He noted past instances when Right-wing governments had called elections that did not turn out as they had hoped.We need to do whatever we can to avoid such mistakes, he said.Mr Netanyahu planned to meet Moshe Kahlon, the finance minister whose centre-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats, at later on Sunday for what he called a last attempt to keep the government together.Elections are not due until November 2019.Mr Kahlon has said he does not think it is possible to continue with the existing coalition.Mr Netanyahu said on November 18 it would be \u0026#34unnecessary and wrong\u0026#34 to call snap pollsIf (Mr Netanyahu) pulls a rabbit out of his hat, we\u0027ll see, Mr Kahlon told Israeli television Saturday. Meanwhile, I don\u0027t see a rabbit or a hat.Naftali Bennett, the education minister of the far-right Jewish Home party, which holds eight seats in parliament, has demanded the defence portfolio as a way of keeping the government together.Netanyahu says he will take it over at least temporarily rather than hand the key ministry to one of his main right-wing rivals, though a last-minute deal could not be ruled out.On Saturday, Bennett told Israeli television that Lieberman had collapsed the government.There is no more government and we are heading towards elections, he said.

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement. By Friday afternoon 21 MPs had publicly submitted letters backing a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Amazon will go bankrupt, the billionaire said, replying\u0026nbspto an employee who asked him about the company\u0027s\u0026nbspfuture, in relation to the bankruptcies of big US retailers such as Sears.If you look at large companies, their lifes tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.Amazon picks New York City and Arlington for new headquartersA recording of the meeting was heard by\u0026nbspCNBC.In it, Mr Bezos\u0026nbspadded that the way for Amazon to stay successful is for staff to obsess over customers.If we start to focus on ourselves, instead of focusing on our customers, that will be the beginning of the end, he said.His comments accompany a wave of major success for Amazon, even as the company comes under heightened scrutiny.Amazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employeesOn Tuesday Amazon\u0026nbspannounced that New York City and Arlington, Virginia had been picked as the locations for its new headquarters, with a $5bn investment planned across both sites.Both Amazon\u0026nbspand local authorities in New York attracted heavy criticism after the company\u0026nbsprevealed that it would receive around $1.5bn in incentives,\u0026nbspbased on job creation targets, in Long Island City, and $573m in Arlington.\u0026nbspTwo of the sites chosen for Amazon\u0027s new campus in the city were originally intended for affordable housing and the decision is now likely to cost the city around 1,500 residential units intended for low and middle-income\u0026nbspNew Yorkers, according to\u0026nbspPolitico.\u0026nbspThe announcement followed an extensive beauty pageant process, which saw 238 competing proposals submitted from locations across the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAmazon, which now employs\u0026nbspmore than 600,000 people worldwide, said salaries at its two new bases would average more than $150,000, with hiring set to start next year.Staff at the company told\u0026nbspCNBC\u0026nbspthat employees are worried about the impact of government regulation and potential antitrust violations.In September the EU\u0027s antitrust watchdog launched a preliminary investigation\u0026nbspwhich is examining how Amazon uses data from\u0026nbspthird-party merchants.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They also discern that the most likely future path is for the UK to stay in the EU customs union. This is because:It will be guaranteed to do\u0026nbspso during the transition periodThe transition period could easily be extendedIt will be impossible for the UK to leave the customs union without the EU’s acquiescence andThe indications from leaked Brussels documents are that the EU sees UK membership of the customs union as the central feature of the future trading relationship.For 29 months, those in business have sought clarity and found only fog. For now, and despite every sign that the deal will be rejected by the Commons (at least initially) they are urging its acceptance – if only as the classic lesser of two evils.Mike Hawes, head\u0026nbspof the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders – representing millions of jobs and major UK export sector – was typical of many when he said: “For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of no deal and securing a transition period.”The CBI echoed that view, saying: “This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transition period as a step back from the cliff edge.”The business world has for the most part\u0026nbsptried throughout the Brexit process to be as apolitical as possible. One of the more outspoken companies is Young’s, the pub firm, which said: “We have got as much as we can from a business perspective, and we need politicians to support this.”Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy will be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the poundThat provides an interesting counterpoint to the vocal pro-Brexit boss of Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, whose objections to the EU’s protectionism are well-known. Small business too has usually been more ided than big business, though in Northern Ireland, understandably, there is near unanimous support for the no hard-border deal secured by the government.The verdict of investors can be read more easily in the pound’s value, share prices and trading volumes than in press releases. As political backing for the Brexit deal started to unravel this week a familiar pattern re-emerged, reversing the upswing we had seen when it seemed there was solid cabinet support.\u0026nbspShares sank in companies that relied heavily on the UK market – housebuilders and banks for example – while those that are global and whose earnings are mostly non-sterling enjoyed a boost (because their euro, yen and dollar profits would buy more pounds when they are “brought home”). Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy would be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the pound to make UK exports\u0026nbspcheaper and overcome tariff disadvantages.There is a wider question, too, about the Brexit debate, which was colourfully summed up when Boris Johnson, when still foreign secretary, was reported as saying “f***\u0026nbspbusiness” in an overheated exchange. In other words, whatever the CBI wants is not necessarily the best for the UK economy as a whole.Thus, the Brexit debate can be seen as an argument between the producer interest\u0026nbsp– big business – and the consumer interest\u0026nbsp– families. The EU, through tariffs and other barriers,\u0026nbspprotects its\u0026nbspbusiness,\u0026nbspespecially farming, from global competition. The bloc\u0026nbspprovides a supply of cheap labour and makes food, clothing and many manufactured goods more expensive than they need be. For the public, yes, jobs would be lost in the short term in a hard Brexit, but there would be gains as the budgets of lower-income families would go further in the shops.\u0026nbspSo, just as in the referendum two years ago, business is mostly hostile to Brexit, as well as frustrated about the continuing uncertainties. Even now, business leaders have no clear idea about what the business environment will be like after 11pm on 29 March\u0026nbsp2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

have led to an increasing number of councils seeking injunction orders over the past yearGypsies and travellers are being “hounded out” of parts of England\u0026nbspas a growing number of local

on,\u0026nbspleading to\u0026nbspmental health issues and disruption to children’s development, as a string of councils obtain wide high court injunction orders ban unauthorised encampments across entire towns.Lawyers, MPs and charities accused ministers of “ratcheting up”\u0026nbspaction against travellers on unauthorised sites without ensuring there was enough supply\u0026nbspto address the “chronic shortage” of authorised encampments\u0026nbspacross the country.Roma gypsies warned over risk of deportation after BrexitDiscriminating against Gypsies and Travellers is ‘common’ in BritainMet told to reinvestigate ‘abuse’ of Gypsies on police Facebook pageCuts to local authority funding, as well as an “increasingly hostile” attitude towards travelling communities,\u0026nbsphave led to an increasing number of councils seeking injunction orders over the past year, campaigners said.Injunctions have been obtained by 22 councils since the first one was granted by Harlow Council in\u0026nbspEssex in 2015, with several other local authorities currently pursuing them in the courts.The latest government figures show there were 22,946 traveller caravans in England in January 2018, of which 87 per cent were on authorised land and 13 per cent on unauthorised land.The number of caravans on unauthorised land increased by 2 per cent in the year\u0026nbspto January 2018, but the proportion of these that are “not tolerated”, meaning either a planning enforcement notice has been served or an injunction has been sought, rose more sharply, by 20 per cent, from 1,402 to 1,679.Michelle Gavin, projects manager at support organisation Friends, Families and Travellers, said the use of injunction orders was\u0026nbsp”insidious” and that the biggest issue was\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplack of site provision nationally.“It was successful in Harlow, because people left the area, but then of course it goes onto the next county and the next county,” she said.“The reason people are facing these blanket ban injunctions is because there are no new sites being built.\u0026nbspThe majority of people affected by these\u0026nbspinjunctions have nowhere to live, nowhere authorised on which to encamp, because there’s a chronic shortage\u0026nbspacross the country.“With no sites being built and children being born with emerging need, you are literally waiting for people to die to be able to access any site provision.”The injunction orders are usually against “persons unknown”, meaning anyone found to occupy the land may be imprisoned, fined or have their property seized – which lawyers described as “inhumane”.Roma gypsies warned over risk of deportation after BrexitIn an open letter\u0026nbspearlier this month to Lord Bourne, the minister responsible for faith issues, 27 MPs, lawyers and charities, including co-leader of the Green Party Sian Berry, urged the government to centrally take control of the situation and ensure provision of permanent and transit pitches.The letter, written by Brigitta Balogh, who is set to become Britain’s first Roma barrister, described the injunctions as a “deliberate act to force the community to settle ...\u0026nbspand renounce its nomadic heritage and leave its traditions behind, potentially breaching Human Rights legislation”.Marc Willers, a barrister at Garden Court Chambers who represents gypsies affected by the wide injunctions, said\u0026nbspthe bans were leading to overcrowding on sites, as well as a deterioration in mental and physical health of traveller communities.“When they turn up wherever these injunctions have been granted, unbeknownst to them, they will be hit with it and told you can’t park anywhere in this borough or within this area, so they’ve got to move on,” he said.“The problem is, if the next borough has the same injunction in place, they then have to move again, and there’s nowhere else for them to go. They’re being driven into the sea.“The sites which are available and do have planning permission are getting more and more overcrowded, people are doubling up – there will be a pitch with permission for one caravan, and there will be two squeezed onto it.“It creates a lot of anxiety and can lead to mental health issues being driven around constantly. And not only do you not get kids into school and families to access appropriate medical healthcare – for sometimes chronic and acute conditions – you don’t get the interaction and the integration which you’d get with a settled site.”Mr Willers said the injunction orders were rarely defended due to the broad definition of “persons unknown”, and fear among nomadic communities of coming forward to challenge them.He added: “Local authorities think it’s a swift and easy way of ensuring that they can move gypsies and travellers on, and they don’t need to go through a process of assessing the needs of inidual families. Our argument against that is that this is inhumane.“It’s a perfect storm for gypsies and travellers, and in the meantime some families are being moved from one borough to another, so those which are more humane in their treatment of gypsies and travellers tend to end up with more.”Woman set to become UK’s first Roma barrister on Brexit insecurityHelen Jones, chief executive of Leeds Gypsy and Traveller Exchange, said the injunctions meant all gypsies and travellers were being criminalised for the behaviour of a minority.“It’s to control the behaviour of a very small number of people who are doing industrial fly-tipping and antisocial behaviour. We don’t deal with the criminal behaviour but we punish them all,” she said.“When the first and only face you see from the state is\u0026nbsptelling you to shift it’s no wonder these groups\u0026nbspstart to feel really excluded. It’s pushed people out and made them very invisible, and our politicians are taking a stance of protecting local voters from these ‘hoards’.“It is social cleansing. It is driving certain groups out of areas and nomadism is a way of life. It turns an unauthorised encampment into a criminal offence – when all of that is an expression of unmet need.”Kate Green, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma, accused ministers of creating a “hostile policy” for nomadic groups by “ratcheting up” enforcement against travellers on unauthorised sites “without doing\u0026nbspmuch to address the supply side”.“If you want to ratchet up enforcement, you need to make sure people have access to legitimate sites, and we’re saying there’s a vast undersupply of such sites,” she said.“There’s an issue with funding. Local authority budgets are very squeezed, and that includes funding they could use to provide legitimate sites. The government’s response has been to talk up the enforcement side of the equation without doing very much to address the supply side.“We’ve had gypsy and Irish traveller families in this country for hundreds of years. It’s important that their needs are properly considered in public policy and adequately met. The tensions that exist are being exacerbated by failure of government to supply the sites that would enable them to live peacefully side by side.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators on Westminster Bridge in London for a protest called by Extinction Rebellion to raise awareness of the dangers posed by climate changeEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove speaking outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs offices.

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker.

This would\u0026nbsphave enormous water requirements in a nation already facing a national freshwater shortage.With a total spend of over £13,000, the two UK-backed projects were intended to export British expertise to kick-start proceedings and see pilot projects established in China within three years.Given the local opposition, legal troubles and environmental issues that have plagued British fracking, campaigners questioned the government’s involvement in operations overseas.“It is quite unbelievable that the UK should have the hubris to suggest that it can export a regulatory system that is clearly not fit for purpose,” said Barbara Richardson, a spokesperson from Frack Free Lancashire.Energy minister Claire Perry has emphasised the importance of shale gas as a relatively clean “bridge fuel” that will allow the transition to a low carbon economy, but critics are dubious about this goal.“With fracking and any other form of fossil gas, there is a huge risk of lock-in – which means that it won’t get up and running fast enough, and when investors are putting money into these operations they are putting it in for 40 or 50 years,” said Ms Markova.“In 40 years’ time we should not be using any fossil fuels whatsoever.”To meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, she concluded that the UK must stop financing any more fossil fuel extraction in foreign countries.Rose Dickinson from Friends of the Earth, who collaborated with Platform and Christian Aid to produce the report, said: “Our government’s claim to be climate leaders cannot be taken seriously while it continues to push fracking at home and abroad.“We need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not showing other countries the best way to dig up more.”Responding to the report, a spokesperson from\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspForeign and\u0026nbspCommonwealth Office said:\u0026nbsp“The UK’s aid investment is creating a safer, healthier and more prosperous world and is in the UK’s interest.“Gas has the potential to be a reliable energy source as countries transition towards a clean energy future, and these programmes are aimed at sharing UK expertise to help ensure that their exploration or development of resources like natural gas is done to high environmental standards.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s the future relationship that actually says this is the right deal for the future for our country.”isn’t going to make the negotiations any easier’The prime minister did repeat the government mantra that “nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed”, but then immediately\u0026nbspdrew a distinction between the controversial withdrawal agreement and the future relations – again pointing to the latter as the area which\u0026nbspwill be important for the government in delivering a favourable Brexit.Ms May’s focus will ring alarm bells with Brexiteers who want key elements of the withdrawal agreement re-written, including a number of ministers in her\u0026nbspcabinet.Leave MP slams Brexit deal because UK will be left with \u0027no MEPs\u0027Moderate Tories warn anti-EU \u0027purists\u0027 they could turn against BrexitMars bars could run out in ‘weeks’ in the event of a no-deal BrexitIt emerged earlier this week that a group of ministers including Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling are trying to secure changes to Ms May’s strategy, and even a rewrite of the draft withdrawal agreement – with some said to have held back from resigning in an effort to do so.But Downing Street sources told The Independent: “There are very real concerns that if you go back and re-open the withdrawal agreement now, it will give Brussels a chance to unpick the things that we’ve locked in.Negotiators were deadlocked for almost the entire two years of Brexit talks over what happens to the Irish border if a new trading relationship has not yet been agreed by the UK and EU by the end of the transition period in December 2020.Under these circumstances Brussels’ position was that\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspat least should remain in the EU’s customs union until a trade deal is set in stone, in order to keep the border with the republic open, but Ms May wanted\u0026nbspa solution where the whole UK remains in a customs arrangement but for a time-limited period.Brexiteers said they would only accept such a backstop arrangement if the UK can pull out of it unilaterally – something the EU has not agreed to -\u0026nbspand it is on this issue that the cabinet ministers will try to make a renewed push in the coming days.Asked about the arrangement, Ms May confirmed said it was a necessary “insurance policy” to assure the people of Northern Ireland there would be no border with the Republic.Asked directly whether the UK would be able to leave the backstop at will, Ms May said: “If you took out an insurance policy and if you were coming up to the point where that insurance policy was being used, and suddenly the people providing that insurance policy pulled the plug on it for you and you were left without that insurance policy, without having any say in it, what would you think?“Actually what we are talking about is a backstop we never intend to use, the EU don’t want to use it either, it’s not the only option on the table, were it to have to be used both sides can review it.”\u0026nbspRegarding a change of leadership, Ms May said it would bring more uncertainty for British\u0026nbspbusiness and people’s jobs\u0026nbspand would risk delaying negotiations and Brexit itself.She warned party rivals thinking of replacing her as Conservative leader that it also would not change the parliamentary arithmetic – which currently looks like no way forward would carry majority support.Pressed over what the government will do in the event a vote on the Brexit\u0026nbsp deal was lost in the commons, Ms May said: “There’s a process that parliament\u0026nbspwill go through, were it the case that the deal was lost then the government\u0026nbspwould come back with their proposals for what the next step was.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

His concerns come as senior academics say a no deal scenario with the EU is now the best option available for the UK at this late stage. Mr Paterson, a former environment and Northern Ireland secretary, has warned that the PM\u0027s deal is so bad it cannot possibly proceed.                \u0027Trump READY for trade deal\u0027 claims David Davis                 The PM\u0026rsquos deal would block free trade with the US, says Owen PatersonHe said Mrs May\u0027s much-criticised backstop of staying in the customs union and keeping Northern Ireland in the EU\u0027s single market could end up being permanent and would be governed by the EU\u0027s European Court of Justice.He said: In Washington last week, I discussed the deal with senior US trade representatives. There was real enthusiasm for a USUK trade deal but they were categorical that this would be impossible if the UK does not control its own tariff schedules or regulatory environment. That is exactly the fate which awaits us under the Prime Minister\u0027s current plans.Many British luxury brands are popular in the US with Rolls-Royce, which is made here, last year selling almost 2,000 cars, despite the lack of a trade deal. Clothing brands Next, Asos, Lipsy London, Rokit and Sweaty Betty also boast strong sales due to the UK\u0027s reputation for quality.Mr Paterson said that Mrs May should not simply stick to what she has secured from the EU.He added: Her best option is to change course and negotiate a wideranging, zero-tariff trade agreement, with solutions to the Northern Ireland border based on existing techniques and processes. Otherwise, she risks failing to honour the largest democratic mandate the British people have ever delivered.Meanwhile, Professor David Paton, chair of industrial economics at Nottingham University Business School, has said poorer voters in Labour heartlands have the most to gain from a no deal with the EU.Owen Paterson (Image: Victoria Jones PA ArchivePA Images)The senior member of Economists for Free Trade and a long-standing Labour member, has said Labour MPs should back Tory Brexiteers in pushing through a no deal if the PM\u0027s plans are voted down.Prof Paton pointed out: In the first place, we would no longer be forced to erect huge barriers to trade with non-EU countries, something which forces up the price of food and clothing for hard-pressed consumers. We would be free to strike deals with fast-growing economies around the world and, crucially, we would be able to control economic policy for the benefit of our own workers, consumers and businesses, rather than having to do what works for the EU Commission.He added: Why should we wait until 2022 before the UK is given gracious permission by the EU to abolish VAT on female sanitary products?Professor Gwythian Prins (Image: CH)On the Briefings for Brexit website of pro-Brexit academics, Professor Gwythian Prins has warned that the EU is rapidly collapsing - with economic problems around the euro, its southern economies such as Italy struggling and concerns over Eastern Europe. He said: The Government should have moved away from the rapidly collapsing EU soon after the vote for Brexit two years ago.He also believes that Mrs May\u0027s proposed deal is the exact opposite of what people had voted for.He predicted: You cannot negotiate with the EU. We will now leave, to trade with the rest of the world on World Trade Organisation terms.\u0026nbspProfessor David Paton (Image: Youtube)However, the Department for International Trade has insisted that Mrs May\u0027s deal will deliver the ability to trade on services, and pacts with the US, Australia and New Zealand can be ratified next year.Services now account for 80 per cent of Britain\u0027s export wealth.A DIT spokesman said: The Prime Minister has been clear that once we leave the EU, we will have the ability to negotiate new free trade agreements with the rest of the world. We are already laying the groundwork for negotiations with the US, Australia and New Zealand, and we will set out our negotiating objectives before formal talks begin.Last month, the US Trade Representative notified Congress of the Administration\u0027s intention to start talks with the UK for an agreement once the UK has left on March 29.A DIT source confirmed: The US is getting ready to negotiate.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448922573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apprentice airline best episode years","story":"It split apart million years ago and, must confess, it had entirely escaped my notice before Wednesday night — when it became the fourth-worst ever suggestion for the name of an airline, behind Black Box, Crash Positions and Ryanair.Or it was until Sabrina, from team Collaborative, came up with something that was worse than all of them — Jet Pop Airlines — and added a little explosion in the logo, just to set passengers’ minds fully at rest.No one involved should beat themselves up over any of these decisions, though, as they helped create the best episode of The Apprentice in years.It probably needed to be, as well. I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot. You surely know it.Do not kid yourself no one is paying attention. The public has been sold a pup again and again. It has had enough.Come clean with Britain. This deal is not wholly without merit.

mccann parents meeting with scotland yard detectives to discuss two vital new leads","story":"Last week the Home Office confirmed they had provided the politan Police with another £, to chase a “final line of inquiry”.Scotland Yard have been applying for funds every six months to continue the inquiry - known as Operation Grange - that has cost £.million so far.In a sit-down meeting last week with the McCanns the Operation Grange team told them they had “two specic and active” lines of inquiry.A Whitehall source told the Daily Mail: “politan Police officers had a sit-down meeting with Madeleines parents to tell them exactly where they were with their inquiries.“They informed them they had two specic and active leads that still needed to be chased and that although the investigation was taking longer than they initially thought officers said they were confident and hopeful they could get a result.”A senior Government source added: “Police seeking special grant funding have needed to justy exactly what the money would be spent on, who they are chasing and why.“They have had to outline their intended work in full detail and careful consideration has been given but we cannot ulge any aspects of that while there is an ongoing operation.”Madeleine was three when she was last seen while on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May .Former GP Kate and heart doctor Gerry, both , from Rothley in Leicestershire, are “very encouraged” the politan Police could finally be closing in on Maddie’s kidnapper after eleven-and-a-half years.Family spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: “They are very encouraged that the Met Police still believe there is work left to be done in the search for their daughter and they remain incredibly grateful to the Home Office for providing an extra budget for the investigation.It is a boost the while family and gives them renewed hope that one day they may finally find out what happened to Madeleine.Devastated parents of other missing children slammed that decision and questioned why the McCanns were getting “priority treatment”.Paul Whinham, , from Wallsend in North Tyneside, has been searching for his -year-old son Michael for three years.Speaking to the Sun Online he said: “After a six month investigation the Chief Inspector of Northumbria Police told me ‘I’m sorry Paul there’s no more money to keep on going, the case is closed butyou want to declare your son dead it takes six years’.“If any new evidence comes to light,there’s any more sightings or anything, I was told to get in touch with them.”He added: “But then I find out yet another £, is going from the Home Office to the politan Police to keep Operation Grange going.“Even police have said there’s no other evidence, there’s nothing that’s come to light in  years. Why  Why are they keeping going  Why “Why is one family getting all this priority  There are , missing people in this country.”In a separate case Karen Downes, , said she felt “very angry” other children, including her daughter Charlene, were “simply being forgotten”.She told the Sun Online: “A child goes missing in the UK every three minutes. What about all those others who never come home again ”No trace has been found of Charlene, , since she was last seen in Blackpool on November ,  – despite huge publicity and a £, reward.Last year detectives finally released the only CCTV footage of her on the day she vanished - after it lay unnoticed on police shelves for  years.Two takeaway workers were acquitted of her murder in  after a trial heard her body was chopped up and had gone into kebabs.Karen added: If they are going to plough money into the search for Madeleine, then they should do the same for all the children who are missing.She didn’t even go missing in this country – it’s really a matter for the Portuguese police, and yet the money just keeps on rolling in for the search.”Ben Needham’s mum, Kerry, has previously criticised the cash given to the Maddie search, saying it “hurt her”.She said: As Bens mum Im not taking anything away from them. We havent had a fraction of that help.Operation Grange has been one of the longest, most high-profile and costly police investigations in history.Some  persons of interest have been examined and sightings of Madeleine — in Brazil, India, Morocco and Paraguay, on a German plane and in a New Zealand supermarket — assessed.Previously police confirmed they thought Maddie was snatched by a paedophile gang who may have smuggled her over the border or grabbed during a botched burglary at the holiday complex.They have also been keen to identy a woman in purple seen hanging around the holiday flat.The Portuguese investigation of Madeleines disappearance was criticised by the British authorities as being not fit for purpose.Scotland Yard began an investigative review into the disappearance in , on the orders of then-Prime Minister David Cameron.Not one piece of forensic evidence linked to the little girl has been found since she vanished.And despite trawling through thousands of tip-offs and potential sightings, police have not confirmed that a single one was her.A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed: “We have confirmed that Special Grant funding of £, will be provided to the politan Police Service for the six-month period to  March . This is an ongoing police investigation.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004495554113.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"esther mcvey cabinet meltdown brexit deal","story":"The ex-Pensions Secretary reportedly became hysterical as she slammed Theresa Mays Brexit plan.Ms McVey today denied that she lost her temper - and described Cabinet colleagues as feeble for getting alarmed by her behaviour.The MP for Tatton resigned on Thursday morning, slamming the PM over the proposed withdrawal agreement.During the crunch Cabinet meeting the day before, Ms McVey was the angriest minister - urging Mrs May to let those present take a formal vote on whether or not they back the deal.One Cabinet source told the Mail on Sunday: It was the most extraordinary meltdown Ive seen in Cabinet.I thought security would have to be called, because she seemed so hysterical and aggressive.Chief Whip Julian Smith ended up shouting at her to shut up, the minister added.Ms McVey today described the claims as hilarious and mocked ministers for overreacting.She said: Seems a bit of straight talking from me to ask Cabinet members to vote on the most important matter in a letime made them crumble!Makes you wonderthis is how feeble senior members have been in negotiations with the EU over our future After she demanded a vote on the deal, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill - Britains top civil servant - produced documents showing that a formal vote is impossible.Ms McVey was one of two Cabinet ministers to resign on Thursday, triggering a massive crisis for Mrs May.The PM is now fighting off an attempt to call a vote of no confidence in her leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"italy earthquake ravenna venice magnitude latest","story":"An estimated .million people have felt the tremors.The earthquake struck about  kilometres from the town of Ravenna.Witnesses and residents say they heard a roar and that furniture moved.One wrote to EMSC and said: I heard a roar.Another said: Very short and intense.One said: Just two seconds of trembling, lamps moving a minute and chair moved.Another added: For about  seconds the TV set and hanging lamp were visibly shaking, I was sitting on couch and could feel shaking like strongwaves.A . earthquake on the Ritcher scale is classied as a light earthquake.It is felt by most people and objects do move and fall as well as light sleepers will be woken up.Signicant damage is unlikely.The EMSC  is an independent organisation that provides real-time earthquake information.For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online, where we will bring you live updates as soon as they happen, before anyone .Like us on Facebook at www.facebook thesun, and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun, where we will bring you this story and all the rest of the top news and exclusives of the day.TheSun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see videoOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am not sure that message has ever landed.Both May and Raab are due to take their arguments on to television screens on Sunday morning.At the end of a long week for May which left her battered and bruised but still standing, she told her critics that their alternative plans for a Brexit deal would not solve the issue of the Ireland border and the backstop arrangement.She told the Daily Mail: People sayyou could only just do something slightly dferent, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.Some politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good.Last week saw the departure of Raab and work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, plus the launch of a high-profile insurrection on the backbenches to remove Mrs May from office.She responded by bringing former home secretary Amber Rudd, who quit over the Windrush scandal, back into Cabinet to replace McVey.Steve Barclay took over as Brexit Secretary but with a reduced role.Meanwhile Zac Goldsmith, the Richmond MP and failed Tory London mayoral candidate in , revealed he has joined those who have sent a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee of backbench MPs.Writing in the Sunday , Goldsmith said that under the PMs plan in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say.He added: Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to Remain.The withdrawal agreement we have been presented with is unacceptable to Leave and Remain voters alike.It has close to zero chance of making it through Parliament and with only five months remaining, we cannot afford to waste any more time on it.In a sign the Tory civil war over Brexit is not calming, Middle East minister Alistair Burt warned rebels the consensus that pro-EU MPs should reluctantly respect the  referendum result could break downshe is toppled.Burt, whose role spans the Foreign Office and Department for International Development, attacked a tweet by Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, in which the latter promoted a lawyers legal case against the agreement reached with Brussels.Burt wrote: Be very clear.

An exclusive ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror shows  per cent say she should stay in place until at least Brexit Day on March  next year. That’s two fingers to Tory Brexiteer leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s attempts to oust her. By an  point margin they say he’s wrong to do so. And only  per cent think he should replace her. There is a virtual tie among those who would like Mrs May to hold on to No after Brexit with  per cent in favour and  per cent against, but that rises to seven in ten of Tory voters.  The last thing  per cent of voters want is for the present crisis to trigger a General Election as Jeremy Corbyn would like. Only a quarter of those questioned would welcome one. But there is some comfort for the Labour leader as the unveiling of Mrs May’s Brexit deal last week means she’s dropped three points. Labour are unchanged on  per cent, Tories on  per cent, Lib Dems on nine per cent. UKIP have gone up two points to seven per cent. But evenit costs her votes Mrs May is determined to stick to her guns. A senior Whitehall source said: “We’ve reached peak deal. We know it’s not perfect. Trade-offs have had to be made. “But this is as good as any deal is going to get and no amount of time will change that.”  The  page withdrawal agreement means Britain could be tied to the EU for years to come as we try to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with Europe. It cannot happen overnight. Canada took nine years to get theirs and Switzerland thirteen years. Voters are not keen either on any of Mrs May’s possible replacements should there be a leadership election. Boris Johnson is favourite, but even he’s only backed by one in five voters, and just a quarter of Tories would like to see him in No. Six in ten would not. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt scores only ten points, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove eight. Chair of the Tory backbench  Committee Graham Brady is now thought to have received at least  of the  letters needed from Tory MPs to trigger a no confidence vote in the PM.  If she loses that then she must resign and make way for a new PM in a fast-tracked six week contest. If she wins, even by a majority of one, then under Tory rules she cannot be challenged again for a year. Mrs May can hardly call for a confidence vote, though she must secretly want one as it would take  Tory MPs to topple her and that is unlikely. But to be on the safe side Chief Whip Julian Smith has all his junior whips out in force twisting arms. A Tory official told the Sunday Mirror: “It’s sensible for us to prepare for this.” Our poll findings are a blow for the People’s Vote campaigning for a second referendum. The majority of voters do not want one with  per cent against and  per cent for. Andthere was a referendum the result would be too close to call with remainers narrowly ahead on  per cent and leavers on  per cent.

Mcvey, who resigned from the Government on Wednesday in protest at Theresa May’s Brexit deal – is reported to have been embroiled in a furious confrontation with the Prime Minister during the mammoth five-hour meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The former Work and Pensions Secretary demanded a vote to formally record Ministers’ positions on the deal, according to the Mail on Sunday who quote a senior figure present. Ms McVey has denied that she was in tears and told the paper: I’m made of much sterner stuff than that. But one Minister present told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It was the most extraordinary meltdown I’ve seen in Cabinet. I thought security would have to be called, because she seemed so hysterical and aggressive.  The Prime Minister tried to talk to her, but it was all just empty waffle which Esther talked over. So Julian [Smith, Chief Whip], just started shouting at her to shut up.’ The Mail also reports that Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill objected to Ms McVey’s call for a vote to put on record where everyone stood. Downing Street was left shaken by the resignations of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Ms Mcvey the day after the draft of the deal was made public.  But Michael Gove remained in post along with other Brexiteers such as Chris Grayling and Andrea Leadsom. In her resignation letter, Ms McVey said: The deal you put before the Cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum. Indeed, it doesn’t meet the tests you set from the outset of your Premiership. She added that the deal would prevent future governments from striking free trade deals and ‘threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom’. But May continues to back the deal and says it delivers on the result of the referendum.Although still in the Cabinet, Andrea Leadsom is said the leading a gang of five including Grayling, Penny Mourdaunt, Liam Fox and Michael Gove in a bid to re-write the deal.Ms McVey has been replaced at the DWP by former Amber Rudd, who resigned as Home Secretary after admitting she misled parliament regarding the Windrush scandal. However a subsequent review said she had been let down by officials.

Askedthis would happen immediately, he added: Well I think that the whole thing is written with the intention that it should be an expeditious process. I think one of the crazy things that has taken hold over the last few weeks is that people in the media and where are suggesting that this could be something that goes on for weeks, and it’s an entirely discretionary process for me. It’s not. The intention is clear thatit were to happen, it ought to be a test of opinion, very quickly, in order to clear the air and get it out of the way so that the party, the government at the moment, can move on. And he said the idea that he would sit on some letters to give the PM or the party, a moment to draw breath was untrue and offensive.

My grandma knitted me mittens to try to stop me scratching my eczema at night, but the urge to itch was uncontrollable. I’d wake up with my bandages ripped away, my skin bleeding. Why was this happening to me  By secondary school, confusion had turned to shame. I’d hide my hands because I didn’t want anyone to know my secret. ‘Take your gloves off, Camille!’ a teacher shouted across the classroom one day. The boy next to me stared at my weeping, raw skin. ‘Have you been cutting yourself ’ he asked. At sleepovers, my friends would play with fun beauty products, while I had ugly medicinal creams. Eczema made me feel isolated, painfully aware I was dferent. Winter was the worst. Sore, red, itchy patches flared up on my hands, inside my elbows and across my face. It felt like my body was burning and blistering up from the inside. My lips would swell so badly I could hardly speak and I’d beg my mum to let me stay off school.  Even strong steroid creams couldn’t put out the fire in my skin. Finding a cure was all I could think of. I had dreams, but felt I’d never fulfil them when I was trapped inside my own skin. Mum was a great believer in holistic treatments, and when I was  she arranged for allergy testing. I came away with a long list of foods I was intolerant to and a new optimism. Finally! All the answers were here on this page. I followed that list to the letter, avoiding all ‘problems’ from gluten and dairy, right down to lettuce. At last, I was in control, and my skin began to heal. It seemed like the miracle I’d dreamed of. What I didn’t see then was I’d swapped one problem for another. Instead of being controlled by eczema I was being controlled by my new regime, which was spiralling into an obsession. I’d rather skip a meal than eat the wrong things. Soon I was existing on juices, and although I was exhausted and my weight was in free-fall, I was convinced I was being healthy. But I was running on empty and it was only a matter of time before the ticking time bomb of eczema exploded again. Going to university was the detonator. On top of the tiredness from hardly eating, I was partying and drinking, and by the end of Freshers Week my eczema was back.  It was soul-destroying after I’d fought so hard to keep it away. It was a big part of the reason I quit my course five months later. For a while, my le followed a pattern. I’d be stressed, and my eczema would take over. However,I took myself away from the source of unhappiness my skin would calm down. After that disastrous first go at university, I switched to a study year abroad in Calornia. The combination of sunshine, good friends and healthy living left my skin glowing again. It didn’t last. I came home to start a marketing internship, and what I thought would be the start of my dream career turned into a nightmare. I was out of my depth and shattered by a three-hour round commute. My eczema flared up, worse than ever. I couldn’t drive to work until my then-boyfriend had wrapped me in bandages to stop my oozing, bleeding skin sticking to my clothes. At my interview, I’d talked passionately about my healthy lestyle, yet here I was, a mess. I was told to take time off to recover, but while I was away an email pinged in. I wasn’t the person I’d sold myself as, and they didn’t want me back. I hit rock bottom. Eczema had cost me my internship, and there seemed no way out. One night I was sitting in bed, desperately Googling for eczema success stories, but all I found was negativity. Suddenly, I felt a rush of heat from my toes to my head, and my head was throbbing and swelling.  There wasn’t a single piece of skin that wasn’t burning – my whole body was consumed. When I looked in the mirror, I didn’t recognise the puffy face staring back, and I was so horried I burst into tears. I felt so ill I was frightened I was dying. I was rushed to AE, where blood tests showed my immune system was inflamed and my eczema was badly infected. Beyond that, the doctors had no answers. ‘Sorry, but you’re  and you won’t grow out of your eczema,’ one said. ‘Your best option is oral steroids plus anti-depressants.’ At that point, I’d lost all hope. Thank God Mum was there to pick me back up. ‘You’re an amazing person, Camille,’ she said. ‘You need to focus on who you want to be once you get better.’ So I did. Mum and I wrote a plan. ‘I want to inspire people,’ I said. ‘If I can control my eczema, I’d like to help others.’ First, I had to heal myself. Mum convinced me to try neuro-linguistic programming, which is all about shting your mindset. I thought, ‘This is silly, my eczema is a physical problem, it’s not in my head.’ But after just one session I had my first proper night’s sleep in ages. It made me realise how closely linked my mind and skin are. That’s the moment my eczema truly started to heal. I started making gratitude lists, which sounds wacky but made a huge dference. It’s easy to dwell on the curveballs le throws us, but looking for the positives helps calm the mind and body. I focused on things I was passionate about. I saved up to train as a health coach and natural chef, and the happiness showed in my skin.  I surrounded myself with people who loved me. I also had nutritional tests, which showed I was low in the healing mineral, zinc. I thinkI hadn’t discovered that, I’d have been ill for a very long time. With my own skin under control, I began coaching other people with eczema. It’s been so rewarding, hearing people say I’ve changed their le. Now I’ve poured everything I’ve learned into a book and website, so I can help as many people as possible. I’ll never say my eczema is cured, but I live a le beyond it. I have the occasional flare-up, but I have the tools to control it. Today I truly love my eczema and see the beauty in it. It’s become a friend that shows me when I’m unhappy and guides me onto the right path. Eczema has made me the person I am today.  Camilles H.O.P.E. principles Camille’s programme is centred around four key elements that helped heal her eczema, all aimed at lowering stress. Uncontrolled stress, she says, is a key cause of flare-ups, as it hits the immune system hard.  Home: Make your environment healthier by decluttering , getting enough sleep and practising mindful meditation.  Optimism: You didn’t choose to have eczema, but you can choose how you respond to it. Focus on the positives, reframe the negatives, create a support network, and use affirmations and gratitude lists.  Purpose: Find meaning by doing what you love, from work to family le.

Instead, she embarked on a new stage of her career, working as a nurse in some of the world’s most dangerous places. After decades working in busy London hospitals and in war zones like Iraq as part of the Territorial Army , she knew she had skills that were desperately needed and had always liked the idea of working for MSF – Medecins Sans Frontier Doctors without Borders, a charity that sends medics to far-flung locations where help is needed most. ‘You see all these terrible images on TV and you think, “I’m sure I could do something to help, evenit’s not very much. I’m sure I could make a dference,”’ says Diane. ‘It was something I’d often thought of doing, but now I found myself without a marriage or mortgage, and I knew I really could this time. My family and friends thought I was a little mad, but they knew better than to interfere.’Diane left her job at the Royal Free Hospital in London aged , and worked shts at her local AE in Welwyn Garden City while she studied for the Diploma in Tropical Nursing she’d need to work for MSF. Five months later, she qualied and accepted a mission to the mountains of Papua New Guinea – the world’s most dangerous country that isn’t at war because there are frequent violent clashes between the  tribes, each of which speak a dferent language. Diane was going to be working in the heart of the country’s most volatile region.  ‘I had to hit the ground running,’ she says. ‘The previous nurse had already left, so there was no handover and I made do with handwritten notes she’d left me. The injuries we’d see were relentless – many of the men carry bush knives and they use them on a regular basis. Every other night I’d find myself preparing people for surgery who had been attacked with the machetes or shot with homemade guns or bows and arrows.’ It was a far cry from the sorts of hospitals she’d worked at in London. The  MSF medics from around the world formed a tight bond, living together in two houses inside the walls of the hospital complex. Security was tight – each morning they were allowed out for a walk or a run, but other than that they stuck to the safety of the compound. Sexual abuse was re, and the hospital had a dedicated unit to treat victims. ‘Domestic and sexual violence are all rolled into one, and are so much a part of everyday le there. Women often come off the worst in troubled times. Our unit had beds where women could stay just to be away from the violence for a while, and we trained local counsellors to try and give them tools to cope.’There was also a maternity unit which sometimes called on Diane for assistance. ‘I’d worked as a midwe many years before, and the obstetrician helped me brush up on my skills,’ remembers Diane. One night when the obstetrician was away, a patient had a very dficult delivery. ‘The baby was completely stuck, and I just couldn’t get it out. I went to the surgeon, who was in theatre and scrubbed up, and he calmly told me that I had to keep trying. Eventually I managed to deliver the baby – it was the most incredible feeling and the mum was very grateful. There were about three or four baby Dianes named after me on that mission –I a go back there, I’ll have to find my little Dianes!’ After nine months, Diane ed to the UK, but she knew even as the plane touched down that her work with MSF wasn’t done. She signed up for another mission, and three months later she headed to South Sudan, where tens of thousands of people had been displaced by the civil war.  Diane lived in a hut with a thatched roof and outdoor latrines full of snakes and spiders. The hospital was rustic and the maternity ward had very little in the way of equipment. ‘We saw many, many babies born weighing just one or two kilos because their mothers were so malnourished,’ says Diane. ‘There were no incubators, so kangaroo mother care – where you put the baby to the skin of the mother and you wrap them up – was all we had. Many mothers were reluctant with this unfamiliar technique, but we had a French paediatrician called David Drummond who’d go into the ward every day and joke and laugh with the women. After a while, a few of them started doing the kangaroo care, and once the others saw how their babies were thriving, they all did it – it just goes to show that one doctor can make a huge dference.’Diane has now done seven missions in as many years, caring for people everywhere from Yemen to Syria. One Christmas Eve, she received an urgent phone call from MSF askingshe could fly back to South Sudan to help with an emergency, and she was on a plane by Boxing Day. Fighting had become so dangerous around the Red Cross hospital that the staff had fled. There were two surgeons, two anaesthetists and two nurses to treat  severely sick and injured patients. With no cleaners left, the hospital was filthy and the MSF team were left in almost impossible conditions. One nurse prepared the patients for major surgeries like amputations, while the other administered antibiotics and fluid IVs to the other patients. The fighting outside the hospital was so extreme that the medical team was only allowed to stay inside the building until .pm each day. ‘It was very dficult to leave people behind, knowing they may not survive the night,’ says Diane. ‘You could try to be the hero and stay, butyou were killed it wouldn’t help anyone at all.So each morning we’d , andpeople had survived, we’d start administering care all over again, andthey hadn’t, then their families would have taken them away in the night. It was really hard.’  MSF offers counselling for their medics after a mission, but it’s not something Diane has had, preferring instead to talk through any traumatic incidents with her colleagues. But there have been some particularly tough occasions that have stayed with her, such as the time in South Sudan when a boat-full of battle casualties was dumped outside the hospital in the middle of the night. ‘It was like nothing I’d ever experienced –  injured people in need of emergency care,’ she recalls. ‘All hands were on deck, including the people who worked in admin or finance at the hospital. I rushed from patient to patient, trying to work out who needed the most urgent care as the finance girl took triage notes for me. There was no time to be afraid we were running on pure adrenaline.’ But there have also been some overwhelmingly good times, such as watching children come back from the brink of death. There is also the camaraderie between the team that makes it feel a bit more bearable. ‘I remember once, over dinner, admitting that it was my birthday that day. Two French girls went into the kitchen, spread some digestive biscuits with Nutella and brought it out with a little candle. I just thought that was the best birthday cake I’d ever had.’ This month Diane turns , she keeps fit by rowing and playing tennis, and is planning one more mission to Gaza before the year is out. ‘There were definitely points during my MSF career where I thought, “What am I doing  I should be at home having a cosy retirement,” but I like to be useful and make a dference. ‘If there’s one thing my time with MSF has really taught me, it’s just how under-appreciated the NHS really is. When people say it’s like Third World healthcare  Trust me, it really, really isn’t.’ To donate to MSF, go to msf.org.uk , or visit Diane’s JustGiving page, Justgiving fundraising Diane-Robertson-bell.

Law student Elizabeth Wilkins, , was attacked during her trial on charges of child cruelty, which she denied. However having been found guilty Wilkins, who once worked as a pound-an-hour escort, faces years in jail for leaving her son fighting for his le. She fractured her baby’s skull and broke his ribs by squeezing and shaking him and banging his head against a hard surface in rage and frustration, reports Plymouth Live. The child, only three months old at the time of the attacks two years ago suffered brain damage. Wilkins was attacked outside Plymouth Crown Court during a lunchbreak as she gave evidence.  A judge called the assault “outrageous”, but Wilkins carried on from the witness stand after lunch with no visible injury. Claire Moore, aged , was dragged before city magistrates where she admitted assaulting Wilkins by beating – the lowest type of assault. Moore, of Greenbank, was fined pound, ordered to pay pound victim surcharge and pound compensation to Wilkins. The exact nature of the assault is not known but Plymouth Live understands the former University of Plymouth student was verbally abused and then manhandled in September . Trial Judge Peter Johnson told the jury shortly after the attack in the third week of the trial: “I am aware that at least one of you saw an incident at lunchtime, an appalling assault on Elizabeth Wilkins. “I think all of you are now aware of this outrageous act committed I think by a woman in drink against someone in the middle of their evidence.” He commended her barrister Piers Norsworthy for stepping in to help his client outside the court – an area popular with street-drinkers. Callous Wilkins tried to sht the blame on her former partner and co-defendant -year-old Erick Vanselow.  He was cleared of failing to protect their son – having earlier been acquitted of assault. Judge Peter Johnson adjourned sentencing for psychiatric and probation reports. He granted her bail but banned her from contact with her son. Wilkins is due to be sentenced on December . Wilkins denied assaulting her child causing grievous bodily harm with intent on September , . That was the day the boy’s head was smashed against a hard surface in the flat the parents once shared in College Avenue in Mutley. She also pleaded not guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm between August  and September  in .  Her trial would have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. A jury unanimously found her guilty on both counts after seven hours of deliberations. The exact events which ended in the boy, who cannot be named by court order, in hospital will never be known. The jury found that Wilkins attacked her son several times, fracturing his ribs and then pointing the finger of suspicion at Mr Vanselow. She finally banged his head against a heavy object while she was alone in the flat for  minutes on September , . Wilkins said nothing of what happened and the parents only took him to the GP – who immediately phoned for an ambulance.

Noah has suffered two cardiac arrests, more than  blood transfusions, undergone heart surgery and overcome more than eight infections in his tiny  day le. He also had bleeds on the brain, acute renal failure and five lumbar punctures - but dad Paul Gleeson said these were only a few of the procedures the brave little boy managed to pull through. Paul, , and we Emmas ordeal began when she started bleeding in July this year, reports the Liverpool Echo. Emma, , rushed to hospital and was told she would have to deliver him just short of  weeks early.  Doctors at Liverpool Womens Hospital had tried a number of procedures to delay labour, but they soon realised delivering Noah early was the only option. Paul said: It was scary. We then had to make decisions about what our wishes werethings went wrong in labour with Noah. We had to make this decision quick. We were told a c section would cause a high risk to Emma and not benefit Noah. We told themhe needed resuscitating to try everything they could but then we did not want Noah to be put through anything that was not beneficial for him. After Emma gave birth we thought things were going to be OK as doctors showed us Noah so for the first time we relaxed. But then they said to come through and say goodbye.  I went through and there were doctors working on Noah at the same time. He had been taken into intensive care and was in an incubator which had steamed up due to the ventilator pumping fast air into the baby. It wasnt nice to see any baby like that never mind your own. The doctors were amazing with us and Noah. They did everything they could, even helping us to get him baptised that night. After this I went back into our room and we were just devastated, Noah was our first child, he was our dream and we were devatasted. Thankfully, Noah exceeded doctors expectations and survived his first night, and his second, his third and so on. After being born on July ,  Noah remained in hospital for  days.  Paul listed all the things his son went through during this time, including two cardiac arrests, a double resuscitation, more than  blood transfusions, more than eight infections and heart surgery. He also said he had bleeds on the brain, acute renal failure, five lumbar punctures - but he admitted this list is only what he could remember after their rollercoaster journey. Paul added: It seems short listing it like that, but experiencing it was very dficult. During the first month, there was a worry Noah just wouldn’t make it. At one point he was on the max of every medication he could be on and was just stable. Should he have become unstable, we would have had to have a dferent conversation about making him comfortable. However Noah being a fighter, never gave up.  Every time a nurse went off sht you could tell they didnt expect to see him again. It was two weeks after he was born we got our first bit of hope as Noah made the smallest bit of progress. It was strange because once we got this first bit of hope then everyday we were getting a bit more good news. It was three weeks before we could hold him, which was dficult. Because of all the tubes it was a two nurse job to get him out of the incubator. They always said on the unit that it is a rollercoaster journey and that is what it was. After battling against the odds, Noah was finally allowed home on November  - the date he was due to born. Paul added: Hes amazing. We are very lucky that he has came through with very little problems.  He came home on a tube of oxygen and we need to be extra careful over the winter months ashe gets a common cold it get put him back in hospital. He has Chronic Lung Disease but doctors believe he should outgrow this as he gets older. When he was in hospital our family moved baby stuff we had bought out of our house in case he never made it. So its been nice being home and being able to get it back and start doing the baby room. Before we left even the doctors and nurses who had treated Noah were surprised how well he has done. We have so much appreciation and thanks to the Liverpool Womens Hospital and the Neonatal unit, the nurses and the doctors on the unit do amazing work for all the babies whilst supporting us parents too during what is the most dficult time for any parent. Without their love, care and support Noah would not be here for anyone to show any interest. Paul and Emma decided to set up an Instagram account documenting Noahs journey in a bid to help others in a similar situation. Speaking about their decision Paul said: We originally created Noah’s Instagram account so we could update friends and family on his journey. We found lots of people messaging us for updates which was upsetting especially in the early days, so we thought we would do this to document his journey and share with our family and friends. It soon grew to friends of friends and everyone was interested and hoping for the best for Noah. Our thoughts with it now is to continue to update Noah’s journey and development now he’s home and more importantly hopefully provide hope and comfort to other premature parents who, like us, would be frightened and unsure. We found similar hope in a private Facebook group for parents of the NICU unit. Our story is a happy one in that we got to take Noah home. However there are many parents who aren’t as lucky as us. It’s a real dficult journey andthis can bring a smile to people and give parents hope that no matter how bleak, there is always hope we will be very happy. You can follow Noahs journey on Instagram @noah_gleeson. A JustGiving page has also been set-up to raise money for Liverpool Womens Hospital and Neonatal Unit.

Samantha was tight-lipped on the specics of the book but its contents are believed to centre on the family row that ripped through the Markles since Meghans engagement and dramas before and after her wedding in May. Samantha told The Daily Star: “In The Shadows Of The Duchess covers everything… the world does not know truth total truth…holding nothing back! “From lullabies to lies..it’s all they’re in my book.  “The book covers everything that goes on behind the scenes that the world does not know and trust me there is a lot.” The book was previously titled “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister”.

The -year-old Duchess of Sussex - branded Hurricane Meghan by royal aides because of her work ethic - has reportedly raised eyebrows with her choice of outfits since her wedding. Although she is said to have a good relationship with the Queen, her dress sense hasnt always been met with approval. According to the Mail on Sunday, the monarch was surprised when Meghan opted to wear the elegant white Givenchy dress for her May wedding, given she had been married before. And her decision not to wear a hat on a royal visit alongside the Queen in Cheshire in June raised eyebrows - because protocol dictates she should have followed suit when told the monarch would don one.  This is said to have caused a level of tension between the two on the trip, as the Queen is described as a stickler for the rules. A fashion team source said: Meghan is being told she needs to start dressing less like a Hollywood star and more like a Royal. In her first royal engagement after getting married on May , many commented on how she appeared to have altered her style to be more fitting with the royals . But just a few months later she was back to her more usual style - showing bare legs in shorter styles, not entirely keeping with royal protol.  She wore a black suit, with the skirt above the knee, when she attended a special performance of the musical Hamilton in August. And her fondness for wearing black may not be entirely popular, as royals traditionally only wear the colour when in mourning. She is also a fan of non-British designers, which suggests she is breaking the mould. According to a royal source Meghan is up at am rain or shine and her formidable work ethic is like something that palace staff have never experienced before.

Gemma Bray, , goes by the name The Organised Mum and has devised a method for getting all the cleaning done in half an hour a day between Monday and Friday. After making a rota for herself to help her keep on top of the housework when she had her first child  years ago, The Organised Mum Methodis now religiously followed by parents across the country. Gemma was even invited onto Good Morning Britain to talk about it. Gemma, who is now a mum of three, told the Manchester Evening News : I started the method  years ago after my eldest child was born. I was struggling to keep on top of everything in the house and look after a newborn, so I created the method which enabled me to get everything done but still have lots of time leftover to enjoy my new baby.I sat at my kitchen table and drew it up on a piece of paper and stuck it to my fridge, and I have followed it ever since. Essentially, TOMM is an efficient way to keep on top of everything at home. We work in  minute chunks daily Monday to Friday. Weekends are kept housework free so you can enjoy your time off without having to do a mammoth clean at the weekend. Each day has its own focus room, and these never change.The pattern goes: Monday - living room Tuesday - bedrooms Wednesday - hallway and stairs Thurs - kitchen Fridays - focusing on a dferent area each week in an eight-week cycleThe Friday Focus room alternates each week and gets a deep clean, the idea being that it eliminates the need for spring cleans and makes sure your house just keeps on getting cleaner. Now living in Kent, Gemma is originally from Altrincham in Greater Manchester where she worked in her familys fish and chip shops. Before having children she owned chip shops herself in Suffolk, and it was while still working  days there that she first started TOMM - doing  minutes in the morning and  minutes at night.  Its taken off so much that it recently became her job, with revenue from sponsorship and collaborations with brands so that she can keep her method free for people to download. She said: I never really expected it to take off. In fact, I followed TOMM privately for years and it was only a couple of years ago, one New Years Eve, when my kids dared me to start an Instagram page all about it. I took them up on their dare. It really struck a chord and people started to share the method and it really gained traction quickly. I first noticed it was starting to make some waves last Christmas, when I was asked to go on Good Morning Britain to talk about it. Gemma, who is married to Mike, , and mum to Tom, , Jonny, nine, and three-year-old Ben, puts part of the success down to the team spirit that comes with TOMM. She said: Not many people enjoy cleaning but unfortunately we have to do it. I try my best to make cleaning fun, I put together daily Spoty playlists for people to rock the housework to and the sense of community that people feel when they know that thousands of others are cleaning their living room at the same time is amazing. I think so many people have joined Team TOMM because it gives them motivation to keep on top of the housework without having to be cleaning for hours every day. The team spirit is amazing and on the Team TOMM Facebook group we have such a strong sense of community - we currently have , members. If someone is having a bad day or needs cleaning tips everyone rallies round. It is actually lovely to see. And its not just mums who are on board with Gemmas plan. TOMM promotes a balanced approach to keeping on top of it all, which means it is achievable for busy people, she said. Sht workers, busy parents, non-parents can all follow the method - plus, it is completely free to download.

There is no appetite either for a second referendum. Andthere was one, our findings suggest the result would be too close to call. A narrow Remain win would not settle the issue and would destroy Leavers’ faith in democracy. Mr Rees-Mogg should also take note that only a quarter of those questioned would favour a General Election as a response to the mess the Tories have landed us in. There is a time for a General Election to sweep the Tories from power. But that time is not now.  Tragic mistake If the Tories could tear themselves away from Brexit, they might consider the despair their methods are causing ordinary people. A pincer movement by the NHS, the DWP and a local authority drove Penny Oliver to kill herself with the very drugs which got her into a spiral of debt. What started as a small repayment of pound soared as penalty fees and surcharges were swtly slapped on. And Penny could not cope.  Of course the NHS needs to police free prescriptions. Of course it must check whether patients are entitled to claim them. But Penny’s only crime was to make an honest mistake. And then she was disgracefully hounded for money she did not have.

And alongside her publicised engagements, Meghan has been conducting a series of ‘undercover’ missions to meet the British people, particularly those associated with good causes. It may be this seismic change that has led to the flurry of change in royal staff over the past few month. Just a few days ago it emerged that Meghans personal assistant has resigned just six months into the job. The aide, identied only as Melissa, is believed to have quit suddenly, shortly after Meghan married into the Royal Family in May.  She will soon be joined by the royal couples private secretary Samantha Cohen, who is set to leave in Spring , and follows Harrys right hand man Edward Lane Fox out of the palace door. Senior communications secretary Katrina McKeever – a point of liaison for Meghan’s family – also quietly left the Kensington Palace press office in September. Some who remain, meanwhile, conduct themselves in ways that might seem unorthodox, with Meghan’s private assistant secretary filmed appearing to shove a photographer away from her boss on the recent Australia tour.  In her first royal engagement after getting married on May  many commented on how she appeared to have altered her style to be more fitting with the royals . But just a few months later she was back to her more usual style - showing bare legs in shorter styles, not entirely keeping with royal protol. Since, a source from one of the fashion teams which has visited Kensington Palace told The Mail on Sunday: Meghan is being told she needs to start dressing less like a Hollywood star and more like a Royal.

Fuming Councillor Steve Munby, who had the van removed after complaints from staff, told the Liverpool Echo he feared the agency was targeted mums.He said: They are trying to recruit people and we are worried about that.

The -year-old mirror is believed to be possessed once a year by Edward John Smith, who left it on the dressing table of his home in Stoke-on-Trent before he set sail on the ill-fated ships infamous maiden voyage. A servant of the captain, Ethelwynne, was offered to take one item from his home when he went down with the ship after the vessel hit an iceberg on April ,  as a keepsake and in lieu of wages. But the terried maid told relatives she could still see Captain Smiths face in the silver-framed easel mirror each year on the anniversary of when the Titanic sank. Since then, the haunted mirror was passed down by Ethelwynnes relatives and was later discovered in a deceased estate in Wolverhampton before coming into possession of current owner David Smith, who kept it in a vault for the last five years.  The letter, penned by Ethelwynnes sister-in-law Hilda and addressed to someone called Ida, chillingly reads: She [Ethelwynne] always spooked me when she said that at times she could still see Captain Smiths face in it on the anniversary of when the Titanic was sunk. Auctioneer Richard Winterton said: The last time Captain Edward John Smith saw his own noble, bearded visage before leaving home to take the helm of the Titanic was possibly in this very mirror. Even with ones feet firmly on land and in the sunshine of a clear afternoon, there is something otherworldly about seeing your own reflection in such an object.  Captain Smith must have surveyed his own image in this mirror countless times and the legend that his face can still be seen in it on each anniversary of the Titanics sinking is as compelling as it is chilling! Whoever buys this in December will have it in good time to test that legend for themselves on the th anniversary next April. The mirror is expected to fetch more than pound, from collectors when it goes up for auction in Lichfield, Staffs, with Richard Winterton Auctioneers this December.  Included with the mirror is a small brown envelope containing the handwritten note and explaining the items provenance. A statue of Smith was unveiled in Lichfields Beacon Park in July , with the cathedral city chosen as the location due to Lichfields status as the centre of Staffordshires diocese. The plaque on the memorial statue commemorates Smiths great heart, a brave le and a heroic death, adding in quotes Be British - a reference to Smiths stf upper-lip in the face of impossible adversity and what were widely believed to be - yet unsubstantiated as - his final words.  Bargain Hunt and Dickinsons Real Deal star Richard added: Interest in the Titanic is as strong as ever. This mirror could fetch well in excess of pound, at auction. Last month, a couple was left terried after the ghost of the captain of the Titanic photobombed them in a historic pub with connections to the doomed ship. Cheryl, , and Luke Arkless, , hit the headlines after they visited Belfasts Robinsons pub and snapped a romantic shot together they were horried to spot a spooky face right behind them - which they believe bears a great resemblance to Captain Smith.

When you get down to it, you might soon discover that what works for you, doesnt feel so good for your partner and vice versa. And when it comes to pleasing the ladies, recent research has shown that up to  percent of women have dficulty reaching climax, while for others the Big O is achievable but is likely to be short and sweet. However scientists think they may have stumbled across a new trick that will lead to longer and better orgasms for women. Yay!  So whats the secret to increasing theof an orgasm  Surprisingly its actually really simple - all you have to do is add a sex toy into the mix. According to bodyandsoul, sex toy retailer Lovehoney discovered this little gem of information after commissioning a study into the science of sex. The aim of the racy study was to find out what really happenswhen a woman approaches orgasm with a sex toy, and without one.  And the results clearly found that a woman can orgasm faster and for  percent longer on average when shes using a sex toy. The brain patterns of  women were analysed by neuroscientists as they climaxed and they saw that the womens Alpha brainwave levels dramatically increased when a sex toy Lovehoneys new Happy Rabbit range was used. Dr Nicole Prause, who was leading the study, said: Our original hypothesis was that the Happy Rabbit would bring women to orgasm quicker than manual masturbation. However we found that women wanted to play, explore and enjoy their new toy, which resulted in a longer lasting sexual experience with broader physical sensations and more excitement than using their hand alone.

How you come back from that type of injury is normally how much you put into your rehab.“Mark has given absolutely everything. He is out running, he is out doing the warm-ups with the other players.“Mark is out running with physios when we are training. It is great to see him with his boots on and getting that step closer.“There might be some set-backs along the way with that type of injury but it is all systems go. Mark has been fantastic and the physios could not be more pleased with him.”Reynolds limped off just  minutes into the friendly with Cove Rangers. A scan revealed the extent of the damage and he subsequently underwent surgery in Glasgow.That friendly was abandoned as Cove’s Jordon Brown, , suffered a serious head injury in an accidental collision with Dons defender Considine in the second half.An ambulance was called, with spectators asked to leave, and Brown received treatment for more than  minutes.The ex-Aberdeen youngster has gone on to make regular appearances for Cove this season.“If Mark gets close round about January, in the winter break, to coming back then he has done extremely well,” said McInnes.“It can be a seven to eight-month injury.“Considering he did it in July, as good as Mark is doing and encouraged as we are, we still have to be careful.“It is a serious injury and we have to treat it that way.”Reynolds’ serious knee problem was the first set-back in what would become an injury crisis for Aberdeen in the early throes of this season. At one point, McInnes had eight players out injured.Reynolds and on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, are the only two long-term absentees for the Dons now.Aberdeen are to assess the extent of the injury to Devlin that forced him tofrom the Scotland squad.McInnes said: “We did not have our troubles to seek with injuries. It was the worst injury situation since I have been at Aberdeen.“With Mark, he had done all the pre-season work so to then get injured in a pre-season game sticks in the throat a wee bit.“But that is the nature of the game and with injuries you can never foresee when they come.“Thankfully we have dealt with them as a squad and Mark is dealing with his injury.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity walk for kids cause","story":"A dog-walking group is hoping to break its own record with a charity event.Bella and Co, a socialisation group based in the north-east, is raising money for charity Cash for Kids Mission Christmas appeal.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

general inspection since .MP John Lamont believes the figures show the Scottish Government is failing Borders pupils.He said: ldquoParents in the Borders will find it shocking that one in five schools have been waiting more than a decade for an assessment by Education Scotland.\"While I understand that inspections can be stressful for teachers, they need to be taking place more regularly than they are.\"Inspections are vital for parents to make an informed choice about their childrsquos education.\"Many young families look at these reports before a potential move and with so many out of date in the Borders, it can only be putting people off.\"But our hard-working teachers are also being let down because inspections provide important feedback and advice.\"Among the  local schools which havent been fully inspected in the past decade are Hawick High School , Priorsford Primary , Stow Primary , Walkerburn Primary , Broomlands Primary , Fountainhall Primary , Jedburgh Grammar Schooland Eyemouth High .Its also been nine years since Berwickshire High was inspected, eight years since Earlston High, seven years since either Peebles High or Kelso High were visited and five years since Galashiels Academy was graded.One of the s of the national agency, Education Scotland is to evaluate the quality of learning and teaching in schools.And inspections were meant to take place more regularly after the agency was criticised last year.Mr Lamont MP added: \"Education is meant to be the Scottish Governmentrsquos number one priority, so you would think there would be enough resources dedicated to be able to inspect our schools more regularly.ldquoAt this rate, it would take Education Scotland more than  years to get round each school in the Scottish Borders and that suggests to me

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks.

First DivisionAlex McKinvenWhen last did the Pupils score five goals at home and eventually manage to lose the match The simple answer to the question is never.Readers will be rubbing their eyes in disbelief, but the self destruct button was firmly pushed last Saturday and the home side weren’t alone in a gt strewn afternoon.Both teams seemed determined to outdo one another in a goal fest of biblical proportions.As both sets of coaches closed their eyes in horror, a sizable crowd was entertained as both nets rippled and bulged at regular intervals.With only four league games on it was the perfect opportunity for the winner to go top, an achievement that looked well and truly on when a double from the departing Sary Rahma put the Pupils in pole position.It wasn’t to be the ideal parting gt for the Pupil’s top scorer, a game that could have taken on the guise of a classic, was down to two s unable to defend as units and not as the score suggests the failings of respective defences.It was a crazy match from start to finish the visitors taking an early lead only to be pegged back immediately by Rahma.Neilston restored their lead minutes later, but the McFadyen sponsored Pupils ed to the other end and the game was level once more from a Grumoli strike.The Pupils got their noses in front when Robbie Dudley followed up his own header to score from close range with just  minutes on the clock.Although the game was stretched throughout, it wasn’t devoid of quality,  the home side#s finishing was clinical in the early stages.Three each and only half way through # the referee’s whistle brought the first half to a close and allowed time for everyone to draw breath.Sary Rahma put the home side ahead with  minutes to go and celebrated in some style – possibly his last goal for the home team and maybe the winner The dream finish to a successful stay eluded him, as the home side collapsed in the final quarter to surrender the initiative and points.The extraordinary game also had a thumping free kick from Martin McCallum that almost demolished the cross bar, before he rounded the keeper to narrow the deficit with five minutes left. IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"off road cycle time trial given a yellow jersey","story":"Perfect sunny but cool conditions with hardly a breath of wind, saw  riders, of all abilities, head for the Lussa Loch TT at am on Sunday morning.Club chairman Robert Semple gave his usual safety briefing before the event being run in a semi-remote location.Despite the clear conditions, he gave a word of warning when he advised riders to take great care particularly on descents, saying: #If you go into a ditch on this course you#ll not be climbing back out of it.#It was not just the premiere time trial on forest roads for KWCC but for some road riders, the .-mile event was their first time on mountain bikes.Alex Binnie dubbed the #rocket man,# finished first and said: #Yet another well organised event, Robbie.#I really enjoyed it today, over the moon with my time but I#m pretty sure I#ll not be top of the winter league for long, but in the meantime I#m loving it.#Cycling crofter, Emma Smith, from Taynuilt, came in second having spent the previous day beating for pheasant at Ormsary.McFadyens Contracting director, Tom Millar said: #Very well organised, Robbie, well done, Alex, a great race.#The full results:  Alex Binnie .

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

Work would be spread over six phases and it is anticipated it could be phased over the next  years.The golf club opened in  and planning permission was given nine years ago to expand the facility, with plans including a -bed hotel, new clubhouse, a second course,  lodges and  homes, but that never got off the ground.Eric Martin, who lives in the village and is part of Dunpender Community Council, said residents were still looking at the plans before forming an opinion.Save Whitekirk Campaign has set up an online petition in opposition to the plans.A spokesman said: ldquoThe plans to destroy this wonderful landscape, a haven for wildle, show no respect for the countryside or local communities and are driven solely by profit. With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

representatives from Robertson Group and Ross Development and Renewablesndash both of whom were instrumental in finalising the innovative funding mechanism ndash as well as investors from the Co-op Pension Fund.East Lothian Council worked with Robertson Capital Projectsand RDR to create an innovative delivery and funding mechanism that would allow the homes to be delivered using the councilrsquos long-term affordable rental income to underpin a private sector funding solution.Fty homes are being provided for rent at mid-market rates without subsidy, funded using private sector investment, while  will be for social rent, funded using the councilrsquos capital budget with Scottish Government grant support.All  properties will revert to council ownership at the end of the lease period at no cost to the council.The first houses will be handed over in March for social rent.These new homes will be available to qualying tenants initially from the councilrsquos waiting list at initial rents for a two-bedroom terrace home at pound per month.The remaining properties for mid-market rent will be handed over in tranches through  and  as development progresses.Mr Goodfellow said: ldquoI am delighted that East Lothian Council has been able to reach agreement with partners on this unique finance model, which means we are able to offer more social and mid-market rental properties in a key location next to good schools, public transport links, amenities and facilities, with a minimal capital outlay for the council.ldquoThe fact that these homes will eventually revert to council ownership too means itrsquos a sustainable option for the long term, as well as providing security of tenancies for our residents.ldquoItrsquos a shining example of how working with partners can help shape our communities and give more access to affordable housing options.ldquoSince , more than , new affordable homes have been delivered in East Lothian, of which more than  are new council homes.ldquoSeven-hundred have been delivered through our housing association partners, with the remaining  intermediate tenures such as discounted sale and mid-market rent delivered through other financial models.ldquoThis project fits in perfectly with our Draft Strategic Housing Investment Plan, which sets out an ambition to deliver a further , new affordable homes.The innovative funding model allows the council to use funding support from Scottish Government to deliver much-needed new socially rented homes, with the private sector funding enabling mid-market rental homes in this case.Neil McCormick, managing director, Robertson Capital Projects, said: ldquoWe have been working incredibly hard for the last two years to make this delivery and funding model a reality because we understood the need for private sector support in order for local authorities to meet their key housing targets.ldquoI am confident that it will be the first of many.ldquoWe are deeply proud to have played such a signicant role in what will be deemed as a game changer in the affordable rental housing market for many other local authorities across

Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that.

Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense.

Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success.

I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out.

It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse.

A sigh of resignation here: Irsquom not a huge fan. Itrsquos all very well in the Middle East, say, where mezze dishes are collectively informed by some traditional organising principle, but the hazard in the UK is that you end up eating weird combinations: cold starters alongside shrunken, hot main courses, and full size desserts. If you ask me, therersquos an awful lot to be said for a three-course meal.Still, I get the motivation. Small plates keep down the overall cost of a meal and only people who get a shock when they see how these dishes accrue in price might wondertheyrsquore actually value for money. This formula helps encourage the faulty belief that eating out isnrsquot really much more expensive than eating in.So here we are, tucking into reassuringly sour sourdough bread followed by a random, ldquowhen the kitchenrsquos ready, procession of dishes that frankly, donrsquot go together. The first thing that smacks you between the eyes at Nivens is how good the food looks, yet not in an uptight, obsessional, tricksy way. So here are two smartly dressed Cullen Skink arancini, in a limpid bright green pool of vivid leek pureacutee that has seaweed undertones. The smokiness of the haddock builds up in the mouth incrementally until eventually it releases a tarry pungency found in the smoke-darkened walls of Arbroathrsquos famous smokie lsquobarrelsrsquo . Lemony potato pureacutee piped on top might sound prissy, but isnrsquot. It reminds me of Greek skordalia, and moderates the woody presence.Next comes the onion, spinach and carrot bhaji. So often this B word flags up identiable vegetable matter in a greasy batter, but this one is refined, a three tiered job. At the base, a piquant dal, fiercely spiced with chilli and cumin seed, next the bhaji- tangible caullower florets in a cleanly fried, pungently spiced mass- topped by a translucent, mint-loaded oniony pickle, and coriander. Itrsquos not for wimps, but more fool them.And this treatment of Ramsayrsquos of Carlukersquos pork belly might be the best Irsquove encountered yet. The crusted, caramelised meat is cooked to collapse, its near liquied fat on top dissolving and enriching the lean meat below. Richness is offset by a fennel remoulade that cools and refreshes. The pineapple chunks are weeping their sweet-sharp juices and sizzling hot from the griddle. Net effect  A dish that sits surprisingly lightly on the stomach.Now we get round to the ham hock terrine. Being cold, it has waited its turn after the hot dishes. By this point, itrsquos not really what we want to eat but that doesnrsquot stop us admiring the herby, fatty forcemeat dotted with yellow mustard seeds that encircles soft ham strands, its mellow piccalilli, its fresh apple sauce.From the savoury dishes I form the impression that while Nivens has a most competent chef with not inconsiderable technical aptitude, he or she is cooking in relaxed mode as befits a pub. For pudding, a peanut, banana and honeycomb chocolate pot turns out to be restrainedly sweet and more grown-up than kiddie, despite its toothsome title. Roasted plums, the meaty, tough-skinned US iety, are nicely spiced but under-ripe. They come with meringue and whipped mascarpone. It ticks the pudding box, but I sense that the kitchenrsquos heart is with the savouries. Wersquore served pleasantly and efficiently, and the meal turns out to be really quite cheap, so that confounds my theory. Thus far, Nivens looks like a survivor.Nivens by Cafeacute Source,  Nithsdale Rd, Glasgow   Lunch Dinner pound-Food rating  Joanna Blythman is the Guild of Food Writers Writer of the Year "},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

Irsquom going to look at the detail closely before coming to a final decision about how I will vote in the deal when it comes to the House of Commons.Mr Masterton, elected as the MP for East Renfrewshire last year, wrote on a blog:ldquoDeciding whether or not to support this deal will, short of a decision on whether to go to war, be the biggest decision MPs will make. I will not be rushed, bounced, or forced into reaching a position. To do so would be irresponsible and do you a disservice. You deserve a decision of this magnitude to be properly thought through.ldquoI have read the documents carefully and have a number of concerns. These relate primarily to the Northern Ireland backstop , and aspects of the future relationship framework where there is a real lack of detail.He continued: ldquoI now need to work through those concerns and understand the practical reality and real-world implications in a number of areas. So as of today, I am not in a position to state that I will be supporting the deal.However, he also wrote that leaving the EU without a deal would be a ldquoterrible outcome and voting against the May plan poses an ldquoinherent risk.Mr Duguid wrote yesterday that he is continuing to ldquoseek and receive assurances that the UK will leave the CFP and become an ldquoindependent coastal state.He added: ldquoEU demands for continued, guaranteed access is UNACCEPTABLE.While Mr Lamont and Mr Masterton voted Remain in the  referendum, Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson voted for Brexit.The MP stepped up his criticism of Mayrsquos plan yesterday: \"The PMrsquos plan would create serious new trade barriers between GB and NI. As a Unionist first and foremost I can never accept that.With May struggling to cobble together a parliamentary majority for the draft deal, she desperately needs her Scottish MPs onside.SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \"With all wings of her party against her, it is abundantly clear that Theresa May has no chance of getting her deal through parliament - leaving us all in political purgatory.ldquoRather than trying to please the Prime Minister, the Scottish Tories should be listening to their constituents who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU.\"The best deal short of EU membership is to remain in the single market and customs union.\"It is essential that we avoid both Theresa Mays hard Brexit and a No Deal scenario - and all options must be on the table to achieve that.\"A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \"Scottish Conservative MPs know that their constituents will expect them to scrutinise this draft agreement in detail before they vote, and that is exactly what they are doing.\"Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will tell a forum in Dundee on Monday that Brexit in any form is likely to reduce economic growth.She will use her address at the National Economic Forum on Monday to reiterate her call for the UK to remain part of the single market and customs union.She is expected to tell delegates that leaving the single market will do \"immense damage\" to jobs and living standards in Scotland.Sturgeon will say: \"The UK Governments refusal to even consider the Scottish Governments detailed plan to keep Scotland in the single market, while accepting a dferentiated solution for Northern Ireland, which we support, potentially puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.\"But, perhaps worst of all, it leaves everybody completely uncertain about the shape of our long-term relationship with the EU.\"The seven-page political declaration on the future contains little more than vague aspirations and platitudes.\"But while we can expect more pages forthcoming on some aspects of the future relationship, there will be no concrete reassurances.\"The governments National Economic Forum is a regular event attended by ministers and senior figures from business, the public sector and trade unions to discuss how best to grow Scotlands economy.Sturgeon will address delegates at the Apex City Quay Hotel on the theme of innovation and inclusion.She will say: \"Put bluntly, long-term economic uncertainty is hard-wired into the Prime Ministers withdrawal deal.\"If the UK Government insists on leaving the EU, then it should remain in the single market and customs union. That is the solution which respects the outcome of the referendum, mitigates the worst economic consequences of Brexit and largely resolves the Irish border issue.\"If Brexit goes ahead - in any form - it is likely to reduce economic growth.\"But that doesnt devalue our wider efforts to support business - in fact it makes those efforts all the more important.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-crunch-week-as-tory-critics-plot-her-exit-from-downing-street","story":"The Prime Minister appeared to have gathered momentum on Friday after surviving a spate of resignations from her Government, but she is expected to face a series of challenges to her authority over the next few days.Conservative MPs who have angrily denounced her draft agreement with European negotiators are expected to get close to the  signatures required to force a no- confidence vote in her.A core of influential Cabinet Ministers who voted Leave in the  referendum, led by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, will also meet within days in a bid to persuade May to change course.The Tory civil war comes as senior figures in all the main parties at Westminster insist she will be unable to command a majority for her exit plan.May last week unveiled the  page draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was put together following fractious discussions with the EU.The UK is scheduled to leave the EU next year, but Mayrsquos problems arise from what happens after the completion of the transition period in December .Under the draft,a long-term trade deal has been not agreed by the end of , one option is for the transition period to be extended for a limited period.An alternative, in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is a ldquobackstop consisting of a single customs territory between the EU and the UK.However, the backstop plan infuriated some of Mayrsquos backbenchers as they believe would prevent the UK from entering into new trade deals with other countries, which they argue is one of the main benefits of Brexit.The UK would also be unable to cancel the backstop independently and would need the agreement of the EU, an outcome MPs fear would trap the UK.Publication of the draft agreement led to the resignation of members of Mayrsquos Cabinet, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.It also triggered a campaign on the backbenches to secure the  signatures required to force a no confidence vote in the leader.However, the move to force a vote appeared to stall after MP Steve Baker, vice-chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, over-estimated the number of signatures.Mr Baker had stated on a WhatsApp group that the number was ldquoover , which would have led to a contest, but he later backtracked and said his count had been ldquoinaccurate.One senior Tory told the Herald on Sunday that the figure could reach  by Tuesday, which would lead to a vote soon after.Another Conservative insider said a vote could be an ldquoopportunity for Mayshe won it convincingly.ldquoShe would be able to say she has a mandate for the deal on the table, he said.Another threat for the Prime Minister will come when Gove, whose decision to stay in the Cabinet last week gave May a boost, meets other Cabinet Brexiteers to discuss strategy.It was reported that Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox will meet and try to force May into renegotiating elements of the draft.Meanwhile, May has warned her Tory opponents that rival Brexit withdrawal plans, including the so-called Norway and Canada models favoured by her hardline critics, would not solve the backstop issue.In an interview yesterday, the Prime Minister said: \"People say If you could only just do something slightly dferent, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.May appointed Stephen Barclay as her new Brexit Secretary, the third this year, but the role has been further downgraded as the Prime Minister will in future take sole control of negotiations on EU withdrawal.The job of Barclay, a Leave supporter, will be limited to the domestic delivery of EU withdrawal, preparations for Brexit either with or without a deal and shepherding legislation through Parliament.He said: \"We now need to keep up the momentum to finalise the withdrawal agreement and outline political declaration and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK.\"Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the Prime Minister is \"prepared for anything\", when asked on BBC Radio s Today programmeshe was prepared for a leadership challenge.He added: \"I think that whatever deal, when we see ious dferent organisations and groups talk about dferent ways of leaving the EU - Norway, Canada, all of these things - what we have to be clear about ... is all of those require a backstop.\"In another development, Irelands deputy premier has warned MPs to sign up to the Brexit agreement or risk crashing out of the EU without a deal.Simon Coveney said people were \"too quick\" to write off May, saying she has shown \"resilience, courage\" and a \"reality check\" to Brexiteers in Westminster.He warned it \"will be dficult\" to find an alternative deal that will prevent a hard border. \"If we are forced into that situation we will have to look at ways in which that can be avoided but that will not be easy,\" he added.\"It is a far more sensible approach to support what is being negotiated over the last two years as a way that we know provides the guarantees that we have looked for and insisted on that there will be no physical border or infrastructure or checks or controls and that is an issue that goes beyond commerce and trade.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lord-lester-hopes-decision-to-block-suspension-means-the-end-of-my-ordeal","story":"Lord Lester of Herne Hill was facing the longest suspension in modern parliamentary history after an inquiry found the -year-old had sexually harassed Jasvinder Sanghera and offered her ldquocorrupt inducements to sleep with him.The Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee recommended he should be suspended until June .But on Thursday, peers backed a call to send his case back to the Lordsrsquo Committee for Privileges and Conduct by  votes to , amid claims that the investigation was ldquomanestly unfair.Following a y and impassioned debate, members agreed that the Commissioner for Standards Lucy Scott-Moncrieff had failed to comply with the code of conduct which required her to act ldquoin accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Lord Lester ndash who denies the allegations against him and says they are ldquocompletely untrue ndash said the decision was ldquoa triumph for Parliament, and for equal justice under the law.The prominent QC blasted the investigation process, and said he had been ldquotreated despicably.He told the paper: ldquoI hope this means the end of my ordeal.

It would not. That issue is still going to be there.ldquoSome politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good.It came after a tumultuous week including the departure of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, plus the launch of a high-profile insurrection on the back benches to remove her from office.She responded by bringing former home secretary Amber Rudd, who quit over the Windrush scandal, back into Cabinet to replace Ms McVey at the DWP.Mrs May will continue her attempts to sell the deal to sceptical MPs and the public with a live interview on Skyrsquos Ridge on Sunday.But there seems little sign of the sides coming together.Mr Burt, whose role spans the Foreign Office and Department for International Development, attacked a tweet by Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, in which the latter promoted a lawyerrsquos legal case against the agreement reached with Brussels.Mr Burt wrote: ldquoBe very clear.

I do not believe that everyone who graduated this year has sufficient skills in numeracy to be able to teach it to -year-olds at a reasonable standard.Cue bedlam. Here for the first time was a suggestion the slide in standards could be laid at the door of poorly prepared trainee teachers unable to pass on the essential skills required to make pupils literate and numerate.Even tabloid newspapers became interested in teacher training with the front page of next days Daily Record berating the Scottish Government under the headline \"You Do The Maths\".Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson seized the moment demanding new literacy and numeracy tests for primary teachers at the beginning and end of their course.There was even graver concern when the education committee received a follow-up report from universities which said student teachers on some four-year degree courses could spend as little as  hours on numeracy and  hours on literacy.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was ldquovery concerned by the findings and raised the issue with both universities and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.More than a year on and there is still resentment from some involved in teacher education over the way the issue played out.\"The students were not a representative sample,\" one member of university staff said. \"They were a very specic group who had already written to complain to the committee and they were the only ones selected to speak. It was unfortunate and we are still dealing with the consequences.\"Professor Ian Rivers, chairman of the Scottish Council of Deans of Education, is also concerned about the weight given to some of the statements made to the committee.\"There was no actual evidence that teachers who leave university are unable to teach -year-olds to the appropriate standard,\" he said. \"Every university does its absolute best, working in partnership with experienced teachers, to make sure our students leave able to meet the requirements and professional standards expected of them.\"The committee wanted the literacy and numeracy work we do neatly calculated in terms of the number of hours we deliver, but that is a very narrow view of what we do. All of the work on literacy, numeracy is integrated into the course as a whole so it is very dficult to provide what they wanted. That does not mean that literacy and numeracy is being ignored.\"Mr Rivers also questions the current narrative from headteachers and council officials that the quality of new teachers is not what it was.Local authorities have recorded an increase in the number of probationers having to repeat a year because they were not seen as being of an appropriate standard and school leaders have also raised concerns over quality.ldquoWe do not allow anyone to graduatetheir practice is not up to scratch and that is done with assessments by a member of academic staff from the university in partnership with the classroom teacher they have been working with,\" said Mr Rivers.\"It is very important to understand that teacher education is the starting point of a journey and not the end point. When students are on probation councils are also heavily involved in the development of skills and knowledge as the teacher moves towards becoming a fully registered member of the profession.\"The other concern that has unsettled public confidence in teacher education is drop-out rates. Figures published earlier this year showed the number of new teachers leaving after less than a year had doubled in just four years. In total, almost  probationers have left the profession since the   school year.While the reasons for leaving are not given a wider survey of probationers conducted last year highlighted a number of worrying concerns about the quality of courses and the experience of probationers in schools.Some trainees told how their ldquoappalling experiences at the hands of disinterested lecturers and on placement in classrooms had made them re-think their career path. One said veteran teachers had told them to ldquoleave whilst you still can while another suggested bullying was re within the profession and staff rooms a \"poisonous environment\".The Scottish Council of Deans of Education argues that the drop out rates are not particularly high and are generally stable. However, they acknowledge a growing concern over the ever-increasing demands placed on trainee teachers and the requirement that universities provide the Scottish Government with evidence of how they are addressing a iety of additional areas including looked after children, children with autism, LBGTI pupils, black and ethnic minority pupils and pupils with mental health issues.Moyra Boland, a senior lecturer from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Education, said all of these areas were crucial, but questioned whether it was wise to try and cram them all into a one-year postgraduate course.She said: \"You can never get everything into the curriculum. That will never happen because there is so much to know in schools and it is such a complicated job. You never stop learning as a teacher because every class provides new challenges with new combinations of children.\"Rather than thinking about covering absolutely everything in initial teacher education in Glasgow we are much more focused on how we give our students the skills and dispositions to find the knowledge that they need to support their changing classrooms from year to year.\"Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland , also has concerns over what is expected of trainee teachers and believes the time is ripe for a wider review.He said: \"It would be a good time to look at whether the current system of a one year postgraduate followed by a one year probationary year adequately prepares teachers for the range of youngsters and experiences they will face.\"There are huge added responsibilities on teachers, and therefore on teacher education programmes, and an expectation that everything has to be covered which creates pressures and dficulties.ldquoWe need to stand back and ask,we want teachers to be skilled in covering a wide range of areas from sex education to additional support needs, can we cram all that into an  week university postgraduate programme \"Mr Muir said one solution was to look at a longer period of induction that allowed teachers to undertake the additional studies they require once they were in school so they could focus on the areas most pertinent to the context of their schools.There is also more radical thinking on the current structure of initial teacher education.Professor Chris Chapman, chair of Educational Policy and Practice at Glasgow Universitys Robert Owen Centre, wants to see barriers broken down between universities and schools.\"If we are building new schools we should look at teacher preparation in the design of those buildings. You could have studio classrooms or experimental classrooms where trainee teachers are working with university staff and teachers in a more regular and dynamic way.\"I would like to see university staff co-located in schools and working much more closely on a day-to-day basis with teachers and student teachers and engaging with research. That would create a much more dynamic and reflective set of teachers.\"Raymond Soltysek, a former teaching lecturer at Strathclyde University and now an independent educational consultant, argues Scotland could go much further.He believes the inconsistencies highlighted in the way universities deliver basic skills is an indicator of a system where students at dferent institutions study dferent subjects for dferent s of time and are assessed in dferent ways.\"Perhaps more radical initiatives should be explored,\" he said. \"Many have suggested ious structural changes, including taking professional teacher training back into the public sector.\"However, a model of public ownership might take the form of a National College of Teacher Education ndash a central body run by the GTCS, councils, Education Scotland, teachersrsquo bodies and associations ndash which would centralise matters such as recruitment, course design, student placement coordination and assessment. That would provide much greater consistency in what is delivered across Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  May   s done the impossible - brought Leave and Remainers together  but only against her","story":"The Prime Minister made a dignied, resilient stand last week, before a House of Commons that loathes this proposal.

A Brexit deal that is already dead in the water with the Prime Ministerrsquos own authority at risk as the Tory Party implodes with resignation after resignation from the Government. It is increasingly clear, the Prime Minister is, or now, still in office ndash but she is not in power.The Brexit deal satisfies no one, not least the people of Scotland. Instead of coming back with a deal that protects the economy across the UK, the Prime Minister has shown utter contempt once again to the Scottish people. Despite the fact that Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister has decided to ignore our interests. Yet, the UK Government has agreed a dferentiated deal for Northern Ireland ndash but sold Scotland out. Quite rightly, Northern Ireland is to receive access to the European market, but that dferentiation puts Scotland at a real competitive disadvantage. We are being left high and dry by this deal. England and Wales will get what they voted for, remain voting Northern Ireland is guaranteed a special deal to stay close to the EU, yet Scotland, with the highest vote to remain of any UK nation, has our democratic wishes ignored. Instead, Theresa May wants Scotland to pay the price of a Brexit we didnrsquot support - with lost jobs, household incomes slashed and our NHS under threat.Now I wonrsquot pretend that I expect any Tory Party leader to put the interests of Scotland before their narrow party political interests ndash the broken promises of consecutive conservative leaders have taught us not to expect anything less from them. However, the context in which this conservative leader finds herself should at least cause the Prime Minister to pause for serious consideration. Consideration of the offering we in the Scottish National Party have put to her time and time again. We will vote for a deal that delivers membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. Such a deal would protect our economy, safeguard jobs and maintain living standards. Anything less is economic catastrophe. With  strong MPs, the SNP has  votes ndash and with the parliamentary arithmetic as it is, stacked against the Prime Minister and her insufficient deal, Theresa May should start listening. She should change course.It is time for the Prime Minister toto Brussels and extend Article  to secure continued membership of the single market and the customs union. It is time for the Prime Minister to take her head out of the sand and be realistic. Thousands of jobs will be lost unless a deal is secured that will protect the future of economy. It is completely reckless to risk. Playing a game of wait and see isnrsquot good enough. There is little time left, the Prime Minister cannot sit and wait to seethe Brexiteers to come with their pitchforks. She needs to show some leadership and recognise her deal cannot get through the commons, therefore she must deliver a new deal. Only one deal will carry a majority and secure our economic future ndash and that is a deal that secures continued membership of the single market and the customs union.It has been an excruciating week for the Prime Minister, her party is ided and now she is desperate. There is only one way to see off defeat, and that is to finally put the interests of citizens across the UK first not the interests of the Tory Party. I urge the Prime Minister to take the compromise and keep us in the single market and the customs union. Should she fail, she will not be forgiven and I do not mean just by those with the pitchforks in her own party. The SNP will not allow Scotlandrsquos future to be put at risk or our economy to be ripped apart.

It was a stlingly humid, rainy day in the midst of civil war in the West African nation of Liberia when I met him back in .Along with a few other boy soldiers, J-Boy was guarding a makesht checkpoint on the Po River bridge some  miles or so from the Liberian capital Monrovia.High on cocaine and alcohol and heavily armed, the boys were in an unpredictable, volatile mood and hell-bent on extorting whatever they could from terried civilians fleeing along the road from nearby fighting.Clearly wary of our presence as journalists, my driver offered the boys cigarettes to try and relax the situation before myself and a colleague began chatting with them.Like most boy soldiers J-Boy had a swaggering, boastful air and carried his assault rle like some totemic macho badge of honour. Had he himself ever killed anyone  I eventually asked tentatively.ldquoOh sure man, plenty, plenty, he replied, grinning widely, his eyes scarily unblinking. ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing, he assured me, slapping the assault rle in his lap while speaking Kreyol, the English-based pidgin spoken by many people in Liberia.It was a disquieting confession, one I had little doubt was true. The AK he was referring to of course was the AK-automatic rle, or lsquoKalashnikovrsquo as itrsquos more commonly known throughout the world.Itrsquos been said that the Russian name most often uttered across the globe is not Lenin, Stalin or Putin, but Kalashnikov. The reason is depressingly simple, for there is estimated to be as many as  million Kalashnikov rles in circulation worldwide, thatrsquos almost one for every  people.The Kalashnikov is not just any gun, but a brand name that straddles continents and is as familiar as Coca Cola. With its distinctive banana curved magazine clip, the rles familiar silhouette is part of modern iconography.Mexican drug cartel gunmen boast about their cuernos de chivo, or ldquogoat horns, because of its curved magazine. In Lebanon that same silhouette has made its way onto the flag of the Islamist Hezbollah movement while in Mozambique it features on the countryrsquos coat of arms.In other African countries, the shortened form lsquoKalash, has even become a boysrsquo name. In Britain meanwhile there is a well known racehorse named Kalashnikov, while its cultural symbolism has found its way into movies like Jackie Brown by Quentin Tarantino where black market arms dealer Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson, praises its effectiveness for ldquowhen yoursquove absolutely, positively, got to kill every mother****** in the room.The reality of the Kalashnikov of course is anything but glamorous. It is, in effect, the modern worldrsquos most plentul and efficient killing machine, an infamous utensil of death.Had he been alive today the weaponrsquos designer, former Second World War Russian tank sergeant, Mikhail Kalashnikov, would have been  years old last week. How ironic it is that Kalashnikov himself was born almost a year to the day,  November , after the signing of the armistice on November  , that ended the First World War.No firearm of any kind has killed more people than the Kalashnikov. In the  years since its first prototype was made, the AK- has dealt death to millions. Every year, small arms kill between , and , people in the worldrsquos conflicts with the Kalashnikov accounting for a high proportion and quite possible the majority of this human toll. Kalashnikovs make up more than one in ten of all firearms globally.Despite having been around weapons for most of my working le, Irsquove always felt acutely uncomfortable by their presence. On a point of professional and ethical principle countless times Irsquove declined the chance to hold or be photographed let alone fire a weapon. It only makes an already dficult job more complex when reporters, non-combatants, are seen to be shouldering any kind of arms.Only once have I broken this cardinal rule back in the s in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.ldquoShoot, shoot, mister Daoud! insisted the Afghan commander of my guerrilla hosts for the umpteenth time, as we sat one day watching his men train at a remote camp in a craggy valley in the Hindu Kush mountains.With his holy warriors looking on, the commander slotted a full clip of the boat-tailed bullets designed to give more accuracy into a Soviet-made Kalashnikov and thrust the weapon towards me.There was an uneasy pause, but judging by the looks of the fighters around me, this had simply boiled down to an issue of initiation and acceptance, a very Afghan thing about loyalty and brotherhood. To refuse my hosts now would have made my presence at best uncomfortable, and at worst, untenable.I explained that I would do this one time only, that no photographs should be taken and that he must never ask me to do it again. The commander gave me his assurance and after only minutes of instruction, a battered plastic bottle was set up some distance away as a target.As I squeezed the trigger and the first rounds cracked against some rocks reasonably close to the bottle, the gawping bearded guerrillas who had clustered around began to grin. It wasnt a question of them ever expecting me to fire in earnest, just about passing some strange communal ritual.In the event the experience was to prove instructive, for the ease with which I was able to handle the rle made me realise why the AK- had gained its reputation as a so-called ldquouser-friendly weapon.I realised too why it had become the firearm of choice among mercenary suppliers and illegal arms dealers, who know that those who end up shouldering this oddly toy-like weapon - which fires  rounds a minute, each powerful enough to punch a hole through a personrsquos chest from  yards - will have had little or no proper military training. Or, put another way, it is ideal for everyone from Afghan peasant farmers to school-kids-turned-killers like J-Boy in Liberia or some marauding civilian gunman in an incomprehensible blood lust in a shopping mall.So robust and simple is the Kalashnikov that quite literally itrsquos a gun that child soldiers can take apart and put back together in  seconds.While not especially accurate the gunrsquos controls are unsophisticated with plenty of clearance between it moving parts meaning no matter how clogged it gets with Syrian dust or Congolese mud its mechanism is unlikely to jam and those who use these weapons like such reliability.The Kalashnikovis a weapon for ldquothe small-statured, the mechanically disinclined, the dim witted, and the untrained, observed former US marine turned war correspondent CJ Chivers in his remarkable book The Gun: The Story of the AK-.It is a weapon, he notes chillingly, that allows ldquoordinary men to kill other men without extensive training or complications. So durable is the gun that as a reporter in Afghanistan in , Chivers saw an AK- stamped with the manufacturing date of , something I too have similarly witnessed.Currently some  dferent types of Kalashnikovs are now produced in at least  countries and vast quantities of the weapons have turned up in trouble spots all over the world for decades, especially in Africa.Hundreds of thousands of them disappeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia frequently ending up in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Most of the Kalashnikovs used in the Paris attacks at Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan theatre were purchased in Belgium and traced back to the Balkans.Recently too the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists has led to the uncontrolled spread of Kalashnikovs throughout the country.ldquoUkraine has turned into a supermarket for illegal weapons, says Heorhiy Uchaikin, who heads the Ukrainian association of gun owners, and estimates that Ukrainians now illegally possess as many as  million firearms the majority Kalashnikovs.ldquoIn Ukraine, a gun is like shoe polish in a shoe polish factory, Uchaikin recently observed.If ready availability makes the Kalashnikov ubiquitous, so to does its cost. According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, which monitors illicit financial flows, procuring an AK- on the black market depends on a number of factors, notably the further it travels.In Afghanistan, the gun could cost as little as  while on Mexicorsquos northern border with the US, the price would increase to ,. In Belgium where the Paris Charlie Hebdo perpetrators obtained their Balkan Kalashnikovs, it has a price tag of about ,. An authentic model would cost , in Pakistan but a locally produced model can be obtained in the countryrsquos frontier bazaars for as little as . It is also possible to obtain an AK- through the darknet where costs typically range from , to ,.The independent research group Small Arms Survey based in Geneva points also to the fact that cheaper weapons prices lead to an increased risk of civil war, independently of other conflict risk factors.Countries with more porous borders tend also to have lower weapons prices. This is especially the case in Africa, where such borders allow the supply of weapons to meet demand more readily.The Survey says that in Africa, Kalashnikov prices are the lowest in the world and falling. Income, regulatory effectiveness, war legacy, and supply cost iables all lower the price of weapons, but even controlling for these factors, being located in an African country makes purchasing an assault rle around US  cheaper than the world average.During years of working across the African continent, I have stood on many dirt airstrips watching Soviet-era cargo planes being loaded up with crates of grenade launchers, ammunition and Kalashnikovs much of which often appeared to have been beneath the radar deliveries with little in the way of accompanying ldquopaperwork.ldquoAfrican conflicts are wasteful of weapons ammunition and are always in need of more. The guys who carry this stuff in are just flying truck drivers, Alex Vine who has intensively researched the arms trade and today heads the Africa Programme at Chatham House once told me.He has a point. Back in  just before I encountered J-Boy in Liberia I flew into the capital, Monrovia, on the second humanitarian aid flight ever to have reached the country since the upsurge of the civil war a few weeks before. The aircraft was flown by a group of volunteer pilots who told me that days earlier, coming in to land on the first aid flight, they had almost collided with an unscheduled incoming cargo plane.ldquoLater we found out it was flying in ammunition and guns for President Charles Taylor, which some people said was coming from Libya, the Swedish pilot told me.ldquoIts always the same across Africa, you never know who is flying what.One member of the same pilots own crew even admitted to having ldquoferried a few Kalashnikovs and bullets in his time.Illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons is estimated to be worth . billion to . billion every year, equivalent to about  to  per cent of the legal arms trade. With over a million Kalashnikovs still produced annually, one of the worldrsquos foremost killing machines is set to remain at the centre of the global arms trade for decades to come. Today the Kalashnikov continues to kills more people each day than all the worldrsquos tanks, warplanes and ships combined.As a servant of communism, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died in , made no money from his invention. Had he been a capitalist as well as a master gunmaker, he would have been a billionaire.Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the Kalashnikov ldquoa symbol of the creative genius of our people.The weapon that made Kalashnikov a Hero of the Soviet Union has also appeared on t-shirts and vodka bottles, featured in videos and song lyrics and been re-fashioned in crystal - a gt from Putin to George W. Bush.Before his death in  however, the designer of the worldrsquos most famous rle expressed more than a few regrets about what he had given the world.ldquoI am proud of my weaponhellip but I wish I had invented a machine which people could use, which could do good, for example, a sowing machine, said the peasants son from Siberia. Unfortunately that will never be and sadly as child soldier J-Boy told me that day on the bridge in Liberia, ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

We are now all reaping the bitter harvest. The country has been landed with a bad deal and the unedying spectacle of a roguesrsquo gallery of hardline Brexiteers denouncing the product of their own actions.Parliamentary arithmetic means there is little hope of this deal surviving a vote in the Commons.With Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group in open rebellion, Dominic Raab joining an ever-growing list of former Brexit Ministers, and other Ministers going and gone, the Toriesrsquo time in Downing Street should surely be up. This is beyond a party political argument.So, of course, while there is an element of drama in watching the Tory party turning on itself, the problems of Theresa Mayrsquos deal are far more serious than that.One of Labourrsquos six tests for the Toriesrsquo Brexit is whether it delivers for all regions and nations of the UK. Theresa Mayrsquos negotiations have patently not produced a deal that delivers for the people of Scotland.Scottish Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal that best supports jobs and our economy. Which is why a few weeks after my election as Scottish Labour leader, I said that we needed a new comprehensive and permanent customs union ndash because you need that to protect our manufacturing industry and its supply chains. This would also be the cleanest and best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.We also need a strong and stable single market relationship, one that is good for jobs in our service industries. And we need a deal that guarantees no erosion of workersrsquo and consumersrsquo rights and environmental standards.The Tories Brexit proposal delivers none of those things. For these reasons it has to be rejected by the House of Commons ndash and its why every one of Scotlandrsquos Members of Parliament, regardless of party, must vote down Theresa Mayrsquos deal.But the position of the Scottish Conservative Party is now totally untenable. Their leader, Ruth Davidson, and the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, threatened to resignthe deal did not protect the integrity of the UK. Theresa May ignored them ndash but so far they have clung on to their positions. It is remarkable that Dominic Raab has shown more backbone and integrity than either of Scotlandrsquos leading Tories.The SNPrsquos argument that there must be a separate deal for Scotland is not a matter of political principle. It is an exercise in cynical political posturing.For Scotland to be in a customs union, the logical position is for whole of the UK to be in customs union. A hard border between Scotland and the rest of UK would make even worse the economic damage of Brexit. And remember the UK single market is four times more important for Scotlandrsquos economy than the EU single market.But providing the SNP with the excuse to play fast and loose on this issue is yet another way in which Mayrsquos Brexit threatens the integrity of the UK.Should MPs vote the deal down then this would constitute a total loss of confidence in the Government. From there, the right outcome is a General Election so that the people can finish the job they started in  and sweep the Tories from power.A General Election and a change of government is necessary to break this Brexit deadlock and avoid the no deal outcome. A General Election and change of government would create the conditions for the European Union to stop the clock on Article  and to begin meaningful negotiations with a new government that can deliver a deal to parliament and the country.We need a deal that works for the whole of the UK and it is becoming increasingly clear that is something only an incoming Labour government can deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-question-is-not-whether-ufos-are-real-its-why-the-us-military-have-only-now-admitted-their-existence","story":"If Trevor ever approached you in the city centre, all urine-stained jogging bottoms and uncomfortable familiarity, asking for change towards his train fare home, you wouldnrsquot hesitate to dig deep ndash perhaps handing over your pound smart phone too so he could check the Central Station timetable.Thatrsquos why I believed this establishment-approved Knight of the Realm when he said UFOs were real. The year was  ndash the fag end of true reality, a few years before the mass fractionalisation, isolationism and grotesque self-glorication bequeathed to us by the digital dawn. No phones, no internet, your gran could whistle the Top Ten and  million folk watched Coronation Street.

Nothing that would scare the horses, then ndash or elderly folk too jiggered to get up and change the channel after Corrie.Saucers full of secretsIT was as a prelude to this peculiar pow-wow that host Sir Trevor greeted viewers with an unforgettable soliloquy. ldquoWersquore here tonight not to decideUFOs are real ndash unidentied flying objects clearly are real, he announced, steely-jawed, unblinking. ldquoSomething is in our skies. Wersquore here to discuss what they could be and from where they might originate.It didnrsquot matter that Trevor was likely reading some faceless producerrsquos hyperbolic spiel from an autocue. The signicance lay in the fact someone who didnrsquot cut his own hair or eat roadkill just told the nation UFOs were real.Even unbound by its ubiquitous acronym, unidentied flying objects being legitimised on ITV should have been a cultural watershed ndash a moment where even the most earthbound of cynics recalibrated their stance.Yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the credibility of UFOs has lost much of its worth in terms of cultural currency. Even reputable sightings like the darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland last week barely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own silos.The dying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitable, fascist dystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of true horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and last weekrsquos incident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndashincluding astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and advanced propulsion technologies. The bantz at that Christmas party must be awesome.Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe. Or perhaps were simply in too early a stage of evolution to be interesting.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of mulleted banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing them intimately against their will.Looks like this might just be another column about Brexit after all."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-takes-swipe-at-tory-critics-ahead-of-critical-week-for-brexit","story":"The Prime Minister warned that a change of leadership would not make it easier to get a deal past parliament or the EU, after furious Brexiteer backbenchers started moves to remove her.She told Skyrsquos Ridge On Sunday that as far as she knew the -letter threshold for letters of no confidence needed to start a leadership battle had yet to be reached.In a message to those plotting her downfall, including members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, she said she had not considered quitting.She added: ldquoA change of leadership at this point isnrsquot going to make the negotiations any easier and it isnrsquot going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.ldquoWhat it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThe new Kirkwall Harbour flood prevention scheme are set to be tested.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Sunday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

May has proved she has the cricketer’s staying power, for sure, but not his passion. Her reluctance to leave the stage smacks more of inertia than of any belief in her power to deliver. Watching her make her statement in the House of Commons, as cabinet members and MPs prepared to desert her and opposition MPs hurled abuse, it was that old football chant that came to my mind: “No-one likes us we don’t care.” Except, of course, that when Millwall supporters sang the line it was an expression of defiant solidarity an “us against the world” kind of thing. For May, there is no “us” unless you count her husband Philip, who poured her a whisky after her marathon cabinet meeting. There is only her, ploughing on, never veering from her set course. Like a missile launched into outer space, she seems propelled less by hope or conviction, than by an inability to stop and the lack – so far – of sufficient resistance. Even being compared to appeaser Neville Chamberlain appears to have done little to dint her determination.Has there ever been a lonelier figure in history than May  Macbeth watching the approach of Birnam Wood, perhaps  Or Julius Caesar lured to the Theatre of Pompey by his erstwhile allies  Et tu, Dominic  Et tu, Esther  Et vos, several junior ministers most of us had never heard of  May exudes loneliness the way some people exude vitality. Long before no confidence letters started stacking up, she appeared ill at ease in the company of others, be they members of the public or world leaders. Remember that footage of her at the EU summit in   The one where she fiddled anxiously with her cuffs and searched for someone to talk to, as all around her other attendees greeted each other with hugs and air kisses  I have neither met nor read of anyone who has found in May either a force to be reckoned with or a kindred spirit. Most report her as lacking in presence and conversational gambits. In a rare personal jibe aimed at another woman, Nicola Sturgeon said she found it impossible to get any human connection. As for when May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs: Denis Healey’s famous jibe about being “savaged by a dead sheep” comes to mind.Bingeing on the latest season of the Brexit box-set is emotionally confusing. What are we supposed to feel for this robotic character who refuses to be beaten, even when she so obviously is  Not admiration. There can be no admiration for a leader whose management of everything from Grenfell to the snap general election has been so spectacularly inept. And certainly not for a leader who, while home secretary, introduced the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush and other deportations. Respect is wrong too. How can we respect someone so out of touch with the impact of Tory policies that – even as her party is preparing to tip the country off a clf – she thinks it’s amusing to jig her way out to the conference podium  Despite myself, what I did feel for May, last week, was a sort of muted regard for her obstinacy. May is a Remainer who took on the challenge of achieving the unachieveable – a compromise that would suit everyone – presumably because she felt it was a better option than having negotiations conducted by a sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteer. It was an impossible, thankless task and she was undermined at every turn. Nevertheless, she and her civil servants put together a deal. Perhaps it’s a dog’s dinner of a deal perhaps – as Jo Johnson suggested – it will leave us a “vassal state”, but it’s more than any of her blowhard critics have done. And at least she had the guts to face down the DUP on the Irish Border backstop. May’s deal is unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons, but as any deal capable of passing through the House of Commons is unlikely to be agreed by Brussels, she was always on to a loser.Yet, while she is taking all the flak, where is the man who kicked this off this fiasco in a misguided attempt to buy off his party’s right-wingers  At a financial conference in Florida, of course. David Cameron is a shameless dilettante who takes responsibility for nothing. His catastrophic miscalculation has never stopped him sleeping at night. He left No  with nary a backward glance. The same is true of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who were last week spotted enjoying a cosy drink at an upmarket restaurant, and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is currently in Washington.Whatever  May lacks – grace, empathy – she does not lack a sense of civic duty. Why  would she plough on, pushing a deal in which she cannot believe to a party that only tolerates her because it doesn’t know what  to do  Anyone  would have packed up long ago and headed for the nearest wheatfield.This is not an endorsement of May’s premiership, which has been characterised by a series of humiliations and mistakes, and an inability to answer questions with anything other than her sound-bite du jour. Her craven cosying up to Trump still makes me queasy.But imagine the resolve it takes to get up every day and face the public when you are assailed from all sides when you know that some of those, like Michael Gove, who have agreed to join your cabinet, have only done so in the hopes of bringing you down from within when you know no gain is ever going to come from all the pain.Imagine putting yourself through all that when you are aware your legacy will be naught. No matter how this turns out, May is going to go down in history as one of our worst-ever prime ministers.When she first became leader, the columnist Marina Hyde rfed on a Katharine Whitehorn quote which asked: “Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty clothes-basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing ” May, Hyde said, was “the cleaner thing.”It was true then and it’s true now. It is a testament to the amorality of almost everyone  involved that the prime minister comes across as a person with a degree of integrity . She is the best of a very bad bunch.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831449.1542541554!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm tory brexit zealots out of touch with reality","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Eurosceptic zealots are as out of touch with reality about ousting the Prime Minister as they were about an easy Brexit, writes Euan McColm.How fitting it was that, as they moved in for the kill on Prime Minister Theresa May, the jackals of the Tory right couldn’t get their story straight. They have form for this, after all.\u2028Conservative Brexiteers and their fellow travellers blithely lied their way to victory in the  EU referendum campaign, making undeliverable promises and insisting that anyone who dared raise legitimate points of concern was part of a cynical plot to undermine democracy. Anyone who says Brexit isn’t going to be easy or that it’s going to damage the UK’s economy – and standing in the global community – is a liar, they lied.And so there was a certain black comedy on Friday when it turned out the organiser of a rebellion aimed at bringing down Prime Minister Theresa May was talking out of his arse.To trigger a vote of no confidence in the PM,  per cent of her MPs must submit letters supporting the move to the  Committee, which represents the views of Tory backbenchers. Early on Friday, the organiser of the current rebellion, Steve Baker MP, said he was confident the threshold had been reached and then some. Not only had more than  Conservative MPs passed letters to  Committee chair Sir Graham Brady, another dozen colleagues were set to join them.Predictably, Baker – a classic Little Englander Eurosceptic wing-nut – wasmistaken.As the day progressed, Brady revised his statement. The truth was that the  threshold had not been met. But it would be, he reckoned, “more likely next week”.It is, of course, true that Baker’s initial statement may – over the next hours and days – come to be true, but on Friday morning, he unleashed some classic Brexiteer bulls**t. Still, we are all sick, as Eurosceptic Michael Gove said in , of experts, so who caresBaker’s facts were anything but Let us say that the hard right of the Tory Party is able to drum up the required number of letters, that  per cent of MPs decide she has to go – that would be the end of May, surely  Evenshe was to survive a confidence vote by securing the support of a simple majority of the Tory Westminster group, she’d be so badly damaged that her resignation would be inevitable. That’s how these things work, isn’t it Under normal circumstances, that would probably be true. But, as is abundantly clear to anyone paying the slightest attention to UK politics, we are not living through normal circumstances.Baker and his fellow extremists, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries and David Davis, may indulge a fantasy where a Eurosceptic Tory leader takes over and makes a success of the Brexit disaster they have created, but – as is their way – they haven’t thought things through.The existence of these snakes in the Tory grass is hardly news to the PM. May knows – and has known since succeeding David Cameron in  – that these right-wingers do not support her. For these rebels, this rabble of frauds who claimed two years ago that Brexit would be a breeze, departure from the EU without any kind of deal would be just dandy and to hell with the consequences. They may be about to find out that the majority of their colleagues do not share their enthusiasm for tossing a match on the UK haystack.Success for the Tories’ right-wing nationalists in this instance would not just end the career of the Prime Minister, it would fundamentally change the Tory Party. Just as the victory of Jeremy Corbyn in the  Labour leadership contest moved the opposition towards the hard left, so victory for Baker and his cohorts would drag the Conservatives further right. The result of last year’s general election, in which Corbyn lost to the most chaotic Tory government in living memory, surely tells us thatone wishes to win elections, one should avoid extremism. Compared with Corbyn, May, for all her flaws, appeared the more moderate candidate and the cautious electorate voted accordingly.In the fever dreams of Tory Eurosceptics, former foreign secretary and perpetual charlatanBoris Johnson rides into town and cleans things up. He ruffles his hair, puffs out his chest and tells those foreign sorts they can whistle for any kind of financial settlement, and sets the UK on course for a bright new isolationist future.The slight flaw in this fantasy, as one Eurosceptic MP who’s backing the PM told me, is that a majority of the Tory parliamentary group is unlikely to pass a motion of no confidence in her Eurosceptics may despise May but Remainersfear a Johnson prime ministership would be a disaster. The words of Gove – who may, ironically, be an expert in this area – in , when he withdrew support Johnson’s leadership bid claiming his colleague was unfit to lead the party, still echo. All of this being so, it seems to me that the best possible outcome for May would be for the -letter threshold to be reached. If it is not, then the Eurosceptics on her backbenches will remain a daily problem, working to get the support they need to trigger a vote and – all the time – undermining the Prime Minister.Yes, a confidence vote would be unpleasant but – as seems likely – she were to win it, she would create for herself some breathing space. Under Tory rules, she could not be challenged again for a year, which would give her time – and authority – to try to reach a deal with the EU with which she is,not happy, comfortable.Baker and his right-wing chums strutted around last week asTheresa May’s defenestration was a done deal. In fact, it is far from so. Tory Eurosceptics – “bastards” in the words of former PM John Major – may have set themselves on course for a prolonged period of political irrelevance.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831486.1542528510!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence case stronger after scotland sidelined in brexit talks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP MP Joanna Cherry says the case for Scottish independence has only been strengthened during Brexit negotiations.

This is a fundamental principle of democracy, a good precedent to set and one which justies a second independence referendum despite the No vote in .Those who want to stop Brexit but oppose a People’s Vote offer no alternative course of action.We already know that Article  could be revoked with the EU’s agreement, and with the Scottish case seeking to establish that it can be unilaterally revoked now headed to the European Court of Justice, SNP MPs have the chance to lead the way out of Brexit.It has been suggested that SNP support for a People’s Vote should be conditional on securing certain guaranteesEngland once again votes to leave while Scotland votes to remain.I believe that this misunderstands the nature of the movement for a People’s Vote. This movement is not supported by the UK government or, as yet, by the official opposition.Rather, it is a cross-party and no-party coalition responding to public demand.The movement is therefore not in the position to make any guarantees andthe past two years have taught us anything, it is that setting unachievable red lines is not wise.However, the window of opportunity for a People’s Vote is short.It can only be delivered by a cross-party coalition, which includes the support of the Labour Party. If this opportunity is lost, orthe result of a People’s Vote is again that Scotland votes Remain while England votes Leave, the mandate for a second independence referendum cannot be ignored any longer.That is not to say that independence for Scotland will go off the agendathe UK as a whole votes to remain in the EU. The case for independence has only been strengthened by the way Scotland has been sidelined and devolution undermined during the Brexit negotiations.

There was also support from Brexiteer Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said he had “full confidence in the Prime Minister” and added: “What we need now is stability.”And in a marked departure from Mrs May’s “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra, he told an event in Bristol: “Ultimately I hope that across Parliament we’ll recognise that a deal is better than no deal.”However, there were signs that the Brexiteers remaining in Cabinet could continue to work against the Prime Minister behind the scenes. There were reports Mr Gove and Mr Fox would meet with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom to discuss how to push for concessions on the issue of the Irish border backstop.Mrs May sought to shore up her position by bringing one of her closest allies back into government, appointing Amber Rudd as Work and Pensions Secretary.The Prime Minister has also taken personal control of Brexit negotiations with Brussels, appointing a junior figure as Brexit Secretary to oversee domestic preparations for leaving the EU.Stephen Barclay, a former whip and junior minister at the Treasury and Department of Health, takes over from Dominic Raab, who sparked chaos by resigning on Thursday over the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement.There is just over a week left until a planned special EU summit to sign off the UK’s “orce deal”, and finalise a political declaration setting the direction of travel for future trade talks.Downing Street said this would be handled by the Prime Minister and UK officials in Brussels.In a statement, Downing Street declined to say whether the Brexit Secretary post had been offered to anyone  before the North-East Cambridgeshire MP, following reports Mr Gove and the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox had both turned it down, saying only: “He was the Prime Minister’s choice for the job.”Ms Rudd, who stood in for the Prime Minister in televised debates during the  election campaign, resigned as Home Secretary in April over the Windrush scandal.Asked what Mrs May would say to victims of the Windrush scandal who might feel the Hastings  Rye MP’s rehabilitation had come too soon, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The government has apologised, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary apologised for the Windrush scandal … work is ongoing to make sure those people are properly compensated.”Yesterday the Prime Minister had a taste of some of the bewilderment at the deal while taking questions on a morning radio phone-in programme, with one caller telling her she had “appeased” the EU like Neville Chamberlain in his negotiations with Hitler.Another claimed Jacob Rees-Mogg would make a better leader.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831475.1542527477!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard scottish independence vote would be worse than brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says the turmoil of Brexit would be #nothing# compared with the uncertainty caused by a second independence referendum and a vote to leave the UK.In an exclusive interview with Scotland on Sunday to mark his first year in charge of the party at Holyrood, Leonard calls for a general election to end the impasse over EU withdrawal and admits to having disagreements with Jeremy Corbyn.Leonard, , has endured a tumultuous first  months, criticised for his performances at First Minister’s Questions and accused of “purging” Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie from his shadow cabinet during a reshuffle last month.But the former union official says he believes his party is slowly starting to win a “battle of ideas” with the SNP on issues such as education and health.: Pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to call new Scottish independence voteWithin hours of the draft EU withdrawal agreement being published this week, there was renewed pressure on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to call a second independence referendum.Sturgeon was withering in her response to the deal and where it leaves Scotland, but despite calls for a second vote she has so far refused to be drawn on indyref.Leonard says the dficulties and uncertainty created by Brexit would pale into insignicance compared with the fallout should Scotland sever ties with the UK.“The turmoil of coming out of an economic relationship which has been in place for  years would be nothing compared with the economic turmoil of coming out of a relationship which has lasted  years,” he says.“Given the extent to which we are in a highly integrated level of monetary, economic, social and political union with the rest of the UK, I think the challenges would be huge.” He adds that a hardening of attitudes on whether there should be a second independence vote make it unlikely Sturgeon will call one in the near future.“The signals she was giving [at FMQs] suggest she is not minded any time soon to call a second independence referendum,” he says.“I can only surmise that’s because she can see just how unappealing the Brexit process has been to people and the concerns that has raised. I think she understands that would be multiplied considerably in the event of her calling for a second referendum.”Leonard says during campaigning for last year’s elections, he detected a growing sense of “hostility” on the doorsteps to the prospect of a second independence vote.“Don’t get me wrong, there were still some people who were very enthusiastic about Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP and independence, but those people who didn’t warm to that were increasingly hostile and I think she understands that,” he says.Despite his party’s sluggish performance in opinion polls at a UK level, the Scottish Labour leader says there should be another general election, one he thinks Corbyn can win.But despite being seen as the Corbynista candidate during last year’s leadership contest, Leonard admits to having what he calls “robust discussions” with his party’s Westminster leader, particularly after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s decision not to oppose tax cuts for higher earners in last month’s Budget.“You can characterise that as a disagreementyou want, it’s certainly a dference in policy,” he says. “We’ve had some robust discussions, but we’ve got a working relationship and I’m not going to go around trying to manufacture disputes in order to demonstrate the dferences we have. “There’s got to be a fresh approach to Brexit. My own view is the best way to achieve that is for there to be a general election. This is a political crisis and there’s a growing prospect of it being a constitutional crisis. That propels us, in my view, in the direction of a general election.“What Labour has said is that we are prepared to consider options. The mandate we would seek would, in my view, be a mandate to renegotiate the terms of Brexit.”During the past year, Yorkshire-born Leonard has had to defend his party’s decision to withdraw funding for former leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal defence in a defamation action brought by pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell, publisher of Wings Over Scotland. And he was accused of carrying out a “purge” after removing Sarwar and Baillie from his front bench last month. Leonard says that decision was not about “political dferences”, but about trying to “reach out and appeal to voters we need to win back”.He says it is for others to judge his performance as leader, but that his party has made important interventions on issues such as the future of Monklands Hospital in Lanarkshire.“It’s clear that we are starting to make progress,” he says. “A lot of the work we’re doing on reaching out to trade unions and working people and the work we’re doing to build our profile in the communities, we are starting to get a resonance and a traction again. “There’s a long way to go and I’ve always approached this job as a challenge to try and win a battle of ideas. The next Scottish Parliament election is not until , so I’m content there’s still time and we have an opportunity to build up a positive message of hope. We are the only party which is avowedly anti-austerity and we are leading the debate over the ownership of our public services.”Among Leonard’s big ideas are a new industrial strategy that would see smaller Scottish firms championed at the expense of multinationals. According to Labour, foreign-owned firms have received more than £m in Regional Selective Assistance grants from Scottish Enterprise since the SNP came to power, compared with £m for Scottish companies. “We need to move beyond this scenario where we just simply react to crises all the time,” says Leonard. “We need to have a proactive, forward-looking approach to industrial policy … with Brexit, it becomes even more imperative that we don’t just leave things to chance.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October .

While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8697291.1541638970!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition winners","story":"The winners of the Johnston Press competition, in association with Ulster Rugby,for family tickets to tomorrow#s night#s special fixture at Kingspan Stadium or Ulster v Uruguay have been confirmed.Each winner received a family ticket for the game, the first time in  years Ulster will have faced international opponents.The winners were: Terry McCorry, Newtownabbey Sarah Walker, PortadownCathal Gilmore, Lford.Congratulations to them andyou were unlucky on this occasion, tickets for the game, which has a .pm kick-off can be purchased at ulsterrugby buytickets£, reward offered in hunt for man who assaulted NI Railways employeeMid and East Antrim prepares to remember the fallen Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you.

The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children.

This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

We are not a party of no deal. However, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyones right to examine the Prime Ministers draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it is appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said both in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one, that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to best endeavours are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EUs state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Irelands campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on the table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft withdrawal agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop in whole or in part also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland may have to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys. Thats not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing Cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as a de facto border in the Irish Sea. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no-deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of the Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.

Its a real issue and it needs urgent attention.\"Alderman Tom Haire, who supports the operation of -hour bus lanes during the week, said he favours a free flowing road network at the weekend, where all lanes are open to all traffic.\"All traffic needs to be able to access the city centre on a Saturday for the overall economic wellbeing of Belfast - and now would be a good time to make that happen,\" the DUP man said. Independent councillor Declan Boyle said ditching the bus lanes on Saturdays was essential for the citys economic revival.\"Bus lanes are right up there with the cost and dficulty of car parking in Belfast as major deterrents to shoppers,\" he said.\"Bus lanes should only operate at peak times during rush hour and at no other time. Saturdays should definitely be out.\"A Translink spokeswoman said: \"We want to make public transport as attractive as possible and keep the city moving. \"Bus lanes help us bring more people into the city centre and with the launch of our Christmas package this week, including fare offers and special services, bus lanes are an important role in successfully delivering this.\" A spokeswoman said the Department for Infrastructure has invested £m in the Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system in keeping with the draft Programme for Governments aim to encourage people to choose sustainable forms of transport.\"In order for Glider to be successful, the services must be able to operate smoothly along the routes,\" she said.\"The bus lanes are vital to ensure bus services can operate at a high frequency and on time to help guarantee journey time reliability. \"This will in turn make public transport a more attractive option and encourage more people to leave their cars at home.\"Evidence from Translink is that while bus patronage on a Saturday is lower than on weekdays it is still signicantly higher than on a Sunday. \"In addition, bus frequency is similar on a Saturday to that on weekdays. In view of this, and the need for consistency to avoid confusion, it is therefore equally important to have bus lane priority on a Saturday. \"The department recently provided additional funding of £, to enable Translink to deliver a high impact festive campaign, offering major fare discounts and extra services.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"leading northern ireland business organisations back mays draft deal as way ahead but dup is not for moving","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not believe it was the best deal for Northern Ireland.It follows days of chaos over the Brexit plan agreed between the UK and the EU.As the fallout continued yesterday:Stephen Barclay was named the new Brexit Secretary as Prime Minister Theresa May set about filling her cabinet after several of her top team quit.Speculation grew that the PMs critics have the numbers required to trigger a confidence vote within days.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar admitted it would be \"very dficult\" to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann branded the inclusion of the backstop in the withdrawal text as a \"monumental error in judgment\".The proposed deal has sparked chaos within the Conservative Party since it was unveiled on Wednesday. Mrs Mays premiership is hanging by a thread with a series of ministerial resignations and calls from her own MPs for her to stand aside.A vote of no confidence in her leadership could take place as early as next week.The DUP - which Mrs May relies on to stay in power - are also unhappy.Yesterday, however, leading business organisations representing Northern Ireland issued a joint statement in support of the draft agreement.The Confederation of British Industry NI, Federation of Small Businesses NI, Institute of Directors NI and NI Chamber of Commerce said the deal \"provides some much needed clarity that local businesses have been calling for\".\"While by no means perfect, it provides a  to move onto the critical next stage and allows work to begin on the formulation of a comprehensive future trade deal,\" it said. \"Crucially, the provision for an extended transition period offers our members the flexibility and time to adjust to a new relationship with the EU which they must be allowed to do in as smooth and orderly a manner as possible.\"It repeated warnings that a no-deal Brexit would be \"deeply damaging\" and would represent \"a very bad outcome\" for businesses, consumers and the economy.Earlier, the UFU, which represents thousands of farmers, many of whom would traditionally vote DUP, called on the party to vote for the text.UFU chief executive Wesley Aston told the Nolan Show: \"We want to make sure we avoid a no-deal situation. No deal for Northern Ireland agri-food and farming in particular would be absolutely disastrous and we have made that patently clear over this last while.\"He added: \"We would support the deal going through and against that background we would ask the DUP to consider voting for this deal.\"UFU president Ivor Ferguson told the Belfastindependent reports had concluded that a no-deal Brexit would have disastrous consequences for farm businesses and the economy here.He said: \"Ultimately, we would have preferred a UK-wide solution. However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome.\"Brian Irwin, chairman of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association, also hailed the draft withdrawal agreement, saying it \"provides a way to deliver a smooth exit and an orderly transition to the future relationship with Europe\".But speaking to the Belfast , Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUPs view of the deal has not changed.\"We very much respect that there are people within the business community and farming who have a dferent view to us on Brexit, and indeed many of them campaigned against Brexit in the first instance,\" he said.\"Therefore it comes as no surprise that they would want to support a deal that keeps Northern Ireland locked into the EU in terms of both customs and the single market.\"While we respect their opinion, we disagree with their conclusion that this is the best deal we can get for Northern Ireland. We believe that a border in the Irish Sea is not in the interests of either our farmers or our business owners, because Great Britain is by far our biggest and best market.\"It is our view that anything that creates barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in economic terms is not good for our economy.\"Earlier, the Lagan Valley MP faced criticism over comments on the BBCs The View when he was asked to respond to comments supporting the deal from the UFU and the Northern Ireland food and drink sector.\"I dont believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the  pages,\" he had said.Ian Marshall, a former UFU president turned Irish senator, accused Sir Jeffrey of being \"disrespectful\"."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates latest travel","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Competitive friendly, but Northern Ireland were our guests tonight in Dublin!\"And Irish Health Minister Simon Harris said their actions were \"embarrassing and idiotic\". \"I think it is highly regrettable. It was a minority, albeit a loud minority. But they were quite frankly idiots and it shouldnt have happened,\" he said.A group of Republic fans were also heard chanting offensive songs in a bar before the game, including \"You can shove your f****** poppy up your a***\", \"Youre not Brazil, youre not a country, so go f*** your Union Jack\" and \"James McClean, he hates your f****** Queen\".Gardai said there were a small number of skirmishes at the event, but no arrests were made.Northern Ireland does not have an official national anthem, but plays God Save The Queen at football matches.UUP MLA Doug Beattie said: \"I think its pretty simple - we should all show respect to a nations national anthem. \"I stand and I would show my respect to the Irish national anthem as I do for any other country and I would expect people to do exactly the same for the UKs national anthem.\"I think those in the stadium are not indicative of the Irish people, I think its just people in that stadium and maybe its just football in general, I dont know.\"But each national anthem needs to be shown respect on sporting occasions like this and ordinarily it normally would. But I think this was not right, to be honest.\"Meanwhile, there has been condemnation after images emerged showing a Northern Ireland fan on his way to the match waving a Parachute Regiment flag.He was pictured with the purple flag of the regiment that killed  civilians on Bloody Sunday in  and is being investigated over the Ballymurphy Massacre in , when  people were shot dead. The image was branded \"an absolute disgrace\". Some said it was a deliberate attempt to antagonise Republic supporters."},{"url":null,"title":"listen pilots report multiple ufo sightings in irish airspace investigation underway","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he would try to convince finance minister Moshe Kahlon and his centrist Kulanu party to stay in the coalition.“It would be both unnecessary and incorrect to go to elections. We remember well what happened when elements inside the coalitions took down Likud governments in  and in ,” Mr Netanyahu said, noting the past two elections in which the Labour Party came to power.“We need to do everything we can to prevent repeating these mistakes,” he added.The sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of Mr Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the  Israel-Hamas war. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Avigdor Lieberman quit as Israel’s defence minister He alleges the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon’s heavily armed Hezbollah group.The departure of Mr Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the -member parliament. Mr Netanyahu’s other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single MP until elections scheduled for November .Education minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, has already threatened to bring down the governmenthe is not appointed defence minister. Mr Kahlon says another year of such instability will harm the economy.Mr Netanyahu is trying to convince them to stay, and his Likud allies are already preparing to pin the blame on themthat effort fails.“I think that there is no reason to shorten the term of a national government, not even for one day, and at this moment it’s in the hands of the education minister and the finance minister,” said Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security.No Israeli government has served out its full term since . Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election."},{"url":null,"title":"derry teenager type 1 diabetes praised role model young people","story":"If there’s one thing local teenager Harry Wilson is not short of while living with Type  diabetes over the past decade, it’s energy!Harry , who was diagnosed when he was four years old, plays an active role in helping to raise diabetes awareness and is a role model for young people coping with the condition.He is fully supported not just at home and in school but through the family business Click Energy which a year ago chose Diabetes UK Northern Ireland as its official charity for .The charity partnership selected by the Click Energy team, was inspired by seeing how well Harry, the son of Managing Director Damian Wilson, managed his diabetes from such a young age and show how you can still lead a normal le.Harry has also helped Diabetes UK Northern Ireland review guidance for young people managing the condition in school where they spend so much of their lives.He explained: “I have probably coped quite well because I’m used to having diabetes since I was four. It was more of a worry for my parents when I was diagnosed but it’s just part of everyday le now and as long as I stay on track managing it should be fine.”Harry is one of around seven pupils at his school with diabetes and as well as supporting each other they have the added support of classroom assistant Anne Beattie, the diabetes champion at St Joseph’s Boys’ School in Derry, who knows the complexities only too well as she is also Type , and staff member Rosin McLaughlin is always on hand to help as well. Harry knows how vital it is to check his blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of the carbs and he wears an insulin pump which he administers himself when required.Speaking ahead of World Diabetes Day on November th, the teenager said that while he had missed a lot of P and P following his diagnosis, there was now better awareness in schools about diabetes and help with monitoring blood sugars.He also reassured any young people newly diagnosed with the condition that they can still pursue the same hobbies as their friends, including competitive sports.Like most lads his age, Harry enjoys playing football, is also a good swimmer and golfs twice a week. With entrepreneurship in the genes, he’s already considering dipping his toe in the family business where his mum Martina also works in Customer Service.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDamian Wilson, who founded Click Energy - Northern Ireland’s fastest growing electricity provider – in , said he was very proud that the eldest of their three children was a role model for young people with diabetes as a result of his own experience with the condition.“Harry is a very caring young man and diabetes hasn’t stood in his way,anything it has made him more headstrong and independent. He loves ‘The Apprentice’ and is a big fan of Sir Alan Sugar so hopefully he will start working here at  to gain some experience.”Currently, there are , people living with either Type  or Type  diabetes in Northern Ireland, and this figure is on the rise, making the need for education and awareness surrounding the condition more important than ever.People with Type  diabetes cannot produce insulin. About  per cent of people with diabetes have Type . No-one knows exactly what causes it, but it’s not to do with being overweight and it isn’t currently preventable. It’s the most common type of diabetes in children and young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family. We know how important it is to have a network of family, friends, colleagues, class mates and healthcare professionals who are all there for support when it’s needed. We really appreciate all the help we receive and encourage everyone to continue to raise funds and awareness about this serious condition.”ABOVE - Damian Wilson, MD of Click Energy and his son

raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried

They also need to put measures in place wherebythere is a delay that this is immediately communicated to the affected residents.”Safety Responding, a spokesperson for NIE said that the efforts of engineers had been hampered by ‘adverse weather conditions’, adding that it had been dficult to provide customers with an exact time for when the issue would be resolved due to ‘complexity’ of the problem.“NIE Networks received reports of a fault at Paddock Lane at approximately pm on Friday, November ,” a spokesperson said. “An underground electricity cable had been accidentally damaged by a third-party contractor resulting in a small number of customers experiencing loss of electricity supply. “The damaged cable required isolation for safety reasons before engineers could begin to carry out repairs. The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When in  David Cameron committeed to holding the In-Out referendum, he never thought he would be in a position to implement it. After he unexpectedly won the  election outright, Mr Cameron held a quick vote in expectation of an early win. He didnt, and it set in train a motion that has led to constitutional damage for Northern Ireland.

Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader in , and was so radical that he was treated with contempt by his own MPs, who even isolated him in the chamber.Business groups and UFU silent on prospect of an Irish Sea border Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In , he faced a leadership challenge, a mere  months into the post. Everyone said he would never win a general election.To the Tories’ delight, he saw off that challenge.By early , Labour ratings were lower than they had been since the Second World War. A Corbyn premiership was seen as almost impossible.Quite understandably, Theresa May thought she not only could win a snap general election, but was in a better position to do so than almost any incumbent prime minister. This would strengthen her Brexit negotiating hand.When the exit poll came through on June  at pm, my two simultaneous thoughts were: that the conventional wisdom on Jeremy Corbyn had been shown to be rubbish and might one day be PM, and that Mrs May would struggle to get Brexit through. So it has proved.While the story in London is mainly one of miscalculation, the story in Northern Ireland is partly one of miscalculation but mainly one of indference.In July , I wrote an article about the possibility of Scotland voting to leave the UK, and the UK quitting EU – a scenario that would “rock Northern Ireland to the core”.Yet there was almost no interest here in that Scottish independence referendum, not until the last fortnight in September when polls suddenly found that the race was tight. Unionists seemed unaware of the huge risks to us in NI of a Scottish departure.Two years later, in , there was a similarly low level of interest in the Brexit campaign, until the final weeks. And even in those final weeks, the debate here focused more on the national question, than the local implications .It is wrong though to say, as some people now do, that the DUP or unionists campaigned strongly for Leave. A number of unionist politicians did so, and they were more visible than unionist supporters of Remain. But most unionist politicians were muted in the campaign. There was certainly no signicant sense of any threat to the Union, unlike in Gibraltar, where concern at how Brexit might impact its status as British led to a % vote against quitting the EU.It is often said that some key unionists were relaxed about Brexit because they thought it would not happen, but that cannot explain the lack of any sense of danger in the two-and-a-half years that have elapsed since the referendum and the casual, repeated calls for NI to leave both customs union and single market, like rest of UK.Why is this  An obvious reason is the Tory-DUP deal, which made it harder to envisage Theresa May doing anything that might cause her government to collapse.But then there were was the disastrous backstop of December , which showed the government was more concerned about meeting the concerns of another jurisdiction, the Irish Republic, than of its own territory, Northern Ireland, despite being propped up by NI MPs.Unionism has been in denial since December, partly because the DUP secured paragraph  to the backstop, which seemed to rule out an Irish Sea border. And so a sense of calm continued to prevail.The Ulster Unionist Party points out that it opposed the backstop, as it did, and as did I and most unionists. The DUP had to put a brave face on it, given their position.Despite all this, there has been no sense of danger until now.The backstop meant that NI will never be able to leave the EU customs and regulatory space. It means a permanent Irish Sea border, and a major onethe UK in future leaves the customs union as well as the single market, while we are forced to stay in both.The complexity of Brexit and all its elements is a major reason that there has been no sense of danger.But another reason is that many soft unionists seem not to care about constitutional damage. They are apathetic, happy with an invisible border in the Irish Sea that gives us access to EU markets.I am not aware of any signicant opposition in the Alliance Party, which was once solidly pro Union, to its stance, which accepts a border in the Irish Sea but not at land.I might be attracted to the so-called ‘best of both worlds’ myselfI was not deeply worried about the long-term implications with regard to our unfettered access to the United Kingdom market.Now, in a fresh dficulty for unionist politicians, business leaders are coming out in force in defence of Theresa May’s Brexit deal.This is a huge problem for unionists. Some might hope for no deal, but it is clear the Tories and Labour will do almost anything to avoid that outcome, including, as we have seen, accepting the Irish Sea border they all said they opposed.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8708824.1542380567!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit is knocking the joy out of christmas preparations  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Brexit is knocking the joy out of Christmas preparationsSandra ChapmanPublished::Friday  November Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Columnists\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valI wish it was over. Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is uncertainty for people and their jobs.ldquoWhat it will do is mean that it is a risk that we delay the negotiations and that is a risk that Brexit gets delayed or frustrated.Mrs Mayrsquos interview came after former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, whose resignation last week was a key point in one of her most brutal weeks as Prime Minister, suggested she had failed to stand up to a bullying European Union.There were also continuing reports of a plan by senior Cabinet ministers who remain in Government to try to alter the withdrawal agreement at the th hour.Asked about this, Mrs May said that ldquothere is indeed more negotiation taking place and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Raab told the BBCrsquos Marr show that he supported the Prime Minister ndash but not her deal, adding: ldquoI want her to get this right.But he also confirmed he had been speaking ldquointensively with Andrea Leadsom and other ministers looking to change her deal.He said: ldquoI only resigned on Thursday morning so I canrsquot say I have had extensive conversations.

That is uncertainty for people and their jobs.ldquoWhat it will do is mean that it is a risk that we delay the negotiations and that is a risk that Brexit gets delayed or frustrated.Mrs Mayrsquos interview came after former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, whose resignation last week was a key point in one of her most brutal weeks as Prime Minister, suggested she had failed to stand up to a bullying European Union.There were also continuing reports of a plan by senior Cabinet ministers who remain in Government to try to alter the withdrawal agreement at the th hour.Asked about this, Mrs May said that ldquothere is indeed more negotiation taking place and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Raab told the BBCrsquos Marr show that he supported the Prime Minister ndash but not her deal, adding: ldquoI want her to get this right.But he also confirmed he had been speaking ldquointensively with Andrea Leadsom and other ministers looking to change her deal.He said: ldquoI only resigned on Thursday morning so I canrsquot say I have had extensive conversations. But I am willing to talk and be as constructive as I can.He warned MPs against submitting no confidence letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, saying: ldquoItrsquos a total distraction from what we need to do, we need to get Brexit over the line, we need to support our Prime Minister.ldquoI have got huge respect for her, I wrote that in my resignation letter, it is not flim-flam.ldquoI have worked very closely with her on Brexit and I think there is still the opportunity to get this right, support the Prime Minister ndash but she must also listen and change course on Brexit.Askedshe had considered stepping down, Mrs May said: ldquoNo I havenrsquot.ldquoOf course it has been a tough week, actually these negotiations have been tough right from the start, but they were always going to get even more dficult right toward the end when we are coming to that conclusion.She added that the next seven days ldquoare going to be critical, and said she would be travelling back to Brussels to talk with key figures including Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president ahead of an emergency European Council summit on November .Responding to Mrs Mayrsquos interview, a source in the ERG said: ldquoWe have negotiated in good faith with the iceberg and cannot break our commitments to it..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May takes swipe at Tory critics ahead of  ucritical u week for Brexit article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentSort comments byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...SuspendLast Updated: ReplyQuote  EditDeleteReport wrote:Post reply Save commentCancel Are you sure you want to delete this comment Yes, delete the commentNo, keep the commentReport This CommentThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Stud-1.jpg","title":"plans to build  new homes in co antrim","story":"Posted on Wednesday  November  by John Mulgrew Around , new homes could be built in Co Antrim in one of the largest developments to take place here in the last few years, it can be revealed. Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
