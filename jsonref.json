Crime rates soared sky high with drug dealers and prostitutes openly working the streets of Gotham nonstop and the city was just about in financial ruin. Award-winning photographer Helen M. Stummer took thousands of images showcasing impoverished neighborhoods over her 40-year career. The photo above was captured in 1979 of a young child with his hands over his head staring on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side          Similar scenes of danger and destruction could also be found just across the Hudson River in impoverished neighborhoods like Newark, New Jersey – which at one point was named the worst city of all during the time period. Stummer spent more than a decade in the city capturing run-down areas like the one pictured above on Clinton Avenue and Peshine Avenue in 1982           Stummer, who is a visual sociologist, explained to DailyMail.com that she spent countless hours building relationships with many of the people she focused her lens on. One of those people include the woman pictured above named Shirley, who Stummer often photographed. The image above was taken in 1979 on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side           ‘I stay year in and year out and I become friends with people,’ the 82-year-old said. Stummer\u0027s relationship with Shirley developed with the mother allowing her inside of her home. The photographer captured the above image of Shirley with her twin daughter playing in 1978          Stummer also took her camera along with her to a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1979 in New Jersey (pictured above). At the time, she explained that she worked at a local newspaper as a reporter          Of the experience, she said: ‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’ Pictured above is another photograph from that same KKK rally One of the striking images Stummer captured in 1979 shows children playing in water from a broken fire hydrant while a mother holds her adorable baby girl up to dip her feet in the street water.‘You don’t realize how cold that hydrant water really is. I don’t know how that baby is in the water or any of the children,’ Stummer said of the photo.‘I put my feet in there and it is beyond freezing, honestly it is so cold. But I loved that photo and capturing that moment with the mother, named Shirley, holding the baby who was named Michelle.’She added that she spent a lot of time with Shirley and others in the then-impoverished neighborhood, especially at the Children’s Aide Society, which was located on East 6th Street at the time.‘What I saw at East 6th street, I knew at that moment, it was an intuitive thing a gut thing, that I knew this was the place I wanted to photograph,’ she revealed. ‘And my whole foundation seemed to shift when I experienced that.‘I would go on the street and I became involved with the families. And that’s how you get intimate photographs, you can’t just go in and do it. It doesn’t happen like that you have to spend time and that’s what I did.’But Stummer said she was forced to stop photographing the area around the Children’s Aide Society when she was surrounded by drug dealers who were taking over the community.‘I would go to the Children’s Aide Society and go on the street once or twice a week until the drug dealers told me I had to leave,’ she stated.          Stummer seemingly first kicked off her photography career when she captured hundreds of images showing the Lower East Side thanks to her assignment while she was a student at the International Center of Photography. Pictured above are two young girls holding dolls in front of a building on East 6th Street in 1977          Stummer shared that when she first went out to take photos, she was so scared and her hands shook when she held the camera for the first six months. But eventually she settled into the community and was a regular on the scene. Pictured above is a scene on East 6th Street taken by Stummer in 1980          She also started to venture into Newark, New Jersey in the beginning of the 80s when crime was rampant in the then-impoverished neighborhood. Pictured above is a boy walking in the fog in Newark in 1982 that Stummer captured           She explained that her experiences early on gave her the confidence to go to neighborhoods where most people were scared to step foot in. Pictured above is a young girl named Danielle in 1990 holding a Rainbow Brite doll on the rooftop of her building in Newark           One of the most striking images Stummer captured is above showing three young children playing with dirt near illegally dumped tires outside of their residential building in 1992. ‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen‘1980 the heavy drugs came in and everyone was scared. I mean everyone. One day I was going to the Children’s Aide Society like I usually did and before I knew it there were a bunch of men surrounding me.‘They had the chains and big hats on and seemed like they were nine feet tall because I was so scared. They told me they didn’t want me taking pictures anymore and said if they see me with my camera out one more time, it’s done, it’s over.’Luckily, Stummer escaped from being harmed during the incident and didn’t return back to the area for years.Another image that Stummer captured shows members of the Ku Klux Klan at a 1979 rally in  New Jersey. At the time, Stummer explained that she was working as a reporter at a local newspaper and that she decided to go and take her camera.‘When I saw them, my first reaction was to laugh. I was going to tell them “please this is not Halloween”, but it took only a few short seconds after that thought that my blood went really cold,’ she said of the experience.‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’The 82-year-old New Jersey native also documented Newark’s Central Ward for many years where she became friends with many of her subjects.          Another captivating photo she took shows the boy above named Ali who jumped into her frame at the last second. Stummer said she was focusing her camera on the men behind the boy outside of a building in Newark in 1999          The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit , titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.One of the captivating images she captured in 1992 shows three young children playing in the dirt near tires that were dumped just outside of a their home at 322 Irving Boulevard in Newark.‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen.‘The landlord wouldn’t fix those violations no matter what. What angered me so much is that it was such an injustice that kids had to play in these horrid places.‘They would get rashes and the parents were just so tired. They complained so much but never got anywhere with anything and so many of them were sick and it was just a total injustice to me.’The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit, titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.BBC presenter Louise Minchin prepares for the Slateman triathlonHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pondShocking moment man stabs nurse after being refused medicationMoment a dad was caught on camera teaching a girl how to smokeAnnaliese Dodds \u0027Labour have been consistent over Brexit approach\u0027Singer left red-faced after her skirt blew up in front of audiencePolice rescue kids dragged onto roof by hallucinating momMan walks around with machete in his head before going to hospitalKFC in racism row as black tourists are removed from Berlin eateryShopkeeper catches a man \u0027committing fraud\u0027 on CCTV in WembleyJeremy Corbyn says Brexit cannot have return to hard border"},{"url":null,"title":"When Red Nose Day 2018 USA it","story":"According to the Red Nose Day website, the fundraiser has helped eight million children, with nearly a million of those receiving educational services and 6.79 million getting essential medical services.Red Nose Day also tackles child homelessness and says part of the money has helped nearly 60,000 homeless teens in the US.Orange is the New Black Season 6: All you need to knowFornite launches Playground mode featuring respawns and llamasWhen will Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield appear on Coronation Street? Florence + the Machine tour 2018 dates and tickets information revealedWho was James Wong Howe?

My parents ignited my property bug. When I was in my early 20s they gave me a plot of land next to their home and said I could do what I wanted with it. Battling for planning permission and studying plans allowed me to see the potential for investment. I sold it a few years later at a good profit.We bought a property in Cheshire three years ago for £850,000. I razed the ugly house and started again.We spent £500,000 building our perfect family home — four bedrooms, each with an en suite. It is now worth double what we paid and we love it. We bought the villa in Portugal in 2008 after falling in love with the area while visiting friends and built it from the ground up. It is a two-acre estate. It has four bedrooms, all en suite, with a pool and an outside kitchen and bar. It is worth around €3 million.We rent out the villa when we are not there. A property abroad has to make money for us.

Alex loves to crash there, too.We keep clothes and towels at each property. It allows us to head off to Portugal at short notice, taking just hand luggage.I do have moments at night when I wake up not knowing which home I am in, and wander off to the loo in the wrong direction!Some people who don’t know us can make jealous comments. Those in our social circle know how hard my husband and I have worked for what we have.  Sarah Cross is an interior designer and married mother of five to Oliver, 12 Jonny, ten Eloise, eight and Harry and Lottie, five. The family lives in Cambridge and also have properties in Anglesey and St Lucia. Sarah, 45, says:After a trying day juggling the demands of five children, I like to let my mind wander. It doesn’t have to go too far: just to the beaches of Anglesey or the azure sea of St Lucia. And I can do that — and still be at home!I got on the property ladder after I was awarded financial compensation. I’d been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident in London in 1995.The sum I received just about allowed us to put a deposit on our first property in West London. It was while I was renovating the flat, enjoying experimenting with fabrics and colours, that I realised I could earn a living from design and interiors.          The home is \u0027modern and practical\u0027 with an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living roomI spent my 20s and 30s getting married and having children. Yet during that time I was renovating our next home — another London flat. We sold up and moved to Cambridge in 2013, before our youngest child was born. Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.          Sarah can let her mind wander with guaranteed sunshine at a property in St Lucia (pictured)          The home in Rhoscolyn which they bought in 2015. Sarah had often visited Anglesey as a childThe St Lucia property was an obvious choice because it is somewhere we have loved going and meeting friends for years.With guaranteed sunshine, it’s also a place where my husband can truly switch off.There was land for sale in 2016, so we went for it. It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place.

She has two children Cassie, 32, and Joshua, 33, and a grandson Zae, one. She has homes in Cyprus, Shropshire and Cleethorpes. Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.          Jane Sayce\u0027s two-bedroom ‘log cabin’ retreat in  Shropshire          Jane Sayce\u0027s property in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, a seafront flat bought as an investmentAs soon as I left home at 18, I went to Belgium, where I worked as an au pair before working in hospitality in hotels in Germany and Denmark. When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.

I find the summers too hot in Cyprus, and also it’s closer to Birmingham, where my grown-up children live.The wildlife is stunning I sit on the terrace and wind down while watching geese waddle by or listening to the woodpeckers in the forests.I am already thinking about my future though, which is why I have just snapped up a town property in Cleethorpes. It’s a rather chi-chi seafront flat, which I regard as a great investment. I can see it is somewhere we could both retire to when I eventually sell up.My family are rather proud of me. They know how have worked hard to achieve this. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/00/4BE50C2E00000578-0-image-m-22_1525561470263.jpg","title":"Look Aidan Turner dastardly MP taken shine Demelza","story":"    Heartthrob Ross Poldark carrying his wife Demelza from the sea in the popular BBC1 dramaRoss and his wife have already cheated on each other, with Demelza kissing naval officer Hugh Armitage, played by Burberry model Josh Whitehouse, in the final episode of series three.It came after she was told that Ross had kissed Elizabeth Warleggan, his first love and former fiancee.BBC made me a mincing camp joke but what\u0027s so funny about...If only he\u0027d been selling ice cream too!

We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking.

I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/10/4C9D17C200000578-0-image-m-10_1527240775310.jpg","title":"Sturgeon bids revive floundering Scottish independence campaign","story":"    Nicola Sturgeon (pictured yesterday in te Scottish Parliament) today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027Nicola Sturgeon today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027. The Scottish First Minister is publishing a new report on how independence would work today despite repeated setbacks at the ballot box as voters reject the idea.Ms Sturgeon insisted there was now a \u0027very different political and economic situation\u0027 to when the last referendum was held in 2014. Her report advocates keeping the pound during a transition period after an independence vote - before potentially moving to a new currency. She said: \u0027There is no status quo and we know that being taken out of Europe and out of a market around eight times bigger than the UK market alone will hit our economy.\u0027That is why it is time to begin a fresh debate and to replace the despair of Brexit with optimism about Scotland\u0027s future.\u0027We look forward to debating the report\u0027s recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland.\u0027 Corbyn admits he would NOT fight to keep Britain together in...Share this articleThe Sustainable Growth Commission was set up to look at the future economic prospects of Scotland.The 354-page report will outline that the pound should remain as Scotland\u0027s currency for a period of time after any break from the Union.There has been speculation the country would then move to a new Scottish version of Sterling.

He was later led out in handcuffs and taken to a criminal court where he pleaded not guitly.He posted $1 million cash bail, and was released on condition he wore a GPS bracelet. In December, Damon, landed himself in hot water when he spoke about the #MeToo movement in a series of interview promoting his latest film Downsizing. In one interview with Business Insider, Damon reminded women that not all men in Hollywood were predators.\u0027We\u0027re in this watershed moment, and it\u0027s great, but I think one thing that\u0027s not being talked about is there are a whole s**tload of guys - the preponderance of men I\u0027ve worked with - who don\u0027t do this kind of thing...I don\u0027t do that, and most of the people I know don\u0027t do that,\u0027 he said. In another interview with ABC\u0027s Peter Travers, Damon said it was important to recognize that there is a spectrum of offenses.           Weinstein turned himself in today at a New York police station on sexual misconduct charges          He was later led out in handcuffs and taken to a criminal court where he will be officially charged\u0027I do believe that there\u0027s a spectrum of behavior, right?

Crime rates soared sky high with drug dealers and prostitutes openly working the streets of Gotham nonstop and the city was just about in financial ruin. Award-winning photographer Helen M. Stummer took thousands of images showcasing impoverished neighborhoods over her 40-year career. The photo above was captured in 1979 of a young child with his hands over his head staring on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side          Similar scenes of danger and destruction could also be found just across the Hudson River in impoverished neighborhoods like Newark, New Jersey – which at one point was named the worst city of all during the time period. Stummer spent more than a decade in the city capturing run-down areas like the one pictured above on Clinton Avenue and Peshine Avenue in 1982           Stummer, who is a visual sociologist, explained to DailyMail.com that she spent countless hours building relationships with many of the people she focused her lens on. One of those people include the woman pictured above named Shirley, who Stummer often photographed. The image above was taken in 1979 on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side           ‘I stay year in and year out and I become friends with people,’ the 82-year-old said. Stummer\u0027s relationship with Shirley developed with the mother allowing her inside of her home. The photographer captured the above image of Shirley with her twin daughter playing in 1978          Stummer also took her camera along with her to a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1979 in New Jersey (pictured above). At the time, she explained that she worked at a local newspaper as a reporter          Of the experience, she said: ‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’ Pictured above is another photograph from that same KKK rally One of the striking images Stummer captured in 1979 shows children playing in water from a broken fire hydrant while a mother holds her adorable baby girl up to dip her feet in the street water.‘You don’t realize how cold that hydrant water really is. I don’t know how that baby is in the water or any of the children,’ Stummer said of the photo.‘I put my feet in there and it is beyond freezing, honestly it is so cold. But I loved that photo and capturing that moment with the mother, named Shirley, holding the baby who was named Michelle.’She added that she spent a lot of time with Shirley and others in the then-impoverished neighborhood, especially at the Children’s Aide Society, which was located on East 6th Street at the time.‘What I saw at East 6th street, I knew at that moment, it was an intuitive thing a gut thing, that I knew this was the place I wanted to photograph,’ she revealed. ‘And my whole foundation seemed to shift when I experienced that.‘I would go on the street and I became involved with the families. And that’s how you get intimate photographs, you can’t just go in and do it. It doesn’t happen like that you have to spend time and that’s what I did.’But Stummer said she was forced to stop photographing the area around the Children’s Aide Society when she was surrounded by drug dealers who were taking over the community.‘I would go to the Children’s Aide Society and go on the street once or twice a week until the drug dealers told me I had to leave,’ she stated.          Stummer seemingly first kicked off her photography career when she captured hundreds of images showing the Lower East Side thanks to her assignment while she was a student at the International Center of Photography. Pictured above are two young girls holding dolls in front of a building on East 6th Street in 1977          Stummer shared that when she first went out to take photos, she was so scared and her hands shook when she held the camera for the first six months. But eventually she settled into the community and was a regular on the scene. Pictured above is a scene on East 6th Street taken by Stummer in 1980          She also started to venture into Newark, New Jersey in the beginning of the 80s when crime was rampant in the then-impoverished neighborhood. Pictured above is a boy walking in the fog in Newark in 1982 that Stummer captured           She explained that her experiences early on gave her the confidence to go to neighborhoods where most people were scared to step foot in. Pictured above is a young girl named Danielle in 1990 holding a Rainbow Brite doll on the rooftop of her building in Newark           One of the most striking images Stummer captured is above showing three young children playing with dirt near illegally dumped tires outside of their residential building in 1992. ‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen‘1980 the heavy drugs came in and everyone was scared. I mean everyone. One day I was going to the Children’s Aide Society like I usually did and before I knew it there were a bunch of men surrounding me.‘They had the chains and big hats on and seemed like they were nine feet tall because I was so scared. They told me they didn’t want me taking pictures anymore and said if they see me with my camera out one more time, it’s done, it’s over.’Luckily, Stummer escaped from being harmed during the incident and didn’t return back to the area for years.Another image that Stummer captured shows members of the Ku Klux Klan at a 1979 rally in  New Jersey. At the time, Stummer explained that she was working as a reporter at a local newspaper and that she decided to go and take her camera.‘When I saw them, my first reaction was to laugh. I was going to tell them “please this is not Halloween”, but it took only a few short seconds after that thought that my blood went really cold,’ she said of the experience.‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’The 82-year-old New Jersey native also documented Newark’s Central Ward for many years where she became friends with many of her subjects.          Another captivating photo she took shows the boy above named Ali who jumped into her frame at the last second. Stummer said she was focusing her camera on the men behind the boy outside of a building in Newark in 1999          The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit , titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.One of the captivating images she captured in 1992 shows three young children playing in the dirt near tires that were dumped just outside of a their home at 322 Irving Boulevard in Newark.‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen.‘The landlord wouldn’t fix those violations no matter what. What angered me so much is that it was such an injustice that kids had to play in these horrid places.‘They would get rashes and the parents were just so tired. They complained so much but never got anywhere with anything and so many of them were sick and it was just a total injustice to me.’The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit, titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.BBC presenter Louise Minchin prepares for the Slateman triathlonHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pondShocking moment man stabs nurse after being refused medicationMoment a dad was caught on camera teaching a girl how to smokeAnnaliese Dodds \u0027Labour have been consistent over Brexit approach\u0027Singer left red-faced after her skirt blew up in front of audiencePolice rescue kids dragged onto roof by hallucinating momMan walks around with machete in his head before going to hospitalKFC in racism row as black tourists are removed from Berlin eateryShopkeeper catches a man \u0027committing fraud\u0027 on CCTV in WembleyJeremy Corbyn says Brexit cannot have return to hard border"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/20/4C9648DD00000578-5768113-image-a-1_1527188534350.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment woman runs safety cows cause havoc residential street","story":"    A startled woman (on left circled in red) runs away as the herd approaches in the town of Stone, Staffordshire          The cows happily peer through windows and munch on grass on a resident\u0027s driveway          This cow was very curious to see what was going on in a resident\u0027s living roomFarmer Matthew Weaver, 41, who owns Aston Lodge Farm, said it appeared his herd had decided they wanted to get \u0027a closer look at their human neighbours\u0027.\u0027If something isn\u0027t 100 per cent secure, they can be very good at escaping.

Sheila Heti talks about self-belief and the joy of failureHer deeply personal first novel ided critics, her new one explores the choice not to have children. Sheila Heti talks about self-belief and the joy of failureWhen Sheila Heti’s novel, Motherhood, was published in the US, many of the reviews opened with personal experiences. The book, which describes a female writer in her late 30s (in many ways indistinguishable from Heti) reaching a decision not to have children, is a sometimes frenzied, sometimes laconic, often very funny meditation on the ambivalent state in which many women find themselves in their late 30s, and has been received in a way that rather grimly underscores the themes of the novel: that a great many women take other women’s decisions about motherhood as a direct rebuke to their own. If a review starts along the lines of “when I had my first child … ” you know Heti is in for a rough time.At 41, the author herself is no longer agonised part of the purpose of writing the book was to get over the decision: “It’s a scary thing to look into,” she says. We are in a hotel in downtown Manhattan, where she is staying while visiting from her native Toronto. She is slight, her voice infused with a levity that has been lost in much of the commentary around Motherhood and that is a central quality of Heti’s writing, from 2005’s Ticknor, her first novel, to 2010’s How Should a Person Be?Motherhood is in some ways a more avant garde project than the other books, somewhat formless, necessarily obsessive, rigorously limited to the question at hand, and at the same time by far the most mainstream of her novels. Ticknor, for example, is about the relationship between two relatively obscure 19th-century writers, William Hickling Prescott and George Ticknor. Even choosing to write about motherhood, or in Heti’s case the decision not to become a mother, is a source of anxiety and shame, and I say that as someone who has just written a book about having kids. “I had that feeling of embarrassment, too,” says Heti. “Like, am I really going to do this? And why? It’s such a huge, monumental, essence-of-life topic. We all have mothers. Why is this chick-lit? Or – I don’t know exactly what the feeling about it is.” She bursts into laughter.When the novel opens, the Heti character is 36 and living with her boyfriend who has a child from a previous relationship and doesn’t want any more, but informs her she’s welcome to try to persuade him. Meanwhile she’s not even sure she can persuade herself. But – and this was part of Heti’s purpose in writing the novel – it seemed important not to sleepwalk through the decision.“That was the one thing I really didn’t want for myself which was to let it happen to me. And I think for a lot of people, that would be their preference. I have a friend who was like, I can have a baby, it’s no big deal, it’s just so burdensome the idea that I have to think about it. For me it was like, I don’t think I could live with myself if I wasn’t thoughtful about it.”And yet for many women, it is a decision over which, I think, they assume they have limited control. “Yes, they say the superstitious thing of ‘let life happen’. Well, I’m sure those women didn’t do that in every aspect of their lives. Those are people who know how to get what they want. It’s hard to say you don’t want it. It’s like you don’t even believe yourself when you say that.”Some of the criticism around Motherhood has taken on a chiding quality and of course, as Heti points out, “women are as bad as men about all this policing”. Rather than simply railing against the impertinent judgment of others, Heti, in the novel, takes the much more subtle approach of mourning what is lost when someone finds themselves at odds with the mainstream. “There is a kind of sadness in not wanting the things that give so many other people their life’s meaning,” she writes. “There can be sadness at not living out a more universal story – the supposed life cycle.”There is shame attached to not wanting children, Heti says. But I also felt shame for the fierceness with which I wanted kids. “Maybe there’s a basic shame women feel and it just attaches to anything,” she says, laughing. “It’s kind of how I feel about anxiety when you’re an anxious person like I am, I realised at a certain point, it’s not the thing I’m feeling anxious about that is making me anxious, it’s that I have a feeling of anxiety and it attaches to whatever it can. Maybe if we both feel shame it’s because it’s shameful to be a woman. Whatever you choose you feel shame.” She pauses and drily adds, “I wonder if it’s ever going to change, or if women will feel that way until there are no humans ever.”For many years, Heti worked remotely as an editor and writer for the Believer magazine, the literary journal based in San Francisco. She functions best, she says, when she has more than one project on the go and can find relief from one by picking up another. “I just like working. And each is a different kind of work. Sometimes you can’t write a novel for weeks and weeks, but it’s good for your self-esteem to work on something else.” She gave up the Believer when she started putting together Women in Clothes, an anthology of photos, interviews and stories that amounted to a “conversation among hundreds of women” about why we wear what we wear, which she assembled with two writer friends, Heidi Julavits and Leanne Shapton.Every one of Heti’s books has erged radically from what came before, and yet her work is recognisable for the consistency of its humour, and for her desire to get at the truth via unconventional means. She is suspicious of the boundary between fiction and non-fiction. The details of Motherhood are largely autobiographical but the register is fictional. “I don’t know what that line is between fiction and non-fiction that other people have in their minds, but to me when I’m writing it’s just like whatever the next sentence should be is the next sentence. It’s not this artificial ision.”There is a good section in Motherhood about the value of failure, not in the Samuel Beckett sense of fail again, fail better, but in the true wildness of failing in a society that puts so much value on success. “Only in our failures are we absolutely alone,” writes Heti. “Only in the pursuit of failure can a person really be free.” She concludes, “Losers may be the avant garde of the modern age.”She finds failure interesting. For a while, she wondered if she should move to New York, but “I just write better in Toronto than I do anywhere else”, she says. She is wary of what living in New York does to people, “where the bourgeois ideal is so oppressive, and everywhere you look is what you’re supposed to be living up to. The food you eat, everything. There’s no space where you’re not performing. In your bedroom, that lamp or whatever. I like that idea of pursuing failure. It’s just such a relief.”Heti’s writing has been successful. Her novels are the subject of long, serious disquisitions in the New Yorker, where How Should a Person Be? prompted one critic to say of the author: “This talented writer may well have identified a central dialectic of 21st-century postmodern being.” But she has experienced failure in her personal life, she says, notably a short-lived marriage in her mid-20s. She has lived with her boyfriend Lucas, a criminal attorney, for many years, but for a long time she considered her ambivalence towards wanting to have children as an abject failure.She thinks differently now and the way she talks about it is very persuasive. “If there is a longing for babies that women feel, as I’ve heard it described, this very deep yearning, that must be biological – then wouldn’t not feeling it also be biological? There’s always been people in society who don’t have babies this idea of alloparents. It’s a Margaret Mead, anthropological idea, of all these cultures throughout history that have had so-called alloparents, people who help parents raise their children, but are not themselves parents. Aunts, uncles – there is a need in society for people without children. So if there is also a need for children, then maybe some people are given that urge and some people are not. It’s symbiotic.”And yet, as she points out, everyone is subjected to the same “pressure to do it”, so much so that “there is this feeling if you decide not to have children where you want to just tell people, so they stop expecting that of you. And then you also want to tell yourself, so you don’t go on feeling like you’re expecting it of yourself, or like you have to constantly contend with it.”Somewhere in those years between 35 and 40, what Heti realised she really wanted was to throw everything she had at being an artist. Her writing explores the far reaches of experimental fiction, an all-consuming and energy-inefficient way to write, given the amount of material she ends up throwing out. One of the books she had on the back burner while writing Motherhood grew out of Heti alphabetising her diaries – “so it’s like 120,000 words, but the sentences are arranged in alphabetical order. So, all the sentences that start with a, and then b.”How do you even germinate an idea like that?“It came out of a really specific place. I keep diaries, and I keep them on my computer, and I was wondering how much repetition there is in my thoughts. Am I having the same thoughts this year that I was having six years ago? Has anything changed? So I thought that the way to find out would be to see how many times certain sentences repeat how many times did I write ‘I hate him’ or whatever. So I loaded them into Excel and did a whole bunch of tech stuff. It didn’t end up answering that question for me, but that was the start.”She has a publisher interested, but Heti isn’t yet sure whether “I want this in the world, or just for me. I’ve sent it to friends.” This is the grey area out of which so many of her books emerge, a determination to write herself out of an indeterminate state, or what in Motherhood she calls “mush”. “Just give me a form,” she says now. “Let my life have a form. Any form.”It is strange to consider that something as interior and literary as this novel might be used as self-help, but I think it will. It finds the commonality of experience on both sides of the baby ide, in a way that, given how toxic and reductive the subject can be, restores dignity to both. “I hope so,” says Heti. After all, she points out, a novel “doesn’t have a stake in your life like everyone else you know does.” She smiles. “Who should help you if not books?”• Motherhood is published by Harvill Secker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b4cb58fa8ab7b6b949e4726ad36910e523a44a/23_138_2423_1454/master/2423.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc34f59f6ed002c9c9367a9c90aa346","title":"flotation of saudi oil giant aramco likely to be delayed until 2019","story":"Saudi energy minister hints that record-breaking Aramco IPO is running behind scheduleThe stock market flotation of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company is likely to be delayed until next year, according to the country’s energy minister, confirming mounting speculation that the world’s biggest IPO was running behind schedule.In January the firm lauded a royal decree converting Saudi Aramco into a joint stock company, a key step allowing it to have more shareholders than its existing one, the Saudi kingdom.However, industry watchers have been increasingly sceptical that the timeline was likely to be kept, with British officials saying recently that the 2018 target would be missed. Doubts have also been fuelled by the lack so far of any prospectus for investors.On Friday, the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, appeared to officially confirm a delay. “Most likely it will be in 2019 but we will not know until the announcement has been made,” he told a conference in St Petersburg. “The timing I think will depend on the readiness of the market, rather than the readiness of the company or the readiness of Saudi Arabia,” said Falih, who added that the company was ready.The IPO of Saudi Aramco is a crucial part of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030”, a plan to ersify the country’s economy away from oil.One sign that London is a frontrunner to host the flotation is that Saudi Aramco has engaged a reputation firm to see what “key stakeholders” think of the firm.On Friday the Saudi-dominated oil cartel Opec and Russia signalled the beginning of the end for their production cuts.Oil prices recently hit $80 a barrel, in part because of the Opec curbs but also because of the US reimposing sanctions on Iran and production falling in crisis-stricken Venezuela. The oil cartel is under pressure from the US, China and India to stabilise prices. Donald Trump said in April: “Opec is at it again.” He tweeted: “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Opec’s secretary general, Mohammad Barkindo, said on Friday that the tweet had sparked a discussion about easing production cuts. “We pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo said.Sources told Reuters that Opec and Russia are likely to increase production by about 1 million barrels a day. The news resulted in oil prices falling back to $77.Experts said the market had flipped quickly over the past six months from a world awash in oil to one where there are concerns over supplies. The analyst said the signals from the Saudis and Russians made the prospect of oil hitting $100 a barrel – as the French oil giant Total recently said was possible – less likely. Gelder said a meeting of Opec and Russia next month would likely result in them agreeing to increase production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d97bdf120b1a4cc4c11e36cc72a6d6a854e30e5/0_400_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cc08dd9577de03c2e4ebd1aa0ccfa1","title":"stacey cunningham nyse first female president wall street","story":"Stacey Cunningham’s appointment as NYSE president raises hopes that the glass ceiling has finally cracked on Wall StreetStacey Cunningham, who began her career as a summer intern on the New York stock exchange 24 years ago, will become the first woman to head the 226-year-old financial market on Friday, an appointment that raises hopes that the glass ceiling may have finally cracked on Wall Street.But has it? Cunningham takes up the position as the financial services sector is struggling to show it has moved beyond the cliches of Wall Street’s sexist culture.Little epitomized Wall Street better than the pre-digitized NYSE – at the time the now 43-year-old Cunningham joined she was one of just three dozen women among more than 1,000 men.When she first arrived, Cunningham recalled last year, the women’s restroom on the seventh floor was inside an old phone booth. Men, she said, had a “palatial” bathroom next door with couches and a full-time attendant. But while Cunningham has her work cut continuing to modernize NYSE’s trading operations and induce more companies to list publicly, Wall Street itself is eager to show it is on the path to gender parity. In a symbolic gesture, city authorities led by New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, moved the Fearless Girl, a statue commissioned to stare down the 7,000lb Charging Bull of Wall Street, to a spot outside the exchange. In interviews, Cunningham has acknowledged the women who came before her, among them Muriel Siebert, a Wall Street legend as the first woman to join the exchange as a trader in 1967.“I was a woman trader on the floor, and I never thought about it – I never thought for a moment whether or not that could happen, and whether or not that was an opportunity available to me,” Cunningham told the Street in March. “And it’s because Muriel paved the way. I think it’s just really important to recognize that any time a woman pushes the boundaries and redefines the boundaries, she’s redefining them for everyone else that follows her.”But to some ways of thinking, celebrating Cunningham is itself a testament to how few women achieve top leadership positions on Wall Street. Two weeks ago, the Campbell Soup CEO, Denise Morrison, abruptly stepped down, triggering hand-wringing that her departure left just 23 women as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, a drop from 32 in 2016.Morrison followed a number of other high-profile women out of the door, including Meg Whitman at Hewlett-Packard, Irene Rosenfeld of Mondēlez, Sheri McCoy of Avon and Margo Georgiadis at Mattel. On the plus side, there is still Mary Barra at General Motors, Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin, Ginni Rometty at IBM and Indra Nooyi at Pepsi. But according to Kathryn Kolbert, founder and outgoing director of the Athena Center for Leadership Studies at Barnard College, the fact that we still count arrivals and departures of female executives is testament to how much remains to be done. “If you look at the pace of change it’ll take another 100 years to get to parity.” “Yet we know that having women at high levels of leadership not only improves the bottom line but makes a company much more creative, innovative and responsive to its clients, yet I don’t see a significant change in the numbers of women at high levels of leadership at financial services companies,” Kolbert said.In Kolbert’s view, improving gender equality is a question of will.“It’s not hard to do. We know that when a senior member of a Fortune company wants change, it happens and it happens quickly. I have long believed companies not only need to see the advantage, but need the will to make the change.”That corresponds with the thinking of Elissa Ellis Sangster, executive director of the Forté Foundation, a group that helps guide women in business. Sangster told the  she too found it “frustrating” that we’re still celebrating when women are named to top positions. “You’d think by now the pipeline would be 50-50 and we’d see enough women in one-level-down positions who are ready and able to helm some of these top companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a7412888415c40f76043d3606de3424820d8c45/0_220_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38d0a829be875986aecebfde6f2041f","title":"uk economy posts worst quarterly gdp figures for five years","story":"The weakest household spending for three years and falling levels of business investment dragged the economy to the worst quarter for five years, official statisticians have said. The latest figures will further stoke concerns over the strength of the UK economy, amid increasing signals for deteriorating growth as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. Some economists, including officials at the Bank of England, thought the growth rate would be revised higher as more data became available.Threadneedle Street delayed raising interest rates earlier this month after the weak first GDP estimate, despite arguing that the negative hit to the economy from heavy snowfall in late February and early March had probably been overblown. Instead the ONS said it had seen a longer-term pattern of slowing growth in the first three months of the year.Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said: “Overall, the economy performed poorly in the first quarter, with manufacturing growth slowing and weak consumer-facing services.”While admitting bad weather will have had some impact, particularly for firms in the construction industry and some areas of the retail business, statisticians said the overall effect was limited, with increased online sales and heightened energy production during the cold snap. Much will now hinge on how consumers fare over the coming months, with some early indications there could be a rebound in stronger retail sales data for April.

But they never reckoned with reality, and now it’s biting“Fantasy” is the right word for British politics as spring sputters into summer, with Brexit’s chariot hurrying near. Not the good kind, mind you. Rather than a pleasant daydream, we’re dealing instead with collective delusion, in which cabinet ministers, walled off from reality, waste weeks debating customs plans that the EU has already rejected.So it’s not surprising that a senior EU figure has dismissed the government’s entire approach to the negotiations as make believe. “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa,” the official said, “I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.” As if to underline the point, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, issued his own warning about the increasing likelihood of a “disruptive Brexit”.In one sense the paralysis on the UK side is understandable. All of the options are bad. The boss of HMRC told MPs this week that so-called “max-fac” would cost £20bn a customs partnership would cost £3bn. The only no-cost solution – remaining in the customs union and single market – has already been rejected on the basis that the public hates EU regulations like the ban on mobile phone roaming charges, and loves free trade deals, with their promise of chlorinated chicken and expensive medicines for all. Even as they publicly trumpet the benefits of their preferred plans, it’s hard to imagine the ministers involved are not privately frightened to take the plunge. Every course of action will result in increased poverty and bureaucracy. Hence the deadlock, hence the retreat into fantasy.For some, however, Brexit isn’t the problem. It’s the helpless flapping of politicians that is ruining everything. If only they were less craven, less factious, less captured by the Whitehall system. Then everything might have been alright.Dominic Cummings, who led the official Vote Leave campaign, published an open letter to Tory MPs and donors this week. He took the government to task, accusing them of having “botched” Brexit by triggering article 50 without adequate preparation. “This immediately closed many positive branching histories and created major problems,” he wrote. He further complains that “The government promised … to do a number of things that are logically, legally and practically incompatible including leaving the single market and customs union, avoiding ‘friction’ and changing nothing around the Irish border (as defined by the EU), and having no border in the Irish Sea.” Cummings is an intriguing character – he was described by David Cameron as a “career psychopath” and has a reputation as an extremely clever but irascible free-thinker. (He’s going to be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a film about the referendum). What’s less often recognised is that he is a utopian, someone for whom reality just isn’t good enough. And his “vision” of a revolution in governance played a not insignificant part in creating the dystopia in which we currently languish.He backed leave because he wanted to “break the system open”, and believed “alternatives to the EU and UN are vital if we are to develop the international cooperation on big problems that we need”. Britain could lead the way. Those “positive branching histories” are the possible routes to a new Jerusalem he believed Brexit could open up. The roads the country’s leaders could take if they were equal to the challenge and grasped the nature of the prize.The problem is they were always vastly outnumbered by “negative branching histories”. We have the system we have. That doesn’t mean it can’t be changed. But the chances of it being swept away in a tsunami of enlightenment are negligible. No matter how much you might wish it otherwise, many of our successful politicians will also be craven and factious. Faced with the complexity of unravelling 40 years of legal, political and economic cooperation, the UK government was always going to stumble. Theresa May, or whoever else became PM, would naturally come under intense political pressure to trigger article 50 quickly. A split vote was always going to mean there would be no mandate for revolutionary change. In other words: Brexit could only have worked as a utopian fantasy. As a project in reality, it was doomed from the start.I don’t know why Cummings et al failed to reckon with these realities. Maybe they thought the gamble, even with those odds, was worth it. But that’s reckless, and brings to mind Isaiah Berlin quoting Alexander Herzen: “Do you truly wish to condemn the human beings alive today to the sad role of caryatids supporting a floor for others some day to dance on?”Because we have been condemned – to lower standards of living, less consumer protection, less cooperation in the fields of science, the environment and diplomacy. And Cummings’ blame game seems a bit of a fantasy itself, given that it was his idea of “perfect” that turned out to be the enemy of what was good for the rest of us.

Who knew dealing with North Korea was so hard? Well, just about everybody. Everybody except Trump, that is.Trump’s cancellation of the 12 June summit meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reaffirms that Trump and his team don’t have a North Korea strategy. And when you’re dealing with a nuclear-armed rogue regime like North Korea, that’s dangerous.The lack of strategy has been apparent for a while. After threatening war for months, Trump reversed course in March. Following a diplomatic thaw between North and South Korea around the Olympics, Trump announced an unprecedented summit meeting with Kim Jong-un. In the months since, Trump began setting expectations of historic things to come. He spoke of Kim as an “honorable” man. He fanned talk of getting the Nobel peace prize. The White House even printed commemorative coins for the summit.The euphoria wore off quickly. In response to US threats of regime change if diplomacy failed, North Korea returned to its usual heated rhetoric, singling out Vice-President Mike Pence and the national security adviser, John Bolton, for criticism. But these statements were likely part of the negotiations – in addition to the boilerplate criticism, North Korea also explicitly reaffirmed Pyongyang’s commitment to dialogue. This was North Korea’s opening position.And yet, Trump and his advisers responded by cancelling the summit. Why? The North Koreans, South Koreans and many Trump advisers are likely scratching their heads along with the rest of us. When the going gets tough, apparently Trump runs away. The Trump team is trying to spin this as North Korea’s fault. But it’s clear that all along US officials have been – rightly – skeptical that North Korea is actually willing to give up its nuclear weapons and many doubted the wisdom of the summit. No one – not North Korea, South Korea, nor Trump’s own team – expected him to announce a summit with Kim Jong-un when the South Koreans came to brief Trump on their talks with Kim in March. But Trump rushed ahead. For some in the administration, cancelling the summit prevents Trump from accepting what they believe is a bad deal. It’s possible that the Trump team views cancellation as a negotiating tactic – Trump and Pompeo have both said talks are still possible. But a more likely explanation is that Trump is thin-skinned, and the repeated insults from North Korea offended Trump and were used by US officials who were skeptical of the diplomacy to torpedo it. Reports indicating that this decision happened very quickly – with no prior notification of allies – suggest that, once again, Trump was winging it. So, what happens next? If Trump wants to return to the “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions and “fire and fury” threats, he’ll quickly realize that it’s dead for now. China has already been easing up on the pressure and will now use Trump’s cancelation of talks to justify further loosening the screws. If Trump really wants to start this process over again, he’ll have to begin hitting China with significant secondary sanctions while he’s trying to negotiate massive trade issues. This theory also rests on the Trump team’s assumption that the “maximum pressure” forced Kim to the table. Kim’s interest in diplomacy was at most only partially fueled by the pressure: he had already achieved the ability to launch nuclear-tipped missiles to the United States and could negotiate from a position of strength. Kim also knew that Seoul was interested in diplomacy and saw an opportunity to ide the United States and South Korea.If Trump wants to return to threats of war – as he did in announcing his decision to cancel the summit – then he still faces the fact that war would be “catastrophic”, as Trump’s secretary of defense, James Mattis, put it. If Trump is still interested in diplomacy – as he should be – then Trump just made his task a lot harder. South Korea was not notified about the decision – they will be angry, and rightly so. And the world will see Trump as the one who stopped the talks, not Kim. Unfortunately for the United States, Kim now holds more cards than he did when the diplomacy began and he knows it – sure enough, North Korea’s first response was to take the high ground and say they’re ready to talk “any time”.There very well may still be a path forward, but only if the Trump administration recognizes that a quick denuclearization process is a fantasy – and if they are willing to give diplomacy time to work. A continuation of the already ongoing high-level talks would test whether progress in limiting or reducing – if not eliminating – North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs was possible. Like a boyfriend expressing hope of getting back together with his girlfriend while breaking up with her, Trump ended his letter to Kim by stating forlornly: “If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.” If diplomacy does get back on track, let’s all hope both sides of this relationship go in eyes wide open next time.

Now in her late 20s, she talks about directing her Potter peers and her new AS Byatt AdaptationAn unassuming hairdressing salon in a shopping precinct in Lincoln is an unlikely venue for the world premiere of a film directed by a globally famous actor. But behind a velvet rope, between the washbasins, that is exactly what is happening in Sincil Salon in Sincil Street in Lincoln town centre. The film is called Medusa’s Ankles, and the director is Bonnie Wright – better known to tens of millions as Ginny Weasley in the Harry Potter film series.The venue, in fact, is wholly appropriate: Medusa’s Ankles, adapted from a short story by AS Byatt, is set entirely in a hairdresser’s. It stars Kerry Fox as a woman disconcerted by the signs of ageing – particularly her greying hair, which she is determined to keep “natural” – and Jason Isaacs as a charismatic, bullying hairdresser with whom she has a fraught, fractious relationship. The 20-minute film is showing over three days in the salon, which will be open for normal hairdressing operation throughout.“What’s so great about this,” says Wright, “is that we spend so much time experiencing things on the internet and social media that an actual physical film screening is rare.” Wright also says she likes the “exhibition-y” feel of the event, which appears as much a gallery installation as a cinema premiere. The screening has been organised by Lincoln-based Mansions of the Future, a three-year cultural project designed to “allow the public to collaborate directly with artists” future events include a new production with nonprofessional actors of Steven Berkoff’s 2001 play Ritual in Blood, about the medieval “blood libel” surrounding Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. Wright very much approves of Mansions of the Future’s aim to bring culture to the people: “I was very lucky to have grown up in London and had that access to the arts. The way I got into this was through culture and education, and it’s so important to take it outside of the capital city.”Wright, 27, bears little resemblance to the pale-faced schoolgirl we last saw settling down to raise a family with Harry Potter (after helping to see off Voldemort’s army at the climactic Battle of Hogwarts). Since finishing the series eight years ago in 2010, she has opted to develop a career largely behind the camera, directing short films, shooting music videos and art projects and recently branching out into commercials. Unlike her fellow Potter alumni, Wright has taken only a few acting jobs since, opting instead to study film-making at the London College of Communication and setting up her own production company in 2012.Medusa’s Ankles has an unlikely subject for a film-maker in her late 20s: a woman experiencing a menopausal midlife crisis. “It’s something I am obviously yet to experience!” she says. “But I think I and a lot of people can understand it: we’ve all sat in a hair salon and been at the mercy of someone else’s opinion. Sometimes you go in knowing exactly what you want, other times it’s about what they think you should have. The story – and the film – is about that sensory interaction, that heightened space between the hairdresser and their client.”The film, she says, is also partly intended as a showcase for how she can handle larger sets and complex lighting setups (“It’s definitely strategic”), and she has her sights set on a full-length feature film. Wright is a committed activist for environmental causes, and is working on a script that, she says, is “heavily inspired by the work I’ve been doing with Greenpeace around ocean plastics, but with a mythological and science fiction twist”.Wright is keen to show she has moved on from Potter, but acknowledges the debt she owes to the role she secured as a nine-year-old after her older brother Lewis suggested she go along to an open casting call. “At the beginning I was in complete awe of whole thing,” she says. “All of us were pretty much learning about film-making and acting as it was happening. It was only as the films developed and the characters became more complex that it became more like a job. Looking back, what I loved about those films is that everyone, from the cinematographer to the set designer, were at the top of their field. To watch people for whom the craft of film-making was so important – that stayed with me.”She also credits the Potter films for pushing her towards writing and directing: “Doing such big films gave me a desire to get more out of film-making, to get deeper into the process. When you are acting you are observing so much happening around you. I am directing actors having been directed myself, and there is specific type of language you have that is so unique. If you’ve been on the other side of it, it’s such a lovely experience.”Wright has not been shy about putting her industry contacts to good use. Her graduation film, a 10-minute drama about a small girl who befriends a bereaved older man, featured David Thewlis, who played Remus Lupin in the Potter films and the star of her second film, a poetic piece about a young man dealing with the death of a lover, was Christian Coulson, who played the teenage Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Isaacs, in her new film, is another Potter regular, having played Lucius Malfoy in six of the films.“For sure, I have an advantage in terms of the access to these people,” she says, “as well as to the experiences I’ve had along the way. But respecting that is really important. If you are going to call upon actors or connections, it’s important not to utilise them when they are not needed. Only if the actor would be right for the role, rather than choosing them for the sake of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf626a0342f27a6c9c951443c2938b7c19e9c655/0_136_4048_2429/master/4048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c31e4fa9631821efae3a5bef9ccfbdb","title":"harvey weinstein books something wonderful elia kazan","story":"The disgraced mogul was seen clutching two hardbacks on his way to hand himself over to the authorities. What does this reading matter suggest about his state of mind? On his way to turn himself into police over sexual assault charges, Harvey Weinstein was filmed carrying three sizeable books, two of which have been identified as Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution by Todd S Purdum, and Elia Kazan: A Biography by Richard Schickel.Something Wonderful was published last month to some acclaim, and it is easy to imagine Weinstein might see something of himself in the story of successful showmen impresarios credited with changing the cultural landscape. But it is the second of these that has caused a considerable stir. Kazan was the Greek-American director of groundbreaking, award-winning classics such as On the Waterfront and A Streetcar named Desire, and a pioneer of socially engaged, “method acting” drama in Hollywood. Born in what was then known as Constantinople and briefly a member of the Communist party in the mid-1930s, Kazan established himself in the left-leaning Group Theatre, directing the premiere production of Arthur Miller’s celebrated Death of a Salesman in 1949. Kazan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) in 1952, at the height of the Hollywood blacklist, and named a number of industry figures – including playwright Clifford Odets and actor Morris Carnovsky – as communists, and effectively helping to end their careers.Weinstein will no doubt see parallels with his own situations, as Kazan was scorned by much of liberal Hollywood as a result of his testimony. The subject matter of One the Waterfront, in which Marlon Brando’s dock-worker chooses to testify against brutal, conformity-enforcing unions, is often seen as Kazan’s justification of his actions in front of Huac. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, with an introduction by fellow director Martin Scorsese, dozens of audience members chose not to applaud and 250 demonstrators picketed the event.Schickel’s 2005 biography also documents Kazan’s extensive womanising. Three times married, he also had affairs with female actors and leading ladies including Marilyn Monroe. British actor Carol Drinkwater alleged Kazan sexually assaulted her during an audition for the 1973 adaptation of the F Scott Fitzgerald novel The Last Tycoon, when she was in her 20s and he was in his 60s. “He came in, threw me back on the sofa and started pulling at my clothes, forcibly trying to have sex with me,” she wrote.Kazan’s reputation as a formidable Hollywood artist weathered political and personal scandals. After his Huac testimony, he won a best director Oscar for On the Waterfront and a best dramatic film award at Cannes for East of Eden, both in 1955, and went on to make a string of acclaimed films, including the Oscar-nominated Splendor in the Grass in 1961 and America America in 1963."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f1951d2b8e64e6a2f3e03d464eade8220f582f/880_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f53c25e06b466c4948f85da08b7fdbe7","title":"james bond danny boyle and daniel craig confirmed for 007s 25th outing","story":"Producers confirm Trainspotting director to take the reins on 25th James Bond film – and Craig’s fifth – with Universal replacing Sony as co-distributorsAfter years of rumour and speculation, Daniel Craig’s return to the role of James Bond – and Danny Boyle’s appointment as director of the new 007 movie – have been confirmed.Production will begin at the start of December 2018, with the film released in the UK on 25 October 2019 and in the US a fortnight later. “We are delighted to announce that the exceptionally talented Danny Boyle will be directing Daniel Craig in his fifth outing as James Bond in the 25th instalment of the franchise,” said EON Productions’ Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the custodians of the Bond movies, in a statement on Friday.“We will begin shooting Bond 25 at Pinewood Studios in December with our partners at MGM and are thrilled that Universal will be our international distributor.”Universal’s involvement marks a change: in the UK, Sony Pictures have previously handled distribution. MGM will still release in the US, in partnership with Annapurna Pictures, the highly-respected outfit owned by Megan Ellison, which has bankrolled films by the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze and David O Russell.In March, Boyle – who is currently shooting a Richard Curtis comedy in the UK – said he was working on a Bond script, with a view to filming at the end of the year. The writer of Bond 25, John Hodge, is a long-time collaborator of Boyle’s, having worked with him on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle’s debut, Shallow Grave.Also rumoured to return to the franchise are Ben Whishaw, who plays gadgets expert Q, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny and Rory Kinnear as Tanner.Whishaw recently greeted rumours of Boyle’s involvement enthusiastically. “I just think it’s really exciting to have Danny Boyle on board for Bond,” he said.“I’m just really excited to work with him, I’ve been such a big fan. It seems weird to talk about it because I’ve not had a conversation with him but it’s exciting.”Craig’s involvement was cast into doubt after he expressed a preference for slashing his own wrists rather than returning to the role while promoting Spectre in 2015. Candidates mooted to replace him included Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner.In 2016, Sam Mendes ruled himself out of future movies having directed both Spectre and Skyfall (2012). Later that year, Craig was reportedly offered $150m for two more Bond movies by Broccoli. The collaboration of Broccoli and Donna Langley, the British chairman of Universal Pictures, brings together two of the most powerful women in cinema. Speaking to the  in February, Rosamund Pike, who played a Bond girl in 2002’s Die Another Day opposite Pierce Brosnan, credited Broccoli with creating a strikingly protective on-set environmentShe said: “At 22, when I was on the Bond set – one of the potentially most chauvinist productions you could imagine – it could have been a very vulnerable place for a young actress to step into her first major role and it wasn’t.”Said said MGM’s chairman of the board of directors Kevin Ulrich: “Under the leadership of Michael and Barbara, we couldn’t be more thrilled than to bring the next 007 adventure to the big screen uniting the incomparable Daniel Craig with the extraordinary vision of Danny Boyle.”Added MGM films president Jonathan Glickman: “It has been 16 years since Die Another Day was distributed by MGM and it’s incredibly gratifying to be releasing this film alongside the powerhouse team at Universal.”Said Langley: “Universal is extremely proud to collaborate with Michael, Barbara and MGM on the international marketing and distribution of Bond 25. The unparalleled combination of Danny’s innovative filmmaking and Daniel’s embodiment of 007 ensured we simply had to be partners in the next chapter of this iconic series.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c9af314e3de3e680e1120044d0dbbef98ec12d/0_210_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2346803af66284c0814954512955c152","title":"arsenal talks stephan lichtsteiner juventus unai emery","story":"Arsenal are in talks to sign Stephan Lichtsteiner on a free when his contract at Juventus expires this summer, with the right-back among Unai Emery’s targets.

Rodgers wanted to use him as part-exchange in a deal for Clint Dempsey.James Milner Relishes his Boring James Milner tag and known as Milly the Machine by Jürgen Klopp for the ground he covers.

This woman suddenly wasn’t Mum any more. Then I felt deceived and angryI was 24 and had just finished my undergraduate degree when, out of the blue, my elderly Greek mother announced that she had something to tell me. “But you look busy, so I’ll tell you later…” I said, “Mum, if you’ve got something to say, tell me now.”She was nervous and asked me to sit down, but I refused. I thought she was going to tell me somebody was dying. Instead, she revealed that she was not my biological mother. Her brother, one of my many uncles, a man I’d never met, who lived in northern Greece, was my real father. I slumped against the wall in shock. By the end, I was splayed on the floor.I’d always known my parents, who had settled in Canberra, Australia, struggled to have children. They’d tried for 17 years and had three miscarriages. When Mum had to go back to Greece in 1973 to visit her sick father, Dad said, “Why don’t you see if you can get a baby from an orphanage in Thessaloniki?” But it didn’t work out. My uncle must have seen how sad she was. He proposed that he and his wife have a baby for her. They already had two sons, George and Billy, who were 10 and 11, and said their child-rearing years were behind them.It was to be a pure gift, but Mum was scared her brother and his wife might want to keep the child: there was nothing in writing. Still, she agreed, went back to Australia and waited. One day, she got a letter. It said: “We’re pregnant. The baby will be born in June 1974.” She flew back early, but missed the birth by a day or two.Mum spent five months in Greece, looking after me and doing the paperwork. My birth certificate was issued with my adoptive name and listed my adoptive parents as my parents. We left for Australia when I was six months old. It must have been difficult for my biological parents to give me up. George later told me that when I was taken away, it was like a period of mourning – nobody talked for three days.After that, we just got on with life. I had a happy childhood, but always felt conspicuous – as the only Greek child at school, and with no siblings. But I was everything to my parents and I looked enough like them not to question it.Mum said they’d been waiting until I finished my degree to tell me they didn’t want to derail my studies. When I said I was going to do a PhD, they didn’t want four more years with the burden of that secret. It was causing them sleepless nights. They were scared they’d die and I’d never know the truth. Dad left it to Mum to tell me as it was her side of the family he wasn’t one for talking much.Mum became teary as she told me, but by the end she seemed lighter. She was glad I’d found out from her. I felt shock at first. This woman suddenly wasn’t Mum any more. Then I felt deceived and angry. But after that came excitement that I had brothers. I wanted to call up all my old friends and tell them: “Remember that kid you went to school with who had no siblings? I’ve suddenly got two!”My biological mother had died in 1993. My mum felt guilty that she’d denied me the chance to meet her. I wondered at the time why her sister-in-law’s death affected her so much, but now it made sense. My biological father was still alive when I discovered the truth, but he died two years later, before I had a chance to meet him. I question why I didn’t travel to see him straight away, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do it. In truth, I didn’t want to get to know another set of parents.When I finally went to Greece in 2003 to meet my brothers, I told Mum she had to come with me. She’d been the architect of this, so she had to be there when we were finally reunited. It was wonderful to meet them, and we have a great relationship now. They’d always known I existed, but had to respect the family’s wishes. Now we Skype regularly and, as neither of them has their own children, they are delighted to get to know my sons. And all those years learning Greek, at Mum’s insistence, paid off, as I can speak to them.I forgave my parents quickly. At the end of the day, they’d always loved me. My wife and I struggled to conceive for two years, and that was tough. Mum and Dad had close to 18 years of that. My dad has since died, but he taught me so much, including how to be a father. My mum adores my boys. I’ll tell them one day: “Without that lady and the lengths she went to to become a mother, I wouldn’t be here and neither would you.”• As told to Sophie Haydock.

Her hair was dark brown and styled in a neat bob. An uncharitable person might have described her as dowdy. Her GP’s referral letter summarised the key facts of her case, which contained the essential elements of a tragic love story: emotional extremity, reckless abandon, passion and desire.After a few introductory remarks about my role as a psychotherapist, I explained that I wanted to hear her version of events.“It’s difficult,” she said. “I can tell you what happened, but it’s so difficult to express how it feels.”“Just take your time,” I replied.Megan had been married for 20 years. Her husband, Philip, was an accountant and they had always been happy. “We don’t have any children,” she volunteered. “It was just never the right time.”Two years before she came to me, Megan had consulted a dentist who specialised in complicated extractions. “I thought he was quite handsome. He had a pleasant manner. But…” She shook her head. “These things are so hard to describe. Perhaps I felt something – right at the beginning. I just wasn’t sure what was happening.”The dentist, Daman Verma (not his real name), performed the operation. Everything went to plan. But when the general anaesthetic wore off and Megan woke up, she felt different. “I opened my eyes and looked up at a light on the ceiling and I remember thinking: I’ve got to see him. I didn’t want to know how the operation had gone.”“Did you want to say something to him?”“No, I just wanted to see him.”“Yes, but why?” I pressed her for a more precise answer but she was either unwilling or unable to give me one.Verma was called by the nurses. He held Megan’s hand and said something – probably words of reassurance. She couldn’t remember, because she wasn’t really listening. She had become entirely absorbed by his face, which struck her as being unnaturally beautiful, and she discovered in his eyes something so extraordinary, it almost made her gasp: reciprocation. He wanted her as much as she wanted him. When he tried to move away, she gripped his hand a little tighter. He looked embarrassed. Of course: he couldn’t show his feelings, not in front of the nurses. He was a professional. She was mildly amused by his clumsy attempts to conceal the truth. She released his fingers, knowing, with absolute certainty, that the love they felt for each other was so strong they would spend the rest of their lives together.I have often found myself sitting in front of lovesick patients, whose psychological pain and behavioural disturbances are equal in severity to any of the symptoms of a major psychiatric illness. Such patients are usually embarrassed to disclose their thoughts lovesickness is supposedly transitory, adolescent, inconsequential or ridiculous.This couldn’t be further from the truth. The emotional and behavioural consequences of falling in love can be enduring and profound. I have treated an Oxford graduate who refused to move on when his girlfriend of four months ended their relationship, paying her unwelcome visits and following her car to try to convince her of their love. Then there was Mavis, a recently bereaved housewife in her early 70s who was struggling to cope without her husband – because she missed the sex their marriage, it transpired, had been based entirely on physical intimacy. Another patient, a successful businessman, loved his wife, yet risked his livelihood on 3,000 prostitutes – not because he was addicted to sex, but to courtship.Unrequited love is a frequent cause of suicide (particularly among the young). There is a view that intermittently gains currency within psychiatry and psychology that troubled close relationships are not merely associated with mental illness, but are a primary cause.Is it possible to fall so deeply in love, so quickly? We make judgments about attractiveness in a matter of milliseconds. We assume that beautiful people are more likable, friendly and interesting, something psychologists call the halo effect. But Megan had experienced something much more profound, and her insistence that her feelings were reciprocated was particularly unusual.“How did you know that he had fallen in love with you?” I asked her.“I just knew.”I paused to consider how I might best negotiate this impasse. “Why is it,” I asked, “that we believe some things and not others?”“Because we have reasons…”“So what were your reasons?”“I could see it in his eyes.”“What could you see?”“His need. You can see things in people’s eyes, can’t you?”Defensiveness had made her voice brittle.I asked if it was possible that she might have misinterpreted his expression.“What I saw was more meaningful. They say there’s a look – you know? – the look of love.”When people talk about the look of love, they are referring to something that scientists call the copulatory gaze: the eyes lock for several seconds before one party looks away. It occurs when prospective lovers first encounter each other – an intense stare that usually signals sexual interest. Apes do much the same thing.After her operation, Megan obsessed about Verma. Her sleep was disturbed and she couldn’t concentrate at work. She yearned to be near him.“Was the attraction sexual?”“No,” she protested. Then she sighed. “Well, yes, but it was only a small part. If it had been possible for us to be together, and the physical side hadn’t happened, that wouldn’t have mattered.”Her husband noticed that her mood was deteriorating. He tried talking to her, but she was distant and withdrawn. Weeks passed. Megan telephoned Verma. “It was an awkward conversation. I gave him a chance to tell me how he felt, but he was obviously scared. The experience had been too overwhelming.”“What did you talk about?”“My recovery – how it was going. Eventually, I had to say something more direct. I suggested that we meet up for a coffee, to discuss what we were going to do.”“And how did he respond?”“He pretended he didn’t understand. I persevered, but he was evasive. He made some excuse and hung up.”Megan phoned Verma repeatedly, sometimes several times a day. The dental secretaries asked her to stop. She tracked down his home number. When his wife, Angee, picked up the phone, Megan did her best to explain the situation as sympathetically as she could – because that’s what Daman would have wanted – but Angee became irritable.“She told me to get help.”“What did you think of that?”“So you could see how your behaviour might have looked to others?”“Mad, you mean?”“I didn’t say that.” But that’s exactly what I meant.“Yes,” she nodded.“Didn’t that make you pause to reconsider what you were doing?”“It wasn’t important to me what other people thought.”Megan wrote long, detailed letters to Verma every day suggesting solutions, begging him to recognise that their love could not be denied. Neither of them was to blame, how could they be? But it was wrong to deceive Philip and Angee, to perpetuate a lie. “I waited outside his practice, for hours. And when he came out, I ran over to him.”“He didn’t want to talk. I told him I understood, that maybe he needed more time. But in the end I said to him, you’re going to have to accept that this is real.”Verma contacted Megan’s GP, who contacted Megan’s husband.“He wasn’t very happy.”What made Megan so interesting was her ordinariness. She had previously suffered from mild depression, but there was nothing about her life or history that offered the slightest indication of what was to follow. She was proof that, as far as mental health is concerned, we all walk a tightrope it doesn’t take very much to make us lose balance and fall.Megan’s husband, Philip, was upset, but tried to be understanding. “He told me he loved me, and said he’d always be there for me,” she said. “It was sad.”“Because you didn’t love him any more?”Megan looked at me aghast. “No. I’ve always loved Phil. It’s just what I feel for Daman – it’s something higher.”“Maybe. It’s stronger, deeper, like something that was meant to be.”Megan had been taken by her husband to see a psychiatrist who put her on Pimozide, an antipsychotic drug that reduces delusional thinking. When the drug had no effect, the dose was increased but Megan’s longing seemed to increase. She waited outside Verma’s practice more often. Sometimes, he would send his secretary out with a message: go home. Megan didn’t argue.One afternoon, she followed him home and stood beneath a lamp-post opposite his front door. Verma stormed out of his house and confronted Megan, threatening to call the police. “He was pretending, for his wife’s sake. Really, in his heart, he wanted me to be there.” Whenever Megan was ordered to go home, she did, but by this time her behaviour was making everyone nervous. The Vermas had two young children and Angee was worried about their safety. Verma never called the police, recognising that Megan was ill, but his wife was less understanding.After 18 months, Verma opted for a radical solution: he applied for a job in Dubai. It was something the couple had discussed before but Megan’s harassment made the decision much easier.Verma and his family had been living in Dubai for six months by the time Megan was referred to me. She was no longer under the care of a psychiatrist, and her GP believed she was much improved. Nevertheless, he thought it would be helpful if she was given the opportunity to talk about her experiences with a psychotherapist: she had been traumatised and, like most trauma victims, she would make a better adjustment if she could make sense of her history. But the more I talked to Megan, the more I suspected that she wasn’t much improved at all. She’d simply become better at hiding her pain.“Yes. I miss him a lot.” Megan was studying her hands. “I often think about what he’s doing. You know, in Dubai… I think of him waking up and getting out of bed, brushing his teeth and going to work. I like to be on my own in the early evening, because I know that, in Dubai, he’s just gone to bed. It’s then I feel most that I can reach out to him.”A delusion is a rigidly held belief that is maintained even when there is no evidence to support it however, what constitutes good evidence differs from person to person. Megan regarded her own feelings as acceptable evidence: Verma was in love with her.The next time I saw her, she looked more tired than usual. “I wish I could talk to him on the phone,” she admitted.“Have you tried to get his number?”“I’ve thought about it, but no.”“Have you thought about following him to the Middle East?”“Yes,” she said. She sighed, her eyes glistening. “I know… I know.” That’s all she said. I can still recreate the sound in my mind: hesitant, slightly hoarse, full of sadness and resignation. Her grief was palpable. She had finally allowed herself to contemplate the possibility that Verma didn’t love her, that they would never be together.Falling in love is painful. Most of us know what it’s like – the desperation, the longing. And when we aren’t loved in return, the anguish can be unbearable. Megan believed she had found the love of her life. The distress that most of us might have to tolerate for months or years, she was going to have to tolerate for the rest of her life.“It’s so unfair,” Megan whispered.The tears tumbled down her cheeks. I was humbled by the sheer magnitude of her agony.What are the causes of De Clérambault’s syndrome? The most accurate and honest answer is also probably the least satisfactory. No one really knows. It has been attributed to neurotransmitter imbalances, but the medication employed to correct those imbalances is rarely effective. Dopamine might have a role to play, but Megan’s medication, which worked by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, had no effect. Most patients report a dulling of emotion, but the underlying fixation persists. Another possibility is abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes. De Clérambault’s syndrome and temporal lobe epilepsy share some common features: intensification of emotions, altered sexual interest and transcendent episodes.The syndrome is difficult to treat, and usually has a chronic course. A combination of medication and enforced separation is supposed to be the most effective treatment, but Megan had taken Pimozide and not seen Verma for six months, and still yearned to be with him.The reality of psychotherapy is that it is messy, and rarely progresses along satisfying lines. The pieces of Megan’s puzzle didn’t fit together neatly. A staunch biological psychiatrist would probably suggest that this is because De Clérambault’s syndrome is a psychotic illness and best explained by chemical imbalances in the brain. The fact that Megan’s medication didn’t work doesn’t compromise this argument. Perhaps we just need better drugs.I can’t offer a psychological explanation, but I can offer a kind of contextualisation. Megan was experiencing the same things that we all experience when we are smitten, only greatly magnified. Even her delusional thinking was, in a sense, normal, because romantic love is often very irrational – love at first sight and ascribing chance meetings to destiny are commonplace. Most love-struck iniduals engage in subtle forms of stalking – for example, loitering in places where they are likely to encounter the person they’ve fallen in love with. The only feature of Megan’s illness that marked a qualitative departure from normality was her absolute conviction that Verma was also smitten. Other than this delusion of reciprocity, Megan’s psychopathological love was simply romantic love writ large: not abnormal, as such, but supernormal.One day, I asked Megan if she thought we were making any progress. “Yes,” she said. “It’s helpful… talking.”I flattered myself that we were getting somewhere. But I was very much mistaken.I asked to see Megan’s husband, Philip. We talked a little about the nature of his relationship with Megan and how things had changed for the better since Verma moved to Dubai. “I don’t have to worry about where she is, or what she’s doing,” he told me. “She’s back at work now and she comes straight home. On the face of it, it’s like everything’s normal again. We chat, go to the cinema, go for walks.”“Are you still… intimate?”“Yes.” He suddenly looked bewildered, boyish. “Nothing’s changed – but everything’s different. It’s her, but not her. I know she’s thinking about him all the time. She’s probably even thinking about him when we’re in bed.”“You think she’s having sexual fantasies about him while you’re…”Philip cut in. “No, no.” He took a deep breath, “Well, I can’t say for sure, of course. Maybe she does think of him while we’re making love.” Philip believed that Megan’s feelings for Verma had become more elevated. “Has Megan told you about her… I don’t know what to call it, really. I suppose it’s like a shrine.”“What?” I sat up, surprised.He told me Megan had a box in her bedroom containing things that had some connection with Verma: a newspaper clipping of him at a fundraising event, his old business card, a pamphlet that she picked up at his clinic and her appointment letters.“What does she do with these things?”“She takes them out from time to time. She used to sit next to the box and close her eyes. It was as though she was praying.”Did I help Megan? In the end there was no cure, but she did come to accept that she would have to live her life without Verma and, to the best of my knowledge, never attempted to follow him to Dubai. She still loved him – and would love him for ever.Names and details have been changed• This is an edited extract from The Incurable Romantic – And Other Unsettling Revelations, by Frank Tallis, published on 7 June by Little Brown at £18.99.

Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f9ff631be853e9e6bbbbfbdc2ff0dc5884f258d/35_24_3533_2120/master/3533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84eef865a6036d145a614f890ba2a553","title":"netflix puts content above costs but is policy sustainable","story":"Streaming service needs even more subscribers to keep paying for expensive hitsNetflix briefly overtook Disney as the world’s biggest media company this week but some analysts are wondering if the streaming service’s rapid growth is sustainable. The company behind Stranger Things and The Crown must continue producing hits, poaching Hollywood talent and gaining subscribers at a rapid rate if it is to justify the faith of an investment community that pushed its valuation to nearly $162bn (£121bn) on Thursday – $10bn ahead of Disney.Netflix had reverted to second place by the close of trading but the trajectory is clear: the California-based business that started out as a DVD rental outfit in 1997 is putting Hollywood and conventional broadcast networks in the shade. It has 125 million subscribers worldwide – including more than 55 million in the US and more than 8 million in the UK – and this year the company is spending $8bn on content, including 700 original TV shows and 80 movies. This week, the company announced yet more of the high-end content deals that underpin its growth, signing up Barack and Michelle Obama to produce films and documentaries, and announcing a $150m blockbuster, Six Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds. The expenditure behind the casting coups and award-winning content, however, is significant. Netflix expects a negative free cash flow of between $3bn to $4bn this year – meaning the amount its spends on content, marketing and other costs in 2018 will exceed what it earns from subscribers by at least $3bn. It needs debt, and willing banks, to do this. Last month, Netflix raised almost $2bn in debt – its largest raise to date and the second time in less than a year it has turned to the debt market – to continue to feed film and TV content to the binge-watching generation it helped create.“They need to keep on borrowing as they are investing so much so quickly in content and have to stay ahead, there’s nothing else they can do,” Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders, says. “They have to stay ahead of Amazon and Apple, and soon Disney. They are at the moment but there are very well funded, larger, competitors starting to get their act together.”The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, does not like to come second and showed his intent to take the fight to Netflix with an edict to find a Game of Thrones-style hit for its Prime Video service resulting in executives striking a $1bn deal to bring the Lord of the Rings to TV. So, too, Apple, which outbid even Netflix’s seemingly bottomless pockets for a TV series starring Reese Witherspoon, who on top of her Hollywood star premium commands astronomical fees after the success of HBO’s Emmy-winning Big Little Lies, and Jennifer Aniston.Disney has pulled its vast array of content – from Star Wars and Toy Story to Beauty and the Beast and the Marvel universe of superhero films – from Netflix before launching its own streaming service next year.In the global quest to win subscribers Netflix has sparked a content arms race that is becoming an increasing financial burden on the company.Netflix declares a small profit – net income was $290m in the first three months of 2018 – because it is able to spread the spiralling costs of making programmes over a number of years. However, the company has almost $30bn of debt and liabilities across its balance sheet.Netflix’s total streaming obligations, for making and licensing TV and film content, will cost $17bn over the next few years, while its long-term debt as of 31 March was $6.5bn. It also has $3bn to $5bn in costs it expects to pay relating to “traditional film output deals or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown”. Including the recent debt raising, the company’s total liabilities are around $30bn.However, Netflix’s practice of spreading the cost of programmes over a multi-year timeframe – an industry standard – is being questioned by some analysts who argue that the binge-watch nature of an on-demand world means the value of a programme or film expires much quicker than on traditional linear TV.Meanwhile, the content deals keep coming. It has an agreement with Shonda Rhimes, creator of hits including Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder a $300m deal with Ryan Murphy, whose credits include Glee, NipTuck and American Crime Story the Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman, and Jenji Kohan, who is behind Weeds and Orange is the New Black. All of these cost a lot of money and are driving inflation in Netflix’s content costs.Netflix is adamant it can continue growing at a healthy rate. Its backers argue: 700m broadband and pay-TV homes around the world (excluding China) have yet to take up a subscription Disney and its ESPN sport unit happily shoulder sport programming commitments of $50bn and the S\u0026ampP credit rating service has put the company’s debt, which carries the riskier junk status, on a positive watch.The question is, can Netflix add enough new subscribers – and hopefully raise subscription costs – to keep up its increasingly costly spend on content, and service its debt.“Providing Netflix’s growth on subscribers and revenues remains at the same trajectory it is sustainable,” Broughton says. “Netflix has been adept at increasing pricing without losing subscribers but that is going to be difficult in its new growth markets like Asia and Africa, where there are cheaper competitors already. This year could be when Netflix starts to see slower growth. If the growth slows they are in trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec7b9b497ba93d8e4b2c03f2ee999272a4fe13ae/0_141_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ecf1e4e49a758ce63422c0b5181bc0","title":"asap rocky testing review","story":"The rapper’s aversion to the mainstream takes his third album to some glorious heights, with the help of Skepta and Frank Ocean. But is his swaggering decadence wearing thin?A$AP Rocky’s great gift isn’t that he flies above rap trends ­– it’s that he contorts them at will. Who else could be pitched as the successor to New York’s golden-age legends while leaning on subwoofer-rumbling, screwed-up Southern hip-hop? Rocky is an ostentatious impresario who took hollowed-out cloud rap and Odd Future’s lo-fi aesthetic and made it all sound like high-end fashion. A$AP – real name Rakim Mayers – will flow over the kind the dusty boom-bap associated with the legendary rapper he was named after, but also acidic Skrillex beats.He raps cleanly but not uniquely and his lyrics show him to be a man of simple tastes: threads, thuggin’ and admiring his own fine looks. Whatever “swag” meant to early-2010s rap kids, Rocky was dripping in it. The cover of his breakout mixtape, Live.Love.A$AP, featuring the star standing in front of an American flag, has become modern rap iconography – one nation under Rocky’s cool. But this is 2018: cloud rap beats are old hat, and the very meaning of that flag is being bitterly fought over. Can Rocky’s decadent vision of the world also evolve?What’s clear from Testing, his third studio album, is that Rocky won’t totally abandon the universe he has created for himself. Racked with tension and twistedly psychedelic, the record sees the 29-year-old take his unusual proclivities to even more outlandish destinations. Consider the opener, Distorted Records: it takes supreme magnetism to make the song’s analogue buzz sound musical but Rocky’s braggadocio (“If I’m in your top 10, mine better be the first name,” he sneers) brings the grating orchestration into line. Just as striking is the acid-laced, psych-rock freak-out Kids Turned Out Fine.Testing is completely out of step with any mainstream rap album you’re likely to hear this year. No trends past or present can explain A$AP Forever, on which Rocky raps over a heavy sample of Moby’s Porcelain, with its swooning strings, foggy vocal loops, hard-angle chord changes and health-spa drums. It sounds like a mixtape experiment rather than the marquee single for one of the year’s biggest rap joints (good luck finding a clutch of singles on here, by the way) yet by tying his uptown hip-hop with Moby’s heavenly trip-hop Rocky’s lovingly brought together two New York sounds. It’s a shame, then, that the album version adds TI and Kid Cudi, out-of-towners who dilute the concept.Produced by and featuring Skepta, Praise the Lord is built around a simple flute-like riff that any American grime fan who liked Stormzy’s Shut Up will be able to get behind Dev Hynes serves up the album highlight, Hun43rd, a doomed sermon that finds Rocky reminiscing about the days when he hustled on street corners and took fashion tips from Cam’ron. The biggest marquee guest, though, is Frank Ocean, who appears on the soul-buttered Brotha Man alongside Snoop Dogg and French Montana, and on the acoustic guitar-led soul of Purity. On the latter, Rocky slices into Ocean’s lane rather than vice versa, but this is a very good Frank Ocean song, and you can never get enough of those.Rocky similarly hopped between styles on his two previous albums, Long.Live.A$AP and At.Long.Last.A$AP, but Testing is a spottier affair. Too many tracks minimise his strengths: the AutoTune-garbled mumble he deploys on the FKA twigs-assisted Fukk Sleep, for example, is an uncomfortable fit. On the gun ode Buck Shots his flow, buried in a layer of vocal effects, barely makes an impression. And for someone who has made his name as a strutting one-liner machine, there’s a surprising shortage of memorable bars throughout.There are moments, though, when the dimension Rocky created for himself comes back to life. OG Beeper is a shot of pure swagger – the best song Lil Wayne never made. And he has rarely rapped as well as he does on Tony Tone. Under the watch of Puff Daddy, Rocky mirrors the cadences of the Notorious BIG, alchemising two generations of New York street rap. In these moments, the nation of A$AP is alive and well – but Testing still suggests that Rocky’s heyday is in the rearview."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3597ceea0f01f5f432d4cb5dcc14cd4b8999a4f/543_31_4121_2473/master/4121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf4b68dea4f78ee802c003844829b5c","title":"how britain let russia hide its dirty money","story":"For decades, politicians have welcomed the super-rich with open arms. Now they’re finally having second thoughts. But is it too late? In March, parliament’s foreign affairs committee asked me to come and tell them what to do about dirty Russian cash. As a journalist, I’ve spent much of my career writing about financial corruption in the former Soviet Union, but the invitation came as something of a surprise. After all, ever since I was at school in the 1990s, British politicians have welcomed Russian money to our shores. They have celebrated when oligarchs have bought our football clubs, cheered when they’ve listed their companies on our Stock Exchange. They have gladly accepted their political donations and patronised their charitable foundations.When journalists and academics pointed out that these murky fortunes could buy influence over our democracy and undermine the rule of law, they were largely dismissed as inconvenient Cassandras warning MPs to beware Russians bearing gifts. But earlier this year, after the poisoning in Salisbury of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, those little-heeded prophecies jumped straight into the pages of Hansard. “To those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple: you are not welcome here,” Theresa May told the House of Commons on 14 March, in a speech that blamed Russia for the attack. “There is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.”Britain’s entire political class joined the prime minister in this screeching handbrake turn. MPs who had long presented the nation’s openness to trade as a great virtue suddenly wanted to be seen as tough on kleptocrats, tough on the causes of kleptocrats. Having allowing so much Russian money into Britain, these MPs were now seized with concern that Vladimir Putin might, through his power over his nation’s super-rich, be able to influence our institutions. Were we selling Putin the rope with which he would hang us, they wondered.That is why, on 28 March, I took a seat in committee room six, a chamber high up in the Palace of Westminster, with heavy furniture, a view over the River Thames, and a carpet like a migraine. The foreign affairs committee exists to monitor the work of the Foreign Office – essentially, to keep an eye on Boris Johnson – but its members can investigate any subjects they choose. This time, they had chosen to look into the money Putin and his cronies hold in Britain and its overseas territories, with a view to exploring fresh opportunities for sanctions.I had brought along a list of things I wanted to talk about: how we should improve our defences against money laundering how we need transparency about who owns property how MPs themselves must stop taking money from dodgy ex-Soviet oligarchs if they want others to do the same.But the first question, from Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, threw me: “Can you give the committee a sense of the scale of so-called ‘dirty money’ being laundered through London?” she asked.It is a vast question, worthy of a book in itself, and one that even the National Crime Agency would struggle to answer, let alone me. Then came her second question: “What assets has that hidden money gone into?”I tried my best – I mentioned property, private schools, luxury goods – but I think she and I both knew I’d fluffed it. I should have brought along specific examples, with times and dates and names. The embarrassing truth is that, although I have written about Russia and its neighbours for two decades, during which I have increasingly specialised in analysing corruption, it had never really occurred to me to ascertain precisely how much stolen Russian money had found a home in the UK, or to chart exactly where it had ended up.If someone like me had been this culpably incurious, it is hardly surprising that politicians with dozens of other priorities have had to scramble to understand what we’re facing. But for the past couple of months, I have belatedly tried to discover an answer to the foreign affairs committee’s questions.It turns out that the situation is even more worrying than I had suspected.One way to begin investigating exactly how much Russian money there is in Britain – and how much of it is dirty – is to look at the official data. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service, at the end of September, Russian investors held financial assets in the UK worth a total of $3.5bn (£2.6bn). Our own Office of National Statistics provides a broader measure of all Russian investment in the UK, and assessed it – at the end of 2016 – at £25.5bn.That seems like a lot of money but, on a national scale, it’s small change. Investors from Finland alone have a stake in Britain worth twice that much, and we don’t lose sleep over the Finns destabilising our democracy. Sadly, the statistics are telling a misleading story. Russian money that moves through another jurisdiction before arriving in Britain isn’t counted as Russian and, since the overwhelming majority of money that enters and leaves Russia does so via tax havens such as Cyprus and the Bahamas, this means the official figures reflect only a small portion of the money the MPs were interested in.Over the past decade, £68bn has flowed from Russia into Britain’s offshore satellites such as the British Virgin Islands, Cayman, Gibraltar, Jersey and Guernsey. That’s seven times more money than has flowed directly from Russia into the UK. (On top of that, some £94bn has poured out of Russia into Cyprus, £13bn into Switzerland, and £23bn into the Netherlands, which has its own network of tax havens.)This wealth is not actually in the offshore centres – it is just registered there, which helps to obscure its origins. If you’re a Russian official whose wealth is wildly disproportionate to your salary, this anonymity allows you to spend your money in London without anyone realising you’re a crook. The French economist Thomas Piketty estimates that more than half of Russians’ total wealth is held offshore in this manner – some $800bn (£597bn) – and by a tiny number of people, perhaps just a few hundred. “Rich Russians live between London, Monaco and Moscow,” Piketty wrote in a blogpost in April. “Post-communism has become the worst ally of hyper-capitalism.”This means that there is not a single sewer pumping dirty Russian cash into the UK to which we can attach a meter, so as to measure its output. Instead, the cash is diluted into the great tidal flows of liquid capital that pour in and out of the City of London every day, from every corner of the globe. The ordure churned out by Russian crooks and kleptocrats is thus, thanks to the skilled attentions of the tax havens’ best brains, indistinguishable from ordinary investment.One of the few studies to forensically address this phenomenon came from analysts at Deutsche Bank, who, in 2015, looked at discrepancies in the records of money that flows into and out of the UK, and concluded that since the early 1990s, £133bn had arrived here without ever being publicly accounted for. They estimated that “less than half” of that sum was likely to be Russian, which means that Russians could have secret holdings here of up to £67.5bn, on top of the officially declared figure. (That is still a small amount compared with the holdings of German, American or French investors.)So whose money is this? How is it getting here? The bank’s analysts didn’t look into that question. However, had they wanted to, they could have walked down the hall and asked their colleagues, since it turned out that Deutsche Bank itself was a significant culprit in spiriting money out of Russia without informing the authorities. Less than two years after the report – called Dark Matter – was published, Deutsche Bank traders in Moscow were caught secretly moving $10bn (£7.5bn) of their clients’ money out of Russia by illegally exploiting the stock market. (As a result, the bank had to pay fines of $425m (£317m) in the US and £163m in the UK.)With institutions as sophisticated as Deutsche Bank working to hide Russian money, it is unsurprising that the total amount in the UK remains vague. So there is no real answer to the foreign affairs committee’s first question, except to say that the volume of Russian money in Britain is far larger than the official statistics would have us think.There are two reasons why we should be worried about this. The first is the low-probability but high-impact chance that Putin is hiding money here in the financial equivalent of sleeper cells, ready to slip out and buy influence when a crisis comes. The second is more significant: no one steals money if they can’t keep it. By letting Putin’s allies launder their stolen fortunes, and hide them in our country, we are drawing a line under their crimes, and rewarding them for actions we should not be condoning. Do we really want Britain to be the Kremlin’s fence?To attempt an answer to Priti Patel’s second question – what assets has all this money gone into? – we need to look at how wealthy Russians responded to the collapse of communism. They chose to spend their newly freed money on assets they had long been denied, and ones that could not be taken away from them. Above all, they bought luxury goods and property outside their own country, particularly in London.In early 1993, rich Russians were enough of a novelty for the Independent to report that three of them had bought flats in Kensington – at prices between £200,000 and £320,000 – under the headline “Property – a haven for rich refugees”. A month later, a Russian tycoon dropped £1.1m on a house in Hampstead, and then bought all the contents, too. “All he took into the house were four televisions and a vanload of carrier bags from Harrods,” an estate agent told the Evening Standard.Those purchases were the first ripples of a tsunami of wealth that crashed over the whole south-east of England, with spectacular consequences. In 2013, an analysis by the estate agency Knight Frank estimated that almost a tenth of all buyers at the top end of the London market came from the former Soviet Union, while rival estate agents Savills calculated that Russians like to buy the biggest houses of any group of purchasers. Average house prices in Kensington have risen eightfold over the past two decades, at least partly thanks to the influx from Russia.The poster boy for ostentatious expenditure has been the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who bought Chelsea football club in 2003. But even his London house – valued at £125m – was second ision in the spending league. In April 2011, a Ukrainian bought the world’s most expensive flat – the penthouse at One Hyde Park – for £136.4m. Five months later, a Russian bought Park Place, a stately home near Henley-on-Thames, for £140m. Russians who acquired homes valued merely in the tens of millions barely deserved notice.Among those lesser buyers was a banker called Grigory Guselnikov, a boyish 42-year-old who moved to London in 2008. He and his family came on tier 1 investor visas, which provide successful applicants with residency in exchange for an investment (of, at the time, £1m) in government bonds. In the eight years to September 2015, Russian citizens made up 764 of the 3,396 people who paid for these so-called golden visas – making them the second largest group of applicants, after Chinese citizens. This arrangement brought in around £800m of Russian investment, but the flow dropped markedly after April 2015, when the UK authorities began to check the origin of the money used to buy these government bonds. Once rigorous checks were put in place and the price of the visa was doubled, the number of applications fell sharply. In the final quarter of last year, just 16 Russians applied for a golden visa.Guselnikov believes that politicians’ sudden panic about Russian money in Britain is misplaced. When we met in his office in a grand terraced house on Grosvenor Square, he began by pointing out that Russian money had less influence over British business than people think. “I can’t recall any big enterprise controlled by Russians, or any big company. They open restaurants, wine shops, they buy luxury stuff like football clubs.“Where the impact is significant is real estate,” Guselnikov continued. “And primarily real estate in London.” His most high-profile investment was the shop that houses the Rolex concession on the ground floor of One Hyde Park, which he bought in 2011 for £12m (and sold for £20m three years later), and which demonstrates the peculiar dynamics at the top end of the property market, where the price of residential property is inflated beyond any conceivable income it could generate. “There is a shop, with advertising, 300 sq metres and the price is £12m. The flat above has no advertising, no shop, no ability to make money it’s the same size, 300 sq metres, and cost £25m. The shop was two times cheaper than the flat, that was really funny,” he said, with a laugh.His second point was that it was a misconception to think Russians are Machiavellian masterminds buying up slabs of Britain in order to undermine us from within. “You have to understand why people buy real estate abroad – they see it as their pension, they want to ersify the risk. In Russia, you have to be ready to lose everything, you never know what will happen,” he said. “They just spend money here. They don’t invest, they spend.”One reason the Russian super-rich come to Britain, Guselnikov said, was for education. His own children attended private schools, although they now have British passports, so they were not counted among the 2,806 Russian children attending schools surveyed by the Independent Schools Council last year. By multiplying that total with the average fees parents pay, we can calculate that a minimum of £48.3m comes to Britain’s private schools each year from Russia.Guselnikov said banks had become more stringent in their checks on the provenance of money in the last few years, so it was unlikely that significant flows of dirty money were entering the UK from Russia any more. But he conceded things had been different in the past. “If any dirty money is invested in UK property, it was before 2008 or before 2011 at the latest, not now. I don’t think the UK’s attractive any more, I don’t think it’s possible any more,” he said.It may well be that, as Guselnikov said, many honest Russian businesspeople have indeed been behind these purchases of London property. However, thanks to tax havens and skilled enablers from the world’s major financial institutions, their money has been mingled with the proceeds of theft, bribery and corruption. Imagining that Britain will be unscathed by this influx is the macro equivalent of letting a kidnapper, a bent copper, and a heroin trafficker move into your village, and still expecting warm chats at the school gates.Transparency International published a report last year, which, relying only on public sources of information, identified 160 properties in the UK, together worth £4.4bn, that had been bought by what it called “high-corruption-risk iniduals”. Most of those properties were in London, and half of them were within three miles of Buckingham Palace – and that is just a fraction of the true total. “There is currently no credible deterrent in place for money-laundering failings from estate agents,” the report noted.Two years ago, a former fund manager called Bill Browder gave evidence to parliament’s home affairs committee in which he revealed how $30m (£22m) that had been stolen from the Russian state by a group of corrupt police officers and officials had come to the UK, via 12 different banks, and been spent on an array of luxury goods: $176,000 went on chartering a private jet $192,000 on redecorating a yacht $20,000 on private school fees $41,000 on a wedding dress $295,000 to pay off an exclusive women-only credit card that offers “the most privileged and luxurious service”.Browder, who was born in the US but is a British citizen, ran a successful Moscow-based fund until 2007, when the corrupt officials fraudulently claimed ownership of two of his investment companies. They realised that, by fiddling the books, they could claw back the $230m in taxes that he had paid on the year’s profits, which is what they did. The $30m that ended up in the UK derived from this act of grand larceny. When Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky exposed the fraud, he was arrested and detained in jail, where he was beaten and denied treatment for pancreatitis until he died. Browder has devoted the years since Magnitsky’s death to seeking justice for his lawyer, and punishment for those responsible. He employs a team of forensic accountants, who have traced the movement of the money that was stolen from the Russian budget.The spending that he described to parliament fitted the pattern laid out by Guselnikov: it was being blown on luxury goods, rather than being invested to win influence over British politics or society. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned about it. This money should have been paid as taxes and spent on hospitals, schools and other services in Russia. Instead, it had been stolen from taxpayers and splashed on an absurd array of goodies. This is the kind of money Britain has been happily fencing for decades. Even now, British MPs only seem to care about it because its owners might harm our national security, rather than because it should be returned to the people it was originally stolen from.Browder told the home affairs committee that he had traced chunks of the stolen money to 11 other countries – including France, Switzerland and the US – and investigators in every one of those countries had opened criminal cases based on the information he provided. But in Britain – where he had spoken to the politan police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), the Serious Fraud Office, and HMRC – he had been turned away every time.Why was Britain the only country that declined to act on the information Browder provided? His conclusion was that too many influential people – lawyers, bankers, accountants, property developers – were dependent on dirty Russian money for their livelihoods. “If that money was stopped,” he said in 2016, “certain people would find themselves without businesses, and I think those people have political weight in this country.”Many British institutions have indeed accepted donations from wealthy Russian businesspeople: Sadiq Khan’s City Hall from Elena Baturina, whose husband was mayor of Moscow the Conservative party from Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband was one of Putin’s ministers, and who paid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron in 2014.But it is not venal politicians who are stopping British police conducting investigations into the laundering of Russian money in the UK. According to Tristram Hicks, who was the detective superintendent in charge of economic crime at the Met until 2009, and who now acts as a freelance consultant to police forces around the world, the problem is far more serious than that.In order to prosecute a foreign crook in Britain, you need to prove their money originated in a crime of some kind, and that requires evidence from overseas. Essentially, if you want to prosecute a Kremlin insider, you need evidence from the Kremlin, which naturally it will not provide, and that stops investigations from progressing. And this is not just a British problem. After France, Switzerland and the Netherlands received information from Browder that some of the stolen $230m had been spent in their countries, they froze the assets in question – but their criminal investigations are yet to secure convictions. Only US prosecutors have managed a result, and even that was just an out-of-court settlement, without an admission of guilt by the defendant. “You cannot underestimate the technical hurdle that is bringing the evidence to a British standard for a British court,” Hicks said.That isn’t the only obstacle to investigating money laundering. Given that all wealthy Russians have political connections – otherwise, they wouldn’t be wealthy – if the UK does gain cooperation from Russian investigators in a prosecution, the defendant will invariably claim, often with good reason, that he is being politically persecuted, which allows his lawyers to discount the evidence being used against him.Take Andrey Borodin, the owner of that £140m house in Henley-on-Thames. He arrived in Britain in 2011, pursued by Russian charges of having defrauded his own bank. Borodin insisted the charges were politically motivated, and gained asylum here. Had prosecutors brought charges in the UK, his lawyers could have discounted any evidence from Russia as the revenge of political rivals, and Hicks conceded this would essentially doom the prosecution’s case. “That’s hard to argue against,” he said.There is also a third difficulty that Hicks didn’t address, which is just as serious. If a wealthy, ruthless Russian faces investigation, he can stop any chance of prosecution by killing the witnesses. This may well have been what happened to Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, and who was working with Spanish and British authorities to expose Russian money flows. It may also explain the death of Alexander Perepilichny, a 44-year-old banker who was helping Browder’s team to understand the destination of the $230m stolen from the Russian budget, and who died while jogging in Surrey in 2012. Investigators at first thought he had suffered a heart attack, but it appears that he may have been poisoned with a rare plant extract.In short, to bring a successful money-laundering prosecution against a wealthy Russian, officers need to win cooperation from Moscow, which is all but impossible to convince a UK court that any cooperation that does result was not politically motivated, which is extremely difficult and then to keep their witnesses alive, which has proven rather hard. In the circumstances, it’s not surprising that the NCA decided bringing a prosecution in the Magnitsky case was not the best use of its resources.The amazing thing is that we have tolerated this situation for so long. Britain has consistently welcomed Russian money, and consistently ignored the warnings of those concerned about what it is buying. In March 2000, when Putin was still just acting president and had spent six months pulverising Chechnya, Tony Blair dashed to St Petersburg to be the first western leader to secure a meeting with the new man, and to urge more investment in each other’s countries.At least Blair could claim not to have known what kind of man Putin was, but David Cameron had no such excuse. In September 2011, Cameron went to Moscow to seek business for the City of London, although most of the facts that are currently concerning MPs about Russia were already known. Litvinenko had been murdered five years previously, and Russia had given one of the Met’s suspects in the case a seat in parliament. Magnitsky had died in jail two years earlier, and his tormentors were walking free. But Cameron went to Moscow anyway.“The whole point about trade is that we are baking a bigger cake and everyone can benefit from it and this is particularly true, perhaps, of Russia and Britain. Russia is resource-rich and services-light whereas Britain is the opposite,” Cameron told students at Moscow State University, on a trip that also involved meetings with Putin and his then placeholder president Dmitry Medvedev.In his speech, Cameron boasted that Russian companies accounted for a quarter of share offerings on the London Stock Exchange. “Governments need to remember that businesses don’t have to invest in our country – they choose to. And we need to help them make that choice,” Cameron said. “It means minimising the burden of regulation so that business and entrepreneurship can flourish.”With a prime minister who considered regulations on the origin of money to be a burden, it’s unsurprising that not many of them were made. This approach did not of course begin with Cameron, or even with Blair. In fact, it goes back to the mid-20th century. After the second world war, Britain was all but bankrupt, the City of London was somnolent, and economic power rested on Wall Street. City bankers wanted to get back into business, but were frustrated by the weakness of the pound, and its unsuitability as a means to finance the world’s trade.Their salvation came from an unlikely quarter: the Soviet Union, which didn’t want to keep its dollar reserves in US banks. Instead, it kept them in London, where British banks began lending them to each other in an entirely unregulated market – they became known as “Eurodollars” – thus giving birth to offshore finance, and providing the City with the startup capital it needed to get back in business. By the end of the communist period, Soviet institutions routinely sent their money through Britain’s offshore territories, and the City was booming. The Central Bank in Moscow even had a shell company in Jersey, which it used to hide money from the government that it was supposedly a part of.This is one of the problems with trying to ascertain the volume of dirty Russian money in London: how far back do we go? Do the fees Midland Bank received for banking Soviet money in the 1950s still count as Russian cash, and if so, are they dirty? Does the commission the estate agent earned by selling those flats in Kensington in the early 1990s count as dirty money? And what about the £800m that Russians paid for government bonds in return for golden visas? Or the $41,000 of Magnitsky money that was spent on a wedding dress in London? How many times does money have to circulate in the economy before we decide it’s not dirty any more?This money is so deeply embedded in the UK that extracting it, or even identifying it, would be an unrivalled feat of investigation. “It would be impossible,” says Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Sheffield University. “They have the big accountancy firms advising them where best to stash the money, to conceal it, to disguise it, all kind of things. The brains of this pinstriped mafia are available to everyone. They’re for hire.”Recently, I spoke to Jon Benton, who led teams fighting dirty money at the Met and the NCA, and advised Cameron at the Cabinet Office, until his retirement in 2016. “We used to get these suspicious activity reports coming in, Russian ones, all the time. It would be for an investment or a property or a load of other things,” Benton said. “You’re looking at something that doesn’t look right, doesn’t smell right, but we had a tiny number of resources. To get caught up in some really complex Russian money-laundering case, when we weren’t going to get any assistance – you have to weigh it up. Do I try to throw lots of resources at this, when I know I’m really going to struggle to get the door open?”Benton was optimistic about the introduction of so-called unexplained wealth orders, which came into effect in February this year. Once a UWO has been issued, property is frozen, and its owner has to respond and justify why they own it. But that will only confiscate property, Benton noted. It won’t put anyone in jail.“The time when we might have been able to do something about this was 20 years ago, when it wasn’t particularly sophisticated, and the large sums of money were just arriving in the country,” he said. By ignoring the provenance of dirty cash, and allowing it to be spent on property, British authorities have cleansed it of its taint: it is legitimate investment now. “Unpicking all that is a real challenge. The reality is that it’s probably the hardest area to penetrate in the world.”We don’t know how much dirty money there is in the UK, nor do we know exactly where it is, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Or rather, there’s nothing we can do about it with the laws as they stand, and without giving greater resources to law enforcement agencies. Almost 100,000 UK properties are currently owned via offshore companies, obscuring their ownership, many of them undoubtedly by Russian criminals and kleptocrats we could happily do without. The government has promised to force these offshore companies to disclose their true owners, but that won’t be until 2021. For the next three years, criminals will be free to profit from their property in the UK without admitting they own it. Why can’t we hurry that up? To answer both of Priti Patel’s questions – how much money is there, and where is it? – we need transparency.The foreign affairs committee published its conclusions this week, drawing on the evidence that I and others gave it, and they were impressively robust. Its report demanded a more coherent government approach to the “assets stored and laundered in London (which) both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy”.Earlier this week, it was reported that Abramovich is finding it hard to renew his British visa, and some newspapers are speculating that this suggests Britain is already pioneering a new approach to Russian money, one that demands checks on the fortunes even of the very richest, and even when there is no apparent evidence of corruption. We do not yet know the reasons for the delay in the Chelsea owner’s visa, but such checks should be welcomed anyway: in cases where evidence emerges that someone is corrupt, that person should be kept out of Britain. But this alone is insufficient we need to find the dodgy money that is already here. Confiscating it and finding a way to return it to the Russian people would diminish those who mean us harm, while simultaneously helping those we wish to befriend.That requires strengthening Britain’s investigative power. The National Crime Agency and the UK’s police forces currently lack the resources to bring the prosecutions that could really make a difference to criminals’ calculation about whether to bring their money here. If we wish to prevent Russian kleptocrats from buying our country, we need to start catching them and their enablers in the act, and prosecuting them. That is the only true deterrent.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08499cf0bb5d1a94fa3224f42443f8cc34bf89c/0_0_5426_3394/master/5426.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130a15b8c7067debae1656b7ca0b09c4","title":"majority of eu27 favour simple approach on britons residency","story":"Only around 10 EU states likely to use system similar to that planned by UK for EU nationalsA majority of the EU27 do not plan to force UK nationals living within their borders to register for a special residency status after Brexit, in contrast to the UK government’s treatment of EU nationals.An initial meeting of officials and diplomats in Brussels on the treatment of UK nationals post-Brexit found a mood in favour of a “smooth and simple” approach.Governments across Europe have different approaches to dealing with foreign EU nationals who move to live in their country, with some encouraging or demanding registration.Many in the meeting on Friday expressed the view that imposing a mandatory system on British nationals in their country would prove an unnecessary complication and expense.Britons who move to EU countries before the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020 will be granted rights similar to those available today, although with some gaps, including the right to onward movement between member states.The UK has opted to set up new system for resident EU nationals, under which applicants will be charged £72 each. The former home secretary Amber Rudd vowed it would be as simple as setting up a shopping account with the high-end retailer LK Bennett.It subsequently emerged that the app for the system would not work on iPhones, a brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK.Ingrid Taylor, 61, a translator who has lived in Germany for 30 years and who is a member of the lobby group British in Europe, said her fellow Britons abroad were keen to avoid unnecessary paperwork.“We need some kind of document to show that we have rights but it should be a declaratory system, not a long application that people have to fill out,” she said. “That will bring all sorts of problems and pitfalls, as we have seen with the 85-page permanent residence application form in the UK.”Of the 27 member states represented in the meeting in Brussels on Friday, around 10 were minded to establish a system similar to the UK’s, and around 17 were opposed, according to EU sources.Of those with the most UK nationals, Spain said it was undecided and representatives for France did not share their thoughts. Germany said it was undecided but was leaning towards an obligatory system for Britons, in order for the government to be able to recognise people conferred with rights under the withdrawal agreement and those not.The European commission proposed a uniform set of identification documents to be made available for UK nationals who make their home in the EU before the end of the transition period. A follow-up meeting on the issue is expected in September.

Which fruit and veg improves with age and which loses most nutrients?Best-before dates have expired, at least for fruit and vegetables. This week Tesco revealed it is to stop using the date stamps on almost 70 of its own-brand products in an attempt to tackle food waste. But is older produce as good for you as fresher stuff?Luke LaBorde, professor of food science at Penn State University who led the research into spinach, said the rate at which levels of such substances fall varies for different plants and nutrients, with environmental factors like temperature and oxygen levels also important. A key factor, he says, is the rate of respiration of produce after harvest, which is linked to the onset of a process of deterioration called senescence. But the situation is complex. “Vitamin A and iron are stable, but vitamin C is lost over time,” said Dr Christine Bruhn from the University of California, Davis. “The important thing is to eat fruits and veggies. The best advice is to buy and eat soon. Remember, frozen, canned and dried forms all contribute to health.”Dr Kirsten Brandt of the human nutrition research centre at Newcastle University agrees there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for how quickly substances like vitamins break down in produce. “For every fruit and vegetable it is more or less different because it depends on the life cycle of that plant. If you take onions, they can be stored for many months without losing any nutrients,” she said, pointing out that in nature they sit dormant in the ground for long periods.Storing produce in the fridge to slow the breakdown of vitamins can have downsides, though. For example, chilling potatoes increases their glucose content. Then, when the potatoes are fried or roasted, this sugar reacts with other substances to form a chemical called acrylamide which has been linked to cancer.There is also good news for some nutrients like iron and calcium. “Minerals aren’t going to degrade they will always be there,” said LaBorde."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3b2392755090097649fec50b9b7b09c0ae6598/157_439_4963_2977/master/4963.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b6e6d61526860696a86b0b37ab62a6","title":"chris froome solo pink jersey giro ditalia stage for the ages cycling","story":"On one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d’Italia history, Chris Froome produced a performance that ripped the breath away, obliterated his rivals and, sensationally, put him in the maglia rosa with just two stages remaining.His successful 80km solo breakaway brought to mind the legendary Belgium Eddy Merckx in his prime.It was undoubtedly a remarkable feat of riding. The problem Froome will face, given cycling’s charred history, is that the remarkable tends to become accompanied by suspicion. And Froome, remember, is riding under a cloud as he tries to clear his name having failed a drugs test for salbutamol in September.Froome denies any wrongdoing and that will hardly bother him tonight. As he crossed the finish in 5hr 12min 26sec he raised one arm in triumph, having taken the pink jersey. Only Tom Dumoulin, who is now 40 seconds back can surely stop him now.Long down the road, Simon Yates, who had started the stage leading Dumoulin by 22 seconds and Froome by 3min22sec was wobbling home. For two weeks he had worn the pink jersey with distinction. Now he had to suffer the ignominy of finishing 38 minutes back.Before Friday’s 19th stage from Veneria Reale to Bardonecchia, everyone knew that Froome would attack on the Finestra, the Cima Coppi of this year’s Giro, with its 45 hairpin bends along a summit 2,178m high. No one, though, expected the attack to be so frenzied, or so sustained. Then again, Froome had nothing to lose given his goal holding all three grand tours - the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and the Giro – at the same time was still just about tenable.Yates was the first to crack early up the Finestra. Soon, sadly, the 25-year-old from Bury was wobbling with all the uncertainty of a club rider on his first hors catégorie climb.Before the start director sportif Matt Scott had punchily dismissed any suggestions that his man was ill or spent. And when asked whether Froome was a threat to the pink jersey he shook his head. “If it happens it will be on the Finestre,” he conceded, “but we’re ready for it.”But they weren’t. Then again, nor was anyone else. Because it quickly transpired that Froome, though, was merely getting started. A sustained attack with 80km remaining instantly left the rest of the field gasping. And by the summit of the Finestra, his lungs surely red raw from effort, he had already opened a gap of 42 seconds to a group of four riders headed by Dumoulin, along with Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López and Richard Carapaz.There Froome passed a man in an inhaler suit – a reference to his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol at last year’s Vuelta as first revealed by the  – but his mind was purely on the descent. At times his riding looked reckless – at one stage motorcycle bearing a cameraman had to brake suddenly to avoid knocking him off his bike – but it was hugely effective.By the time Froome began his climb up the Sestiere, an ascent famous for Lance Armstrong breaking away from the bunch in 1999 to announce himself as the new king of his sport, Froome’s lead was 1min 52s.Try as he might, Dumoulin was unable to respond and, with 40km to go, Froome became the virtual race leader. Yet while his rivals were far behind him on the road, there were still obstacles ahead of him and at one point he had to swerve past a crashed race motorbike while powering down a dark tunnel.Froome was still looking so strong but up the final climb to the finish at Bardonecchia he had to dig deep to come home. It was an extraordinary effort. But more mountains await on Saturday – and this race may not be over yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db691a0fe263d8fac5de5149a16697942a8752f/0_1_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b651e3fd684da34cc2fc1dbd0c8a45d","title":"leinster pro14 final scarlets","story":"Leinster want victory on home territory to add to their European Champions Cup and Ireland’s Six Nations grand slamTwo weeks after winning the European Champions Cup, Leinster have the opportunity to complete a green sweep. Victory over the Scarlets in the Pro14 final at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Saturday would deliver a triple crown after Ireland’s Six Nations grand slam.Leinster defeated the Scarlets even more comprehensively than the 38-16 scoreline suggested when the two sides met in the Champions Cup semi-final last month, dominating possession and territory after denying the Welsh region turnover possession to exploit.The Scarlets, though, are the reigning Pro14 champions and defeated Leinster at the RDS Arena in last year’s semi-final before overwhelming Munster in the final at the Aviva. They won their semi-final last week in Glasgow comfortably, moreover, even if a number of players had a few nights of discomfort after suffering friction burns on the artificial pitch, and have kept reminding themselves of the manner of the Champions Cup semi-final defeat.“We were bitterly disappointed with the way that day went,” says the wing Tom Prydie, who a few hours after the match will fly from Dublin to the US to join up with the Wales squad after his first call-up for five years. “We did not fire many shots: they were physical and beat us up. Ever since, we have focused on putting right what we did wrong then.”Leinster won the battle of the breakdown, supporting the ball-carrier to ensure players such as Tadhg Beirne, the former Leinster player who is appearing for the Scarlets for the last time before moving to Munster next season, John Barclay, who is out of action for at least six months with an achilles tendon injury suffered at Glasgow in what was his final game for the region, and James Davies were unable to pilfer possession.“We have to be more physical at the breakdown,” Prydie adds. “We were unable to get over the ball and we have looked at stopping them making gains with every carry. You cannot only jackal effectively if you knock them back in the tackle and we also have to be smart when we have possession. There were times against Glasgow when we did not respect the ball enough and gave them opportunities.”It is not only the Scarlets who are thirsting for revenge. Leinster may have hurled them out of the Champions Cup, but they have not forgotten the play-off defeat last year when they were kept at arm’s length despite enjoying a man advantage after Steff Evans was sent off for a dangerous tackle at the end of the first half.“What happened last month will be fuel in the fire for them, but we owe them one in this competition,” says Jack McGrath, the Leinster and Ireland prop. “It will be the fourth time we have played them this season and we know each other very well. We cannot stick to the blueprint we used in the Champions Cup because they will be prepared for that. Changing not too much but just enough is they key for us. It is a special time in Leinster and we want to give the guys who are going away something to take with them.”Leinster have yet to achieve a European Cup and league double, although they did win the Challenge Cup and then the Pro12 in 2013. After conquering Europe in 2011 and the following year, they lost play-off finals to Munster and Ospreys respectively.“We know what we are up against and what it will take to win, but we are the champions and we want the trophy again,” Prydie said. “The stadium will be mostly made up of Irish supporters, but there will be a sizeable contingent shouting for us. Our supporters have been magnificent all season and we want to show our gratitude to them. We are playing away, but we are comfortable with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c29898e5c28011bc29d343d9fab1d7a757e55a/0_160_4480_2689/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59529fd9c51ac5925fc5657c8e32823","title":"monaco gp f1 peril drivers test","story":"Formula One has long been happy to paint the Monaco Grand Prix with the very broadest of brush stokes. Here then, the streets of the Principality glory in the sport’s glamour, its ostentatious wealth over a weekend that embraces the spotlight and the celebrities it attracts beneath the clamour of a thousand flashbulbs. It is yachts and it is parties on yachts, where people come to be seen and F1 in turn sells itself to the world in the sunshine by the sea.A bold and not a little brash picture is but the facade of a meeting that remains the most demanding test in Formula One. What really matters here is what happens behind the wheel and Monaco is still the drivers’ race.Hosting its 76th grand prix this weekend, Monaco will once again offer its singular examination of risk and reward, which the greats have always embraced. Yet the race is a curious meeting. The glamour attracts casual viewers across the world who may not tune in to another all season but then often presents a rather prosaic procession. For many fans it can be a chore to be endured.If the show is sometimes wanting, the drivers do not care. At Monaco the test is all. Martin Brundle equalled his best finish with second place here for McLaren in 1994. He was beaten by Michael Schumacher and had passed Gerhard Berger round the outside of Mirabeau to claim the place. He remembers the race and indeed every time he faced down Monte Carlo’s walls with affection.“I have always loved Monaco,” he says. “It’s the challenge and is today still seen as the drivers’ race rather than anything else.”Unsurprisingly when inch-perfect driving is required repeatedly over 78 laps, Brundle is explicit on why the race matters so much when you are in the cockpit. “It’s because drivers can really make a difference,” he says. “There is nowhere to make a mistake. You arrive in Casino Square at 180mph. Imagine 180mph, it seems inconceivable. You are making millions of conscious and subconscious decisions and taking actions. You live on your wits but there is always more time, you can brake later, turn in faster but the peril is always there.”Brundle’s second place was bittersweet. It was the first race held after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola. The Brazilian was the master of Monaco, with six wins and had famously found an entire other plane during qualifying in 1988. “I was no longer driving the car consciously,” Senna said. “I was kind of driving it by instinct, only I was in a different dimension.” Indeed he was, ultimately 1.4 seconds ahead of his team-mate, Alain Prost.Brundle understands the feeling. “Senna described it as an out of body experience and I can relate to that,” he says. “You do get in a bit of a trance because it is absolutely relentless for two hours. Any slight error and it is going to be a big crash. You can’t miss-kick the ball, or slice a backhand. The peril added to the reward of really attacking the track is great.”Lewis Hamilton, who has always been clear in how much he delights in Monaco’s challenge, echoed Brundle’s views this week. “It’s very intense,” he said. “It’s the most technical and mentally challenging circuit of the whole season. There’s also the heightened aspect of just wanting to shine at a track like this.”Brundle will return to the grid this weekend in Monaco but now in the role he has made his own, with his pre-race grid walk, a tradition he began 21 years ago. It has proved to be part of a remarkably successful and respected career in broadcasting. But he still describes himself as “a racing driver who does TV”, and that is what really informs his passion for Monaco.“It is so special after the race,” he says. “The feeling that somehow you have survived a week in Monaco, glancing from barrier to barrier, from bump to kerb.”Which will be the task in hand in qualifying on Saturday , where Red Bull look in fine form to threaten the Mercedes and Ferrari hegemony and is, far beyond the sound and fury of Monaco’s extravagance, the real reason this race is special."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ae1dc412c1ade11d1645053da682c936331b40/8_0_3866_2320/master/3866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26496ac2f13e3feb44d9489ecb497ba7","title":"england v pakistan first test day two live","story":"97th over: Pakistan 308-5 (Shadab 30, Faheem 37) Wood starts his over with a cracker of a delivery, which has Shadab squirming but doesn’t catch the edge. A single later Wood does get an edge, but the ball flies between a static Bairstow, who thought Cook at first slip should go for it, and Cook, who only goes when he realises Bairstow won’t. That was painful, and it becomes more so when the very next delivery if thumped through midwicket for four. Cook rewarded Bairstow with an evil glare. “It was Shadab and Faheem who ruined Ireland’s hopes in the Malahide Test match a fortnight ago with a partnership of 120,” notes Martin Gilbert. “Looks like they could be able to do the same to England here.”95th over: Pakistan 298-5 (Shadab 29, Faheem 29) Shadab tries to work the ball down the leg side, but it goes straight past the bat and is caught by Bairstow, who appeals half-heartedly and is ignored. He totally mishits the next ball, which is in the air for a while but lands safe between mid-on and midwicket. One of the things England have lacked so far is luck. Faheem then pulls the final delivery for four, effortlessly, straight out of the middle of the bat.94th over: Pakistan 291-5 (Shadab 26, Faheem 25) So that’s drinks, and an opportunity for England to discuss how to curtail one of the more comfortable periods of Pakistan’s innings. Will they get past option one (namely, complain to the umpires about the ball and hope they give you a more fun one)?93rd over: Pakistan 287-5 (Shadab 23, Faheem 24) Wood returns, and Shadab gets a couple off the final delivery, which takes a leading edge but rolls away safely. “Is it ironic that in a match that England selected Buttler for lower order acceleration and a young spinner Bess, we are being shown how to do it by lower order dasher (Faheem) and possibly a young Shadab wrapping up the second innings?” wonders Sachin Paul. Sounds to me like proof that England got their selection just right. 92nd over: Pakistan 285-5 (Shadab 21, Faheem 24) Faheem tries to pull Broad’s final delivery, gets only glove on it but it’ll do, the ball trundling to the fine leg boundary. Pakistan’s lead is thus extended to triple figures, currently standing at 101.91st over: Pakistan 280-5 (Shadab 20, Faheem 20) An update on Babar, who apparently has not required an x-ray, and is quietly “managing his pain”.90th over: Pakistan 276-5 (Shadab 19, Faheem 17) Pakistan are enjoying the new ball (well, except for Babar Azam, obviously). Shadab drives past gully for four, and sees out the remainder of Broad’s over comfortably. 89th over: Pakistan 272-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 17) So having given Stokes a bit of a go with the new ball, Root finally hands it to Anderson. And he elicits a lovely cover drive from Faheem, who is careering along well in excess of a run a ball.88th over: Pakistan 268-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 13) The ball flicks off Shadab’s pad and rumbles away for four. There follows an absolute cracker of a delivery from Broad, heading into Shadab and straightening to beat the bat, which by the end is nowhere near it. His only reward is a sheepish grin from the batsman.87th over: Pakistan 264-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 13) Faheem gets two boundaries, both sent to an unguarded third man. This is interesting, though I suppose Broad has yet to complete an English summer, and by the end of it he might be knackered enough to bring those averages back down again.86th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 3) Broad bowls full and Shadab punches it through cover for four, Root chasing gamely and launching a last-moment full-length superman e in a vain attempt to cut it off. Four balls later he might have gone. His review was instant, though - presumably he’d felt some gentle contact.The TV umpire spotted the very tiniest edge, therefore denying us the chance to see HawkEye show it was probably clearing the stumps anyway.The umpire thought so, the batsman thinks not. Let technology decide!85th over: Pakistan 250-5 (Shadab 11, Faheem 3) Babar was not wearing an arm guard - Faheem Ashraf resisted the urge to hurriedly strap some on before he replaced him - and arms are simply not made to withstand that kind of impact. If there’s no fracture there it is a miracle of evolution.Babar is going off, heading to the nearest x-ray machine, and Faheem Ashraf comes out.84.2 overs: Pakistan 246-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 10) Stokes bowls short, and Babar has no idea what to do about it. Instead of swaying backwards away from it he kind of half-crouches, putting his hands and his head precisely in the path of the ball, which then crashes into his left wrist. He goes down, clearly in pain, and is now receiving treatment (namely, an ice pack). Hence this mid-over update.84th over: Pakistan 245-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 9) That’s a fine over from Broad, without reward. Still, at least they didn’t score off it. Meanwhile, it’s Friday afternoon, it’s the cricket - there’s no way there’s tea in that mug. Champers at the very least, surely.83rd over: Pakistan 245-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 9) Stokes continues, Shadab pushes through the covers for four, and then flicks the next delivery off his hip to deep square leg for a second helping.82nd over: Pakistan 237-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 1) A nearly over from Broad, which comes close to a reward when Babar erts the ball just past the stumps, with Broad doing a pre-emptive gleeful skip of potential joy, and even closer when the next delivery is edged wide of Stokes at third slip - it didn’t carry to the cordon anyway - and away for four.81st over: Pakistan 232-5 (Babar 64, Shadab 0) England snaffle the new ball at the earliest opportunity, and give it to Ben Stokes. After free dot balls Babar tries to push one to mid on, outside edges, and gets away with it. Off it shoots, away for four.80th over: Pakistan 228-5 (Babar 60, Shadab 0) After tea one over still remains to be bowled with the old ball and Bess speeds through it, at the expense of one run.The players are on their way back out. It remains exceedingly grey in north London, but very much dry. The same is not true everywhere in the country, sadly.And that is a significant morale boost for England as they head for tea.79th over: Pakistan 227-4 (Babar 59, Ahmed 9) The new ball is due in two overs, it’s just before tea and England totally reorganise their field for Stokes’s last stab with the old nut. A helmet is brought on, Root pops it on and stands at short leg, and sends a few extra fielders to the boundary. Clearly, Stokes is going to bang it in and hope for the best. And this he does, several times. Sarfraz ducks under the first attempt, leaves the second and, with just one ball to go before tea, goes after the third! Mistake.England lay a trap for Sarfraz, and he falls for it, slashing at a short ball and top-edging it to Wood at deep fine leg!78th over: Pakistan 227-4 (Babar 59, Ahmed 9) A first boundary for Ahmed and it’s a decent shot, half-volleying the ball to deep midwicket. A moment later, just as Bess enters his delivery stride, Ahmed takes a big stride backwards, so he’s standing well outside leg stump. The bowler aborts.77th over: Pakistan 222-4 (Babar 59, Ahmed 4) Stokes bowls a harmless short, wide delivery at Babar, and the batsman tucks in. Four runs.76th over: Pakistan 215-4 (Babar 54, Ahmed 2) Bess keeps going. He’s the most expensive of England’s bowlers, going for precisely 3.5 runs an over so far, but having tried to go for him this morning the batsmen have been more circumspect this afternoon. Still, no maidens in his 14 overs.75th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Babar 52, Ahmed 2) Having stood at the other end while Stokes gave Babar a bit of a workout in his last over, Sarfraz is understandably cautious when it’s his turn to have a go. What results is the first maiden for 22 overs.74th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Babar 52, Ahmed 2) That’s 50 for Babar, his half-century brought up with a nice cut for four. That’s his sixth Test 50, and he’s yet to get a century.73rd over: Pakistan 209-4 (Babar 48, Ahmed 2) This is good stuff, Stokes getting one to move into the batsman, the next to move away, and the one after that to move in again. Babar swishes at the second and is lucky to get nothing on it, and gets a single off the last, but that was a fine half-over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df8bb9a288e87444bf6a72afc27313bb4656642/0_344_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798cce5f396838f2d6b52463561eb69b","title":"giro ditalia 2018 stage 19 live","story":"On one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d’Italia history, Chris Froome produced a performance that ripped the breath away and put him in the maglia rosa with just two stages remaining“I don’t think I’ve ever attacked with 80km to go like that before on my own, and got all the way to the finish,” he said. “But the team did such a fantastic job to set that up for me.

There are some sums to be done before we know how much Froome’s lead will be tomorrow. He won bonus seconds for finishing today’s stage in first place. Challenging Miguel Ángel López for the white jersey, Richard Carapaz nicks the six bonus seconds by coming second and is followed over the line by Pinot and then Lopez. Having done all the work on the chase, Tom Dumoulin gets no bonus seconds whatsoever. Chris Froome will begin tomorrow’s penultimate stage in the pink after one of the great cycling performances. That was an epic stage. Having been on his own for 80 kilometres, Chris Froome wins the stage and puts himself in pole position to win the Giro d’Italia. He started this morning in fourth place, 3min 22sec off the lead. He finishes with the race lead. We’ll let you know how much he leads by just as soon as it’s confirmed. That was an astonishing ride - arguably the finest of his career. He wraps up the stage win in a time of 5hr 12min 26sec and punches the air in triumph as he crosses the line. 1km to go: As is customary on such occasions, there are a number of drunken gobshites lining the road, but Froome has passed under the one-kilometre to go kite and is now on a section of road protected by race barriers. 1km to go: Stage 19 enters its knockings and Froome is out of the saddle on the fairly narrow, spectator-lined road leading to the finish. The gap is 3min 18sec. 2km to go: Froome maintains the 3min 14sec to Dumoulin that will put the Sky rider in the maglia rosa on the penultimate day of this year’s Giro. Tomorrow’s stage is tough and it will be interesting to see how much, if anything, today’s 80-kilometre solo effort has taken out of him. 3.2km to go: In the white jersey, Lopez attacks off the front of the three-man Dumoulin group and Carapaz takes off in hot pursuit, leaving Tom Dumoulin isolated. Froome leads Dumoulin by 3min 08sec. 4km to go: Froome pedals onwards and upwards to the stage finish at Bardonecchia. Behind him, Thibaut Pinot has opened a gap of four or five seconds on the three-man group led by Tom Dumoulin. Dumoulin is with Miguel Ángel López and Richard Carapaz, who are fighting it out for the best young rider’s white jersey. 5km to go: Thibaut Pinot leaves Tom Dumoulin behind, but the man in second place on GC is able to regroup and rejoin the two riders duking it out for the white jersey. Froome leads the stage by 3min 11sec from Thibaut Pinot, who has opened a small seven or eight-second gap to Dumoulin. 6km to go: Froome’s relentless solo effort continues and tom Dumoulin cracks. He’s now paddling at the back of his own small group and in obvious distress.8km to go: Chris Froome is about the hit the steep section of the stiff final climb. Behind him, Tom Dumoulin is doing all the hard work at the front of the four-man posse, but isn’t closing the gap. Remember that Froome has been on his own for 80 kilometres - that’s some effort. 9km to go: The race leaders have taken pity on Simon Yates and stopped giving updates on his time a fair while ago. He was nearly 20 minutes off the pace and struggling very badly the last time we got an update.10km to go: Froome continues to increase his lead with a fine solo effort. He passes under the 10km-to-go kite with a lead of 3min 34sec over the four-man group led by Tom Dumoulin and Thibaut Pinot. As things stand: Chris Froome is the virtual leader of this year’s Giro d’Italia and has a 33-second lead over Tom Dumoulin. Thibaut Pinot, who has been working hard in Pinot’s small group of riders has moved onto the podium and is 4min 30sec behind Froome. 14km to go: Dimension Data’s Ben O’Connor has abandoned after crashing into some barriers on the most recent descent. It looked a sore one, but he got back on his bike only for his injuries to get the better of him a short time later. It’s a shame for him as he’d been riding an excellent Giro. 16km to go: The gap between Froome and the Dumoulin group is 3min 08sec and there’s one big climb left today - to the finish line at the Cat 1 Bardonecchia. 20km to go: Froome increases the gap to 3min 08sec after a splendid ride, while the volume of chippy correspondence from Sky fanboys and girls increases in my inbox. It’s like a cult. A big cult of Blinkered Whataboutery.Personally, I have no particularly strong opinions one way or the other on whether or not Froome should be in this year’s Giro or not, but the evasiveness of his team, a team founded on transparency, certainly does him no favours when it comes to ladling out sympathy or giving riders the benefit of the doubt. Whatever your thoughts on his unresolved Salbutamol case, it’s been an epic stage in a fascinating Giro and both Chris Froome and Tom Dumoulin deserve immense credit for two brilliant rides that have set us up for an epic denouement. An email from Jorrit Kors in the Netherlands: “Regarding the email from Christopher Lawton - there are no questions,” writes Jorrit. “Froome should never have been allowed to compete. It is a joke. Go Tom!” 32km to go: Froome extends the gap to 2min 58sec and becomes the virtual race leader. He can’t win this year’s Giro today, but he’s put himself in the box-seat with just one day of serious racing to go. An email from R Williams: “What does the Froome-hating  have to say now?” he asks. “He’s a class act and his performance today is breathtaking.” Breath-taking enough to require a toot on an inhaler? Froome forced to take evasive action: Anyone who has ever attended one of Sir David Brailsford’s press conferences or seen him appear in front of a government select committee will know that Team Sky are masters of evasion and for once it proves very beneficial, as Chris Froome is forced to swerve around a crashed race motorcycle while cycling through a dark tunnel. Luckily, the driver of the motorbike appears to be OK. That’s the second close, motorcycle-related shave Froome has had today - on the descent of the Finestre, a motorcycle bearing a cameraman had to brake suddenly to avoid knocking him off his bike. An email from Christopher Lawton: “Exciting as this is surely there are going to be a lot of questions now around whether Froome should be competing,” he says. “While we are not yet in Armstrong territory the image of cycling does not necessarily benefit from Froome’s ride.”45km to go: Froome crests the Sestriere, taking the King of the Mountains maglia azzurra jersey from Simon Yates in the process. Simon Yates has lost over 20 minutes and his hopes of winning this year’s Giro today. With Yates no longer in the picture, Dumoulin is the virtual race leader but Froome only needs to put another nine seconds to him and he’ll take that honour as well.46km to go: This is a remarkable effort by Chris Froome, who is approaching the summit of the Sestriere and continues to put time into Tom Dumoulin, extending the gap to 2min 38sec. Those in the Dumoulin group appear to be suffering and are summoning their cars to furnish them with food and drink. 50km to go: Chris Froome continues his ascent of the Sestriere with a lead of 2min 08sec over the chasing group being led by Tom Dumoulin. Froome is on his own, Dumoulin has the support of Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz. Carapaz and Lopez are duking it out for the white jersey of best young rider and have not been contributing to the chase. In virtual terms, Dumoulin is the leader of this year’s Giro with a 44-second lead over Chris Froome.55km to go: Chris Froome takes some food and drink on board as he prepares to hit the slopes again, en route to the third big climb of the day, the Cat 3 Sestriere. Froome leads the Dumoulin group by 1min 53sec. The Dumoulin group leads the Pozzovivo by 1min 10sec. Froome, Dumoulin or Pozzovivo will win this year’s Giro d’Italia. 57km to go: After a descent that often bordered on the downright reckless, Chris Froome has a stage lead of 1min 50sec over Tom Dumoulin - he put a minute into his nearest pursuers on the downhill of the Finestre. Simon Yates, bless him on a horrible day, has just gone over the summit of the Finestre and is more than 17 minutes off the pace being set by Froome.An email from Marco Grandi: “I am sorry to see Yates suffer, but its a great payback towards the arrogant crew in the comment sections who so many times forget that this is a three-week race,” he writes. Arrogance? In the  comments section? Surely not. 69km to go: For the first time in three climbs up the Finestre in the Giro, the race leader has failed to hang on to the maglia rosa. And how - Simon Yates is now 13min 16sec behind today’s stage leader Chris Froome, who is currently negotiating the descent. Yates could conceivably lose half an hour or more today.Behind Froome, virtual race leader Tom Dumoulin is in hot pursuit, in the company of Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz. Froome’s lead on the stage is 1min 18sec. 71 km to go: Tom Dumoulin is organising the downhill chase behind Froome and it’s interesting that he’s in the company of Thibaut Pinot, who is a notoriously poor descender. As they crested the summit of the Finestre, Dumoulin gestured to Pinot as if to say: “Follow me and I’ll guide you down”. 73km to go: Tom Dumoulin is being forced to do all the hard graft at the front of the five-man group that is 38 seconds behind Froome. Chris Froome crests the summit, the highest point of this year’s race and begis a very technical descent. The road is narrow, it’s wet in places and there’s quite a scary drop to the right. 74km to go: While there seems little point in continuing to monitor Simon Yates’s grisly demise, there is something grimly fascinating about watching a Grand Tour leader’s challenge disintegrate in such spectacular fashion. He’s now 10min 30sec off the pace being set by stage leader Chris Froome. Froome leads Tom Dumoulin towards the summit of the Finestre - the gap between the pair is 37 seconds and there are 73 kilometres to go. 76km to go: Chris Froome leads the stage by 40-seconds from Tom Dumoulin, his main rival for this year’s Giro. Dumoulin is in a four-man group with Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López and Richard Carapaz. In the big news of the day, Simon Yates is nine minutes behind Chris Froome on the road today and the gulf is getting just bigger and bigger. It’s been a nightmare day for the man in the pink jersey. don’t forget, there’s a long, long way to go in today’s stage.77km to go: Simon Yates seems to riding through treacle and the gap between him and stage leader Chris Froome is heading towards the eight-minute mark. On a remarkable day’s racing, Chris Froome has a 34-second lead over the chasing group of four riders including Tom Dumoulin. Froome needs to gain 2min 54sec on Dumoulin if he’s to be in pink tomorrow. They continue the ascent to the summit of the finestre and they’re high above the snow line. 79km to go: How things stand: still on the monster climb of the day, Chris Froome is alone in front. Behind him, Tom Dumoulin, Thibaut Pinot, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz can still Froome in the distance - his lead is 17 seconds. Domenico Pozzovivo, third on the GC at the start of racing today, has also been dropped. In the pink jersey, Simon Yates is now five minutes down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f16ae20518d9e14120c25c541f25ce11eb68aff/0_42_3184_1911/master/3184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=309990f50ec81223e5550e6064430087","title":"linda sarsour israeli intel firm spied palestinian american","story":"An Israeli private intelligence firm spied on the Palestinian-American activist and Women’s March co-chair Linda Sarsour and her family in an apparent attempt to collect damaging information, according to a report by Haaretz.Israel Cyber Shield (ICS), supplied information to a rightwing pro-Israel group associated with American billionaire and Donald Trump backer Sheldon Adelson, the Israeli newspaper reported.Haaretz claimed ICS delivered the dossier to the Act.IL group, and the material was used to dissuade US colleges from allowing the activist, who supports a boycott of Israel, to speak on campus.Sarsour, who lives in Brooklyn, has been a frequent target of pro-Israel pressure organisations. She is a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led global effort to persuade companies, artists, governments and universities to boycott Israel over its occupation of the Palestinian territories, as well as other demands.Modelled on South African anti-apartheid campaigns, BDS is seen as a strategic threat by Israel’s government, and it has banned members of organisations it deems pro-BDS, including a Jewish anti-occupation non-profit, from entering the country. The blacklist has been condemned as an assault on free speech.Haaretz cited a student who it said volunteered for Act.IL and claimed the Sarsour dossier included a password-protected file containing information on her parents, as well as a court case in which she was involved.The dossier included allegations that Sarsour applauded violence toward Israeli soldiers and a tweet of hers that said, “Nothing is creepier than Zionism”. It concluded with “an executive summary that highlighted her apparent weak points”, the report said.Act.IL, which says its primary goal is to battle BDS and the “delegitimization of Israel”, used the information to prepare a letter that was distributed to the heads of universities where Sarsour had appeared, Haaretz said.One of the US’s most prominent activists, Sarsour is co-chair of the Women’s March movement and spoke at its main Washington rally after Trump’s inauguration. Haaretz said Act.IL’s CEO, Yarden Ben Yosef, confirmed that his group received materials from ICS but did not pay for it.The head of ICS and a former officer in Israel police’s international crime ision, Eran Vasker, was quoted in the article as refusing to disclose if he had worked for Act.IL. “ICS operates lawfully, engaging in research and information on anti-Israeli activity, the delegitimisation movement and its activists – as reflected in their visible activity on social media. We do not engage in building files on activists or their families.

The Russian government must now answer for its actions in relation to the downing of MH17,” said Johnson in a statement. A Downing Street spokesman said that during a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, Theresa May said the alleged actions “fit into a well-established pattern of Russian aggression”.Despite longstanding suspicion and a mounting body of evidence pointing to Russia’s involvement, this is the first time governments have officially accused Moscow over the incident.“Australia and the Netherlands have now informed the Russian Federation that we hold it responsible under international law for its role in the bringing down of MH17,” said Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, on Friday.She called on Russia to “enter into negotiations to open up a dialogue about its conduct and to seek reparations”.The call is likely to bring about a diplomatic standoff, with Russia continuing to deny complicity and refusing to cooperate with investigators.The plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine in July 2014. More than half of the victims were Dutch, and there were also 44 Malaysians and 28 Australians onboard.Bishop said her country would seek financial compensation from Russia for the families of Australian victims. “They want to see closure but they also deserve justice and we will be seeking reparations for the atrocities caused by this conduct,” she said.Johnson said the MH17 incident was “an egregious example of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent life” and he offered his support for the Dutch and Australian demands.“The UK fully supports Australia and the Netherlands in their request to the Russian Federation to accept state responsibility and to cooperate with them in their efforts to deliver justice for the victims of this tragedy,” he said.The EU and Nato also issued statements calling on Russia to accept responsibility.Russia has vetoed a UN tribunal to determine guilt for the incident, so the JIT intends to issue indictments for a trial to be held in a Dutch court. On Thursday, the Dutch chief prosecutor, Fred Westerbeke, said the investigation was in its “last phase” but he declined to say when a court case might start. He said the JIT was investigating “several dozen” suspects for complicity in the incident, though he did not say how high up the chain of command they went.Russia has issued a series of blanket denials over its involvement, and officials and state-linked media have floated a series of implausible alternative theories suggesting Ukrainian armed forces were to blame. On Friday, the Russian defence ministry issued a fresh statement suggesting all Buk missiles with the serial numbers indicated by the JIT had been destroyed in Russia in 2011, suggesting the missile must have come from the Ukrainian armed forces. The foreign ministry complained that “these gratuitous accusations are an attempt to discredit our nation in the eyes of the international community”.However, the evidence against Russia continues to mount. On Friday, the online investigations group Bellingcat held a press conference to reveal that it had identified a Russian military commander operating in eastern Ukraine at the time of the crash. Bellingcat said the military commander, known by his call sign Orion, about whom the JIT had called for information, was in fact Oleg Ivannikov, an officer in Russia’s GRU military intelligence service. Bellingcat said Ivannikov, operating under an alias, was responsible for the transfer of Russian weaponry into eastern Ukraine during 2014. The group, which uses mainly open source research, identified the 53rd brigade as the potential source of the Buk system nearly two years ago.

I am fasting and I am praying all day for the right result,” said pastor Stephen Finley, an American who moved to the parish of Kiltoom in 2006 with his wife. Roscommon was the only county to vote against same-sex marriage in the 2015 referendum, but the notoriety is unwelcome among voters who say the accolade as Ireland’s most conservative county is a reflection of wider conditions. “If you mapped the age profile of this cohort here to Dublin you’d get the same result and he wouldn’t like that.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.17:23\t\t\t        \u0026#10Vote No Ireland \u0026 you\u0027ll save the lives of countless thousands.

Photograph: Jiji PressAFPGetty ImagesFor over a week, the biggest story in Japan has not been diplomatic flip-flopping over the Korean Peninsula but an ugly tackle at a college football match.Footage of 20-year-old Taisuke Miyagawa bulldozing into a quarterback from behind during an American football game earlier this month has gone viral.The story has topped news bulletins night after night. Miyagawa’s shamefaced mea culpa at the Japan National Press Club this week was broadcast live on some channels.A few days later it was the turn of Miyagawa’s coach to face the limelight. Masato Uchida admitted the player was told to “crush” his opponents but said he was not directly ordered to commit a foul.Uchida has since quit as head coach of the Nihon University American football team but his denials infuriated many in Japan. The victim, who played for archrival team Kwansei Gakuin, has reportedly filed a criminal complaint with the police. The government’s sports agency has launched an investigation.It’s hardly a slow news month. Apart from the drama over the fate of Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, which directly threatens Japan, government business has been paralysed by claims of cronyism and influence peddling by prime minister Shinzo Abe.American football, which was brought to Japan by a missionary in the 1930s, is a niche sport at best, far less popular than sumo, baseball or soccer. Pundits have had to explain that tackling with intent to injure is breaking the rules.Why has a foul in a sport few watch triggered such soul-searching? One reason, perhaps, is that the media is bored after months of covering political scandals. Another, said Kiyomi Tsujimoto, a politician with the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, is that it seems to reflect events in the political world.For over a year, Abe has denied involvement in a sweetheart deal to the operator of an ultra-nationalist kindergarten where children chant patriotic slogans in front of pictures of the emperor and pledge to give themselves “courageously” to defend Japanese territory.He also says he played no direct part in nudging bureaucrats to help open a veterinary school for an old college friend. The approval is worth millions of dollars in free land and grants, and comes at a time when demand for vets in Japan is declining, along with the number of pets.Opinion polls suggest these denials are widely disbelieved. Yet, like the football scandal, pinning down who exactly is to blame has been frustrating. The fragmented opposition has failed to land a knockout punch. “When the government stops taking response for its actions, it has a negative ripple effect on society,” said Tsujimoto.The tackle may also resonate, however, at a deeper level than politics. Miyagawa’s unwillingness to say no to a powerful older male reflects an “age-old total submission” to bosses, teachers and other figures of authority, says Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, a former government adviser.“This is a dark side of our society – your boss is your emperor,” says Nishimura. Rigid hierarchies are common in government and the workplace, which is why the story has riveted the Japanese public, he says. Loyalty to a boss often triumphs, even to the point where “you dump your integrity”.One player on the football team told broadcaster NHK that the regime under coach Uchida was akin to an “absolute monarchy.” During his press conference, Miyagawa described being bullied to toughen up or risk losing his place. After the invocation to “crush” the rival quarterback, he ran onto the field and took him out of the game.Two more fouls later Miyagawa was sent off the field and retired to a nearby tent, where he wept in apparent remorse. Afterwards he said that although he knew what he was being asked to do was wrong, he felt unable to say no."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508377.1527257698!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"get your voice heard on brexit talks corbyn urges ni politicians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, poses for a selfie with Prof Deirdre Heenan during a visit to Lifford Bridge on the Border. Photograph: Liam McBurneyReutersNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table, British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said.The head of the British opposition visited a bridge at the Border on Friday as part of his two-day tour of the country.The porous 300-mile frontier is one of the most vexed issues facing negotiators in Brussels, but Northern Ireland has no ministers to intervene since devolved government at Stormont collapsed more than a year ago.Mr Corbyn addressed a meeting of business leaders in Derry: “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in Northern Ireland. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that.“There is to be a transition period but the transition period is not unlimited, that we well know, and crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning.”A “backstop” Border option if no other deal was reached with the EU would see Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK follow Brussels regulations relating to co-operation on the island of Ireland to protect frictionless all-island trade.The British government has said it is focused on securing a customs deal which would avoid the need for such a backstop and has ruled out anything which would create a regulatory difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Mr Corbyn walked the Lifford bridge between Northern Ireland and the Republic, close to the Co Tyrone town of Strabane, and took selfies with passersby.He supports a customs arrangement with the EU to protect trade and ensure no regulatory barriers after Brexit.The British government is examining whether a customs partnership or a technological solution to border checks can be made to work.The opposition leader added: “Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy.”Mr Corbyn said a hard frontier would seriously damage Northern Ireland’s northwest, including the life chances of those already suffering from excessive unemployment.He claimed the British government was making a mess of the negotiations and was too ided and weak to get a good Brexit deal.Stormont has not sat for more than a year following a dispute over a botched green energy scheme.Northern Ireland’s rudderless public services were thrown into sharp relief recently when a Civil Service decision to approve a major incinerator project in the continued absence of powersharing ministers was overturned by a court.Mr Corbyn added: “It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever.” – Press AssociationNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Mother and child die as baby poisoned through breast milk after snake biteTwo former French spies accused of spying \u0026#39for China\u0026#39Donald Trump: June 12 meeting with Kim Jong-un could still happenVictoria Beckham \u0026#39mortified\u0026#39 after mistaking Thandie Newton for Zoe SaldanaThe companies and organisations that have already spectacularly fallen foul of the new GDPR lawsMorgan Freeman\u0026#39s voice pulled from adverts in CanadaGDPR bureaucracy chaos as churches stop prayer requests and charities prepare to halt meals on wheelsDuchess of Sussex chooses songbird and sunshine to represent Californian roots in new coat of arms -

However, they held off from rate hike to 0.5 per cent in May on the basis of the surprise GDP figures and want to see more data confirming their view that the slump is temporary.Mr Carney, conceded on Thursday that there might be deeper problems in the economy. “The weakness in demand at the start of the year could reflect a worsening of the underlying economic climate, not the temporary effects of adverse weather as the Committee currently assesses ... there is a risk that households could opt to save rather than spend as their real incomes recover,” he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The trend is really worrying.”The government’s focus on improving the take-up of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects could have played a part as figures show sciences and maths did not suffer the same fate at A-level. The number of entries in computing – one of the government’s flagship subjects – jumped by 26 per cent from 7,710 in 2017 to 9,685 this year. And uptake of the maths A-level rose by 3 per cent.Unions say the government’s exam reforms – such as the introduction of the tougher English GCSE– may also have deterred some students from studying English in sixth-form.Jill Stokoe, a policy advisor at the National Education Union, told The Independent: “I think part of it is the drive towards Stem.“With English, history and geography, it could be that the difficulty of the new GCSE specification has put people off at A-level.”And reforms – which mean AS levels no longer count towards final grades – are likely to have led to fewer students taking these subjects in Year 12 and then deciding to take them onto A-level.Figures show that entries for AS levels have fallen by almost 60 per cent this year – from 659,880 to 269,090 – continuing a trend triggered by the decoupling of AS levels from A-levels.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesRory Mcilroy has taken the clubhouse lead in round two of the BMW PGA championship at Wentworth.Alastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

And in performingexpressive arts, entries among GCSE students plummeted by 40 per cent. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school headteachers’ union (NAHT), said: “Students’ experiences of a narrower curriculum at GCSE is now having an impact on their sixth form studies.”Disadvantaged students with lower grades do as well in medical schoolHe added: “It is now impossible to argue that the EBacc measure is not having a narrowing effect on young people’s choices at GCSE. “These reforms put schools in an impossible situation where they must reduce the opportunities they offer to pupils in order to satisfy an arbitrary government target.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The Government has worked with employers to reform GCSEs and make them gold-standard qualifications. They will prepare pupils for future success and help deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future. Entries to the core academic EBacc subjects have increased, with over 4 million of these exams being taken this year, including significant increases to those taking the inidual sciences.They added: These subjects give pupils the best foundation to progress into further education and employment. Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, academic standards are rising with 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Due to be released this summer, the\u0026nbspaction plan will be an official response to the survey’s findings.The news comes as the UK falls to fourth in Europe in the Rainbow Index, a yearly ranking of the progress made in LGBT+ rights, having topped the list in 2012.Though given the Conservative Party’s history of dragging their heels on LGBT+ rights, as well as May’s personal history of voting against progressive legal reform, not everyone is convinced. The Labour Party responded by labelling the plan as “empty PR”.Paul Twocock, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall UK, welcomes the Government’s intention to publish an LGBT+ action plan. Stonewall research reveals that 20 per cent of LGBT+ people have experienced a hate crime within the last 12 months. For trans people, this figure increases to a staggering 40 per cent. Paul believes that the action plan, combined with the government’s recently reaffirmed commitment to launching a consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, will improve life for LGBT+ people in the UK.Both the action plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT+ people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone and it will mean this government can maintain the UK’s impressive record as a world leader on LGBT+ equality.Susie Green, CEO of trans and gender identity charity Mermaids, cites hate crime as a major concern of trans youth. Susie believes that May’s action plan must urgently address this hostility, which is fuelled by sensationalist media coverage.We need stronger controls around media coverage of transgender people, and particular attention needs to be given to the use of online media to perpetuate hate crime. Young people and trans women in particular are targeted on social media, with little done to protect them.Susie would like to see statutory training for all areas of service around transgender children and young people, including schools, social care, police and healthcare. Lesson plans in school covering transgender identities should be mandatory, and included from primary school age.Teachers need to be equipped to deal with conversations around transgender children and young people, which is clearly not the case at present.Concerns over outdated sex and relationships education are also expressed by Liam Beattie, relationships and sex education policy lead at Terrence Higgins Trust. While Wales announced a progressive overhaul of their SRE curriculum, England still lags behind in its approach towards gender and sexuality in the classroom.\u0026nbspBeattie explains that a lack of inclusive sex education at school made him feel “invisible”.LGBT+ sex and relationships must be included when relationships and sex education becomes compulsory in all English schools from next year. Looking back, I’m still angry that I left school completely oblivious to the realities of HIV or the fact that, as a bisexual man, I was at higher risk than my sisters or straight friends.My gaps in knowledge had to be filled through speaking to gay and bi friends or using dating apps. We can’t continue to let young people down like this. The feelings of isolation and shame that follow so many LGBT+ people from childhood to adulthood can have a corrosive impact on their mental health. As a result, LGBT+ people are twice as likely to have a mental health condition compared to heterosexual people. Upon the announcement of May’s action plan, Paul Martin OBE, chief executive at LGBT Foundation, said:LGBT+ people continue to face a significant number of inequalities from poorer physical and mental health, increased risk of hate crime and discrimination, to loneliness and isolation and negative experiences in employment and we hope that a commitment to tackling these key issues will be outlined in the upcoming action plan.To alleviate these inequalities, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell believes that the LGBT+ action plan must urgently confront homophobia in schools. He says:Nearly half of all LGBT+ pupils have been bullied, often leading to anxiety, depression, truancy, academic under-performance and self-harm.To combat anti-LGBT+ bullying and other forms of hate crime such as racism, the Prime Minister should make equality and ersity lessons mandatory in every school, from the first year of primary education onwards. The health and welfare of pupils must take priority.There should be no opt outs for faith schools and no right of parents to withdraw their kids.\u0026nbspAs Home Secretary, May faced criticism for her handling of asylum claims relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, LGBT+ asylum seekers are still detained indefinitely, despite never having committed a crime. Leila Zadeh, executive director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, told indy100:An action plan to improve the lives of LGBT+ people should include clear and tangible commitments to improving the wellbeing and safety of LGBT+ people who are seeking asylum.As long as LGBT+ asylum seekers can be detained or made to share accommodation, there will be risks to their personal safety. The government should also review the quality of its decisions on asylum applications by LGBT+ people, to ensure none are returned to persecutionNigerian LGBT+ rights activist Bisi Alimi would like to see a national monument commemorating the struggle for LGBT+ rights in the UK. He believes that this will help to imprint the memories of the LGBT+ movement in public consciousness.This monument should put into account the iniduals across race, gender, religion and age that have shaped Britain pre and post Section 28 and should form\u0026nbsppart of the school curriculumThough while there are many voices welcoming the plan, there are also sceptics. Editor-in-chief of Attitude Magazine Cliff Joannou believes that, because of the government’s failure to introduce statutory LGBT+ inclusive relationship and sex education in schools, the legacy of Section 28 looms over schools and local authorities. He tells indy100:For Theresa May to announce her \u0027LGBT Action Plan\u0027\u0026nbspin a gay magazine on the anniversary of Section 28 is both ironic and crass.The government has shied away from tackling LGBT+ discrimination in faith schools, where homophobia and transphobia is most prevalent. Shockingly, conversion therapy is still legal in the UK.While these issues continue to affect young LGBT+ people we will be far away from the equal society that the government likes to fantasise over.Actions speak louder than words, and successive governments have failed to take any action on the very real issues that the LGBT+ community continues to face.More:\u0026nbspWales \u0027leads the way\u0027 with new LGBT-friendly sex education curriculum for next articleindy100 and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

The European Commission’s negotiators have already rejected the plan before its public announcement, as first revealed by The Independent earlier this week.“The regulatory alignment option is not available on the all-UK basis because it would amount to selective participation on the single market,” the senior EU official said, adding that the backstop “cannot be time limited”.It is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision“A backstop that would be strictly time limited would defeat the purpose of a backstop,” they said, before making clear that the Prime Minister’s plan for a UK-wide backstop would have to be withdrawn if progress is to be made at the June European summit.As well as the main issues of customs and the Irish border, side issues like the European arrest warrant and the Galileo satellite system have made little progress since March too. EU negotiators complain that the British side “do not understand” that Britain will not be able to use the European arrest warrant after Brexit, with Theresa May again having pledged to stay in the system just three months ago.“There are member states that simply cannot extradite their own nationals to a non-member of the EU. This is a constraint that unfortunately will apply once the UK is outside,” the senior official said.“The European arrest warrant is simply not available. I don’t think you can expect member states to change their constitutions in order to continue extraditing their nationals to the UK.“These are not bureaucratic issues. We are talking here about the lives and liberty of citizens. This is not something that can easily be done.”Brussels says the best the UK can hope for is to conclude a separate extradition treaty with the EU, as well as bilateral agreements on procedures like intelligence sharing.The row over Galileo has also been the subject of briefing and counter-briefing by the two sides. British sources briefed newspapers this week that they would demand the UK’s £1bn investment in the project back if British companies were locked out of the project. But EU sources disputed whether this stand had actually been made, describing the claim as “spin”.  The EU says British demands to retain the same access to Galileo as a member state are unreasonable. Though officials say Britain could potentially still use the system, they do not want to give British defence firms the right to build or run parts of it because they say that would effectively give the UK, a third country, the power to turn off the EU system for member states. Officials also pointed out that the UK itself had signed off the security rules restricting non-EU countries from running parts of system, as one of the 28 European Council members, before it knew it was going to leave.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who is travelling to Europe to drum up support for the UK to keep access to the satellite system, said: “Today we set out more detail on how we think the UK, as a third country, can continue to cooperate with the EU on security and keep our people safe and prosperous. As I travel around member states I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability. Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”The senior EU official said they shared the UK’s concerns but that “this is a consequence on the UK position and it is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Officials say mutual recognition is not possible outside the single market, because it would amount to asking “the EU to trust the UK more, with less guarantees, than they trust each other”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has said Theresa May’s red lines mean Britain can only get a free trade agreement similar to the ones the EU has with Canada and South Korea, but the UK said today that this “shallow level of cooperation” was “inconsistent with our ambition”, which would require “a more formal and deeper institutional structure”.A UK Government source said:  “This is their public negotiating position, nothing more, nothing less. We presented 7 papers this week, in the interests of resolving difficult issues in the interests of both sides, so the claim we aren’t providing enough detail is laughable. “The risk is that if they follow down this track, putting conditions on our unconditional offers and trying to insult us, the EU will end up with a relationship with its third biggest economy and largest security partner that lets down millions of citizens in the EU and UK.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

However, they held off from rate hike to 0.5 per cent in May on the basis of the surprise GDP figures and want to see more data confirming their view that the slump is temporary.Mr Carney, conceded on Thursday that there might be deeper problems in the economy. “The weakness in demand at the start of the year could reflect a worsening of the underlying economic climate, not the temporary effects of adverse weather as the Committee currently assesses ... there is a risk that households could opt to save rather than spend as their real incomes recover,” he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

Let’s not just put our trust in “hope”.They were massacred by an Islamist extremist radicalised by the UK’s largest jihadist network. Up to 25,000 live among us, with 3,000 a direct threat and 500 under constant surveillance.Yes, we should mourn. But let us also resolve to give our security services every penny they need to keep us safe.Let us lock away terror plotters for decades.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches.

The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further.

They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An 83,000 increase in the year was enough to see Romania leapfrog Ireland into second place.Polish remains the most common non-British nationality – with an estimated one million.There are more Poles than any other nationality in every single region of the UK – from 108,000 in the east Midlands to 63,000 in the south West.Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migration Watch, said: “There is still no sign of a net outflow of EU-born people as a result of Brexit.“Indeed they are still coming in significant numbers and contributing to a population increase which is simply unsustainable.”The ONS showed how immigration has transformed towns across the UK with migrants now accounting for 29 per cent of the population in Boston, Lincs – up from just 3 per cent in 2007.East Staffordshire’s migration population has soared from 3 per cent to 17 per cent.Nearly six out of every 10 people living in Newham, East London – 57 per cent – were born outside the UK.The ONS pointed out there are more Indians and Pakistanis than Romanians by country of birth – but many have since taken up British citizenship.THE Brexit vote appears to have triggered a huge spike in EU nationals seeking a British passport.Some 40,014 applied in the year to the end of March, nearly double the previous year, official figures reveal.A total of 14,137 were from the EU8 bloc, including Poland and Hungary.Ex-PM David Cameron lifted immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria in 2014 and numbers have soared ever since.Experts claim many Romanians and Bulgarians have come to the UK to fill the gaps left by Poles beginning to return home. There were just 78,000 Romanians living in the UK in 2010, putting it 15th below Bangladesh.Separate Home Office figures today revealed 148,000 National Insurance registrations were given out to Romanians in the year to March - a third of all those handed out to EU nationals.The Home Office said the number of foreign national offenders removed in the 12 months to March fell 11 per cent to 5,630.Last year, Romania threatened to block Brexit altogether unless Theresa May gave its country’s residents a guarantee of UK citizenship.The first Romanian to arrive in the UK to work after Mr Cameron relaxed controls – Victor Spirescu – died in a car crash this January.The man – dubbed the “poster boy” for Romanian immigration – was found to have taken cocaine when he lost control of a car near Newport Pagnell.Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nip000407435715.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince philip cracked rib harry meghan wedding","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh - who was photographed with what looked like black eyes last Saturday - slipped while washing.The accident happened only days after he had thrown his crutches away following a hip op.The 96-year-old had been hailed a hero for making it to the Royal Wedding without crutches just six weeks after surgery.But a Royal insider said despite sustaining the painful rib injury he refused even the aid of a stick on Meghan and Harry’s big day.They told The Sun: “The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe.

It’s very rare for a fractured rib not to cause pain - even a tiny fracture.“Because your ribs move when you breathe, every breath you take can be painful.“Painkillers are often not very effective but it is possible to get a local anaesthetic injected into the area to deaden the pain temporarily.”Prince Philip had spent days walking up and down stairs to get himself fit for the wedding after his hip replacement.Such was the speed of his recovery he was even warned to slow it down.Family biographer Penny Junor described his walk into the chapel - not even with a limp as “completely heroic”.She said: “Given that he is 96 years old and the operation was just six weeks ago, I think that shows what an extraordinary man he is.“That will have meant a huge amount to Prince Harry.

The scathing attack emerged last night from Brussels after the UK government warned it would want cash back from a space programme.  Mrs May\u0027s government made the threat in an ongoing row over the Galileo satellite system, which will soon be an EU rival to US-based GPS. EU officials are trying to block Britain from the programme after Brexit on security grounds, even though the UK has been a major contributor. This has enraged Tory ministers, who yesterday published demands for a \u0026pound1billion refund if they are excluded. Last night an EU official accused Britain of chasing a fantasy and said: The EU doesn’t negotiate under threat.  Such a request for reimbursement would be backsliding and unacceptable.” The row is so deep it has prompted a rare backlash from the UK\u0027s leading Brexit negotiator. Civil servant Olly Robbins, who reports directly to Theresa May, took to Twitter for the first time in nearly two years to praise Britain\u0027s calm approach - a thinly-veiled dig at the EU. He tweeted: Very proud of the x-Government team that worked so hard to support technical talks in Brussels this week. UK proposals for a deep relationship, calmly and professionally presented.   The EU official spoke to Brussels-based British journalists last night. They said: I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU side so everything can stay the same for the UK. The pre-condition for fruitful discussions is that the UK accepts the consequences of its own decision... rather than chasing the fantasy of denying the consequences of Brexit. The sooner we get away from this fantasy, the sooner we can talk about the future relationship. UK government sources hit back swiftly with one telling the : We\u0027ve heard it all before. Another told Politico: We are dealing with 10,000 German lawyers, what do you expect? They have got to wise up. This cannot be about punishment any more, it has to be about mutual benefit.

Kimberley Davis, 36, got a shock she went to wash off her fake tan and discovered the sports logo of her leggings she had worn to the gym had been imprinted into her leg. Kimberley had applied overnight fake tan but when she woke up she got a surprise when she realised the Adidas logo from her gym leggings had stamped onto her leg - two tones darker than the rest of her body. In a sheer panic, Kimberley, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, rapidly applied more fake tan. However, despite her immediate action the logo still remained printed in her leg, leaving her no other choice but to wear trousers in the sweltering temperatures.  Kimberley said: “I knew that the weather was looking great for the next few days so I decided to buy some extra dark fake tan mousse. “I applied it as usual the night before, but ran out of time in the morning to wash it off, so quickly headed to the gym. “When I got home and went to wash the tan off I saw that the tan was darker in parts, and spelt out ‘Adidas’. “I tried as hard as I could to get it off, but it just wouldn’t budge, so now I’m stuck in long trousers in this boiling weather!”  Despite her best effort in piling on more fake tan, Kimberley admits that it was too late and the damage was already done. She said: “I tried to cover up the logo as best as I could with more tan, but I can still faintly see the outline so I’ll have to stick to trousers. “I might wear a dress around town, but the logo is so obvious that it’s likely that people will recognise it. “I don’t know what happened, whether it was the fact I was hot and working out that made it darker in those parts, or that the materials didn’t mix together.

Shane O\u0027Brien, 30, is alleged to have killed Josh Hanson in an unprovoked knife attack in a bar in Hillingdon, west London, in 2015. O\u0027Brien fled in the wake of Mr Hanson\u0027s death and was thought to be in the Netherlands and United Arab Emirates before returning to Europe. He changed his appearance and then went on the run in private jets, boats and helicopters.  He has been placed on Interpol\u0027s worldwide most wanted list and there is also a \u0026pound50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and prosecution. Police say he is dangerous and should not be approached. Mr Hanson\u0027s mother Tracey and his sister Brooke said: Our lives will never be the same without Josh and I would not wish our living nightmare on anyone, it is a pain that no words alone can describe.  Someone somewhere also knows where O\u0027Brien is and can change the pain and uncertainty that each day brings for us.  We ask you to try and imagine the emptiness that we have been left to live with, please, please, please do the right thing and make that call or encourage someone else to. The politan Police say O\u0027Brien was flown out of the UK on a privately chartered plane from Biggin Hill Airport. He was arrested in Prague for criminal damage and assault in February last year under the Italian alias Enzo Mellonceli and released on bail.  Police say he has been travelling extensively and there were reported sightings in Gibraltar, Nice in France and Prague following an appeal for information in October last year. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: Based on what we know about O\u0027Brien\u0027s lifestyle and interests, we are looking to people in nightclubs and boxing gyms as well as expats and any women he may have become involved with to come forward. Please do not assume that someone else will call in, what you perceive to be a small piece of information could in fact be the missing piece of the jigsaw that gets justice for Josh. He added: Everyone wants to give Josh\u0027s mum Tracey and his sister Brooke the news they so desperately need to hear. As the months go by, the lack of justice only adds to their heartbreak. Josh was an amazing young man with his whole life ahead of him and Tracey and Brooke miss him desperately. They need to see O\u0027Brien brought to justice.

Tyler Cail had been enjoying a weekend with his dad Mark, 36, when tragedy struck. They fell asleep together at the home in Hull but when Tyler woke up in the early hours needing the toilet, he could not rouse his dad. The following morning, Tyler still could not wake his dad but when he noticed blood pouring out of his nose, he reached for his dad\u0027s phone and called mum. Mr Cail’s mum, who lives in Leeds, picked up the phone and immediately called police and paramedics after listening to the youngster’s horrifying account of what had happened, reports Hull Live.  Tyler handed the house keys to paramedics through the letterbox who went straight to the master bedroom, but tragically Mr Cail was already dead. Mr Cail\u0027s death has devastated his family, including Tyler’s mum and Mr Cail’s ex-partner Donna Yates, who said her little boy has had to receive counselling following the heartbreaking ordeal. The 27-year-old said: “I didn’t believe it and I’m still struggling to now. It just doesn’t seem real and it’s my little boy I think about in all of this. “It was extremely heartbreaking to think he had to witness that. He has his good days and his bad days but we don’t really like to think about it because we are trying to move on.” The day before Mr Cail’s death, the pair went to an aquarium in Hull called The Deep - one of their “favourite places” to spend time together - before they returned home. Although Miss Yates and her ex split up for good after an on-off relationship in July 2017, the couple always put their little boy first. She said: “Mark was a brilliant dad and he just did anything he could for him. He was always there playing darts with him and taking him out to places. He was just a typical, good dad. “We are always thinking of him. He misses him and loves him and will always be ‘his champ.’”  Mr Cail, who used to work as a freelance photographer, had been suffering with intense pain after a road traffic accident in January 2017 left him with a pelvis fracture. He was known to be a heavy drinker, sometimes drinking up to 14 cans of lager a night. He also suffered from high blood pressure and mental health problems. After the accident, Mr Cail was given prescribed medication to help him cope with the pain he was experiencing. However, he often found himself struggling to get to sleep, which made him turn towards drink as a coping mechanism.

Sandra Holmes took her World War II veteran father, 93-year-old John Lenton, out of a residential home to board a plane to visit Dignitas to end his life on October 25.  Today, she has broken her silence on the emotional decision and why she accompanied her father to the clinic in an exclusive interview with the Daily Post.  Assisted suicide, in which dying person takes an active role in ending their own life, is legal in Switzerland but is a crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She and her son, Scott, are still awaiting a decision by the CPS on whether they will be charged with a crime or not after they travelled with him to Switzerland.  John\u0027s death was reported to North Wales Police who are duty bound to investigate their role. Sandra, a former nursery nurse from Llanrwst in Wales, has revealed the family\u0027s emotional ordeal but also their strong belief in the right to die. She said: “This is my dad’s story, not mine. And I am telling it now as we strongly believe in everyone’s individual choice to make their own decisions at the end of their life.” John Lenton John Lenton was a proud and private man who had lived a full and active life. He was was born and brought up in Newport, South Wales and from there, he joined the Army. John\u0027s life in the armed forces started off as a soldier in the South Wales Borderers before he volunteered to join the Parachute Regiment, rising to Colour Sergeant. He fought in Italy, Algeria, Tunisia, France, Greece, Palestine and Egypt. He was also part of the forerunner to the SAS. Married to Jeanne, they lived in London after John left the Army and their only child Sandra was born in 1952. An active person all his life, he climbed and walked the hills and mountains. John was head hunted by Quinton Hazel where he worked as a production control manager and moved to Nebo with his wife 39 years ago.  Sandra described him as a “massively intelligent man.” She said: Mathematics, quantum physics, the historic movement of peoples and languages – these were not only his life but what he read to relax. “He was independent in the extreme, renovating their old cottage in the hills himself – from the roof to the smallest screw was done entirely by Dad. “He was very physical, clever but also a very private man – his family was his life, we were very close.” Once the couple retired, they bought a touring caravan and would spend three months of the year in Scotland. They were married for 64 years until Jeanne died in 2011. As John aged, his physical health started to deteriorate and following a hernia operation in 2011, he required a permanent catheter which at that stage he dealt with himself. He was extremely deaf and wore two hearing aids. In early 2017, he became bowel incontinent and his hearing worsened. He battled on, but Parkinson’s disease also had him in its grip and he fell several times. This often left him in hospital and he could not move from his chair without help. The final straw came last year when he was diagnosed with eye disorder dry macular degeneration, which was causing him to go blind, taking away his only remaining pleasure - watching his beloved news, nature programmes and sport on television. Sandra, who is semi-retired, became am carer for her father. She would visit him countless times throughout the day and he moved to be closer to her.  She said: “The total indignity of having his daughter care for him, changing and cleaning him was, for him, so humiliating. “Followed by young people (carers) – excellent though they were – cleaning and changing him was just so awful for a man that held privacy and independence so dear.” She added: “All of my adult life I have known that my mum and dad believed strongly in the right to die when you had reached a stage where you had no quality of life left. We all believe the same. “So in the spring of 2017, Dad asked me if we would be willing to accompany him to Switzerland to Dignitas, I was not surprised at all. “We talked about it many times and I spoke to Scott and my partner Ted as well. “We all agreed that if that was his wish then we would do this for him. “At no time did he have any doubts.” The journey to Dignitas The process was a long and arduous one taking seven months to plan. John needed a passport for a start, but in the meantime, his health continued to decline and then Scott suffered a stroke at the age of 40. Looking after them both left Sandra exhausted. The family decided that the best thing to do was to move John into a home and he was offered an emergency place at Cartref Bryn yr Eglwys in Pentrefoelas. Sandra said: “We all knew that was the best thing to do because Dad would be cared for while I was helping Scott. I’ve nothing but praise for the staff there. “But we also knew it would only be a short term measure.  “Dad never said a word about our plans the whole time he was there, he was mentally ahead of us all. “But for me, the emotional stress of carrying on a normal daily life and not being able to confide in anyone about what we were going to do was sometimes overwhelming.” The pensioner would go on to spend a month-and-a-half being cared for at the Pentrefoelas home before his daughter and grandson were ready to put their plan into action. Scott said: “We told the home we were taking Grandad on holiday in the UK for five days, we needed to find a reason to take him out of there without arising suspicion. “The care home called a doctor to assess whether he was well enough, and after a long talk with him, the GP decided that not only was he fit to travel, but he was more than capable of making his own decisions.” But that was just the start of the obstacles they would face. Sandra said: “It’s all very nerve wracking, it isn’t the easy process that some people think. “You are on pins and even getting to the airport was a nightmare because the law here can stop you leaving the country and you can be arrested. “Because of this, we hired a car so that our car couldn’t be followed or tracked to the airport, this is the lengths that the law drives you to. “Even though everything was in place, you are living in fear that you will be stopped and that the person you love so much will be left stuck in a half life they don’t want. “There is no feeling of safety until that plane takes off.” As John’s needs were complex, travel was not easy as he was in a wheelchair and the family booked assisted travel to ease the time spent in the airport. The whole process was increasingly stressful with the family worried someone somewhere had alerted the police and they could get a tap on the shoulder at any moment. Sandra added: “In your heart you know that no one could possibly know and stop us but you don’t relax until the aeroplane doors are closed and it starts taxiing down the runway. “And not because of the consequences for Scott and I, if they arrested us, we’d cope with it, but because it would scupper the plan and Dad would go on suffering. “From an emotional point of view, however difficult it was, we knew we were doing it because it was what Dad wanted.” In Switzerland Keeping conversation to a minimum due to John’s poor hearing, it wasn’t until the trio got to their hotel in Switzerland before they could finally speak openly about Dignitas. But even then, doctors had to assess whether they believed John was in the right mind to go through with it. Sandra explained: “You have to be in Switzerland for two consecutive days before you can go to the clinic, and an independent doctor has to come out both days and make sure it’s what the patient wants, and that they know why they are there, and that they are happy to continue with the course of action. “If the doctor has any doubts or feels they are under any pressure, then they will call the whole thing off.” But those two days gave the family time to relax and chat, and Sandra and Scott were able to find out where John wanted his ashes scattered. Sandra recalled: “Dad was able to have perfectly intelligent conversations and the thing that I found strange was that I thought two days in a hotel room would be a long haul with Dad not being able to do much, when actually, it was quite nice because the pressure was off.  You’re in a country where you can say why you’re there and what you’re doing, so there was a feeling of complete relief and we had time to sit and chat. “We talked about Dad’s wishes for his funeral and what he wanted to happen afterwards. “We discussed a place where he and my mum loved and he asked that their ashes be scattered together. “If we hadn’t had those two days, we never would have pinned down all the details. “It sounds weird but it was actually quite a pleasant time, Dad looked 10 years younger and you could see the weight had gone from his shoulders because we’d made it there and it was going to be ok.” Scott added: “You could see a dramatic change in his whole demeanour, he was very relaxed and happy to be there. “His main and major concern was what would happen to us when we came back but that was something we were prepared to deal with later.” John\u0027s final day They took John on his final visit to the clinic on October 25. Scott said: “The day is very practical to start with because you have to arrange taxis and transport to get there. “They’re lovely people there, very understanding, it’s quiet and secluded and they sit you around a table to talk you through everything that’s going to happen, all the while they are reassuring, making sure the person understands and that there are no surprises.  “You still have to fill out lots of paperwork and Grandad had to sign so many forms when we got there, it’s a misconception that you just take people there and they pop off. “Grandad was just so glad it was happening, he just wanted it to be over.” Sandra and Scott described the apartment room as homely with a couch, coffee table, bed and a couple of chairs. Relatives are able to sit and talk for as long as they like, but John was keen to press on. “He was the most relaxed I’d seen him in years because it was finally happening and his suffering was coming to an end,” said Sandra. “He didn’t have to put up with carers young enough to be his granddaughter changing his nappy, as he called it. “You could see it was all just stopping.” The family recalled how they “waited quietly” as the pensioner was given an anti-sickness drink, followed by a lethal powdered drug dissolved in a glass of water. Within 15 minutes, John had drifted out of consciousness and into a coma before peacefully passing away. “It was just like watching him fall asleep,” remembered Sandra. “The staff leave the room and come back into the background when it’s over, it’s all handled very sensitively. “It’s peaceful, there’s no pain or agony and no dying frightened like some people do in hospital. “It’s just calm and dignified and so much what Dad wanted and what he had planned.” Sandra and Scott admitted it was strange dealing with the range of emotions afterwards. “It’s the strangest combination of feelings, you’re upset because your loved one’s just died, but there’s a relief for him that he is set free from what he was suffering from,” said Scott. “There’s a gladness that it’s over - all overridden by the fact that he’s gone. “You feel guilty because you feel glad, it’s very strange, you just feel resolute.” Coming home They didn’t shy away from telling close friends and family when they got home to North Wales. “For the first time, we could be honest and tell people what had happened and actually talk about what we all believed in. “It didn’t matter what happened to us because of it, because we’re tough enough to cope, the main thing was, Dad couldn’t be affected anymore and that was my overriding feeling, along with exhaustion.” But Sandra and Scott had to prepare themselves to face any consequences and after informing the care home of John’s death in Switzerland, North Wales Police were notified. Under UK law, it is a crime to encourage or assist a suicide, and the offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.  With end of life choice limited under current UK law, it is believed up to 10 British citizens a month choose to die at the Swiss clinic, which was set up in 1998. According to the charity Dignity In Dying, prosecution is less likely when the person had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to end their life and the person suspected of assisting them was wholly motivated by compassion. Scott said: “Although we’d done so much research around Dignitas, you can’t find out what’s going to happen to you afterwards, you can’t ask anyone or pop into a police station. “But no one has ever been prosecuted on their return to the UK before. “If Grandad hadn’t have been in a care home, and we’d have taken him there from his flat, no one would have been any the wiser, all you have to do is register the death certificate.” Sandra added: “The law here is so antiquated. I think Dad’s concern was that we’d step onto British soil and be arrested immediately, it was never going to happen, lots of people go to Dignitas. “It’s a very caring organisation and offers tremendous support, indeed it was the only support.” North Wales and the CPS Assisted suicide, in which the dying person takes an active role in ending their own life, is legal in Switzerland but is a crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland under the 1961 Suicide Act. It carries a penalty of up to 14 years in jail. John Lenton’s death was reported to North Wales Police who were duty bound to investigate Sandra and Scott’s role. She is currently awaiting a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service on whether it is in the public interest to prosecute them. Sandra said: “The police have been wonderful. They didn’t have an option but to investigate it but they’ve been very understanding and handled it with great care.

Like all her in-laws, the new Duchess of Sussex now has a dedicated area of the site featuring photos and details of her life and passions. However the page was criticised for brushing over her successful acting career, focusing only on her charity work. Her career, including her starring role in the US TV show Suits, and her education did feature on the site but only on the secondary biography page. But the site, which is run by staff at Buckingham Palace has now been changed and her personal achievements before becoming a royal are now featured on the home page.  Previously, under the heading \u0027About the Duchess of Sussex\u0027 the website stated: From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues and actively participated in charitable work. Aged 11 she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. Her Royal Highness also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles from the age of 13-17. She continued to volunteer at the soup kitchen when she would return home to Los Angeles until the age of 22. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women\u0027s empowerment. While filming in Toronto, The Duchess actively volunteered at a Canadian soup kitchen from 2011-2013. She also established the program at her place of work to ensure that leftover meals from the set were donated to local homeless shelters. This line was the only reference to her career on the front page. However now her education and career are at the top underneath a short piece of blurb about her wedding day and royal duties.  The content is all the same, it\u0027s just been moved from the secondary page to the main page. A spokesman from Kensington Palace told  the changes were only made for formatting and design reasons and not because of the content itself. Under the \u0027Career\u0027 title there is a photo of Meghan in her role as paralegal Rachel Zane in Suits, with the words: After university Her Royal Highness worked as an actress, appearing in film and television.  She most notably played the role of Rachel Zane on the series Suits for seven seasons, completing over 100 episodes.    Whilst working on Suits, The Duchess moved to Toronto, Canada where the show was filmed she feels very connected to Canada, as it became a second home to her.

Nathan Guilfoyle, who passed his test in January, has slammed the estimate on his 2004 Ford Fiesta from Allianz as unfair.  The 18-year-old told the Irish Mirror : “My original reaction was that it was really unfair rather than being shocked.  “You do expect high enough prices but when it came to that one, I thought, ‘OK €6,000, €5000, I can see why they might go high enough. “But when I saw €16,785.01 (\u0026pound14,701), which is eight times what the car is worth, I just thought it was unfair.” The Leaving Cert student, who has a clean licence and never been involved in a crash, said he believes some companies do not want to insure young motorists.

Philip Wallis, 63, who lives on nearby Munro Street, said locals have kept calling the council about the sinkhole after it first appeared about four months ago. He said: We kept calling the council about the problem because it got to a foot (30cm) wide. Four weeks ago now the hole was filled and tarmac covered it but now there is another hole. “We can fit our hands inside and not feel where it ends. It is very dangerous. “When something heavy like a bin lorry or a delivery wagon goes over the top, they are going to make it bigger and a car could fall inside.” Mr Wallis believes one possible explanation for the pothole is a spring in nearby Penkhull.

The plea for mercy came as the alleged burglar lay helpless at the man\u0027s feet with an obvious wound to the back of his head. This clip, which surfaced on a private social media group last night, is believed to have been filmed in Durham. Some on social media have praised the man\u0027s actions, but others condemned the violence he meted out. The footage begins with a man wearing grey jogging bottoms, a khaki top and baseball cap opening a gate at the back of a property.  The man kicks the wooden gate open, and a man wearing a blue polo shirt can be seen standing frozen in front of a door. The man in the baseball cap walks straight up to him and lands a violent punch on his head, causing him to drop to the ground instantly. Within seconds, the attacker violently kicks the man on the ground in the head and then in the chest before saying: “F*** off, get up and f*** off, c***.” The man in the cap then grabs the man on the ground by his top and drags him along the concrete floor, tripping over him as he tries to pull him out of the gate. A sickening thud can be heard as the man on the ground’s head slams into the wooden gate, while the man in the cap grabs the man by the top of his trousers. He picks him up and throws him head first out of the property, and the man in the cap can be heard saying: “Get out, I’m f****** telling ya. Get the f*** off away from me now.”  As the man lies on the ground with his top pulled up and his trousers pulled down slightly, the other man can be heard saying: “Get up and f*** off. Get up.” The man on the ground appears to have an open wound on the top of his head while he lies there and can be heard saying: “I’m sorry.” However, before he can, the man in the cap brutally kicks him hard in the stomach and then in the face, sending the man’s head lolling backwards. The disorientated man can be heard saying: “Right, right, I’m sorry.” The clip ends with the man trying to get up, before it flicks to a shot of a messenger app. The words “Bro I gotta stop the juice. I’ve f* up big time.” can be seen on the screen above the clip.

Forecasters are even warning that, once the rain clears, it could be the hottest early May Bank Holiday weekend ever with temperatures hitting 30C. It will be warmest in the South East but the rest of the UK will experience glorious sunshine as well. The previous record set in late May was 32.8C, which was recorded in Horsham in 1944 on a Monday. Martin Young, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There is a 50/50 chance we may see the warmest day of the year so far at some point towards the end of the weekend.” If the temperatures do break 30C it will also make it the warmest day of the year, beating with 29.1C taken on April 19 in St. James Park, London.  But before it heats up motorists looking to get away today are at risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms. There will be lots of cloud and heavy showers or longer spells of rain for the Midlands, Wales and northern England throughout Friday. It will be drier in the South East but it could still rain. But Saturday will be largely sunny for most, but with the risk of sharp showers for central and southern areas. The heaviest and most widespread showers are expected over south-west England, especially in the afternoon.  Sunday will be sunny for many northern and eastern parts, although there will be thundery showers again for central and southern portions of Britain. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page added: “There is a risk of potentially severe thunderstorms during the Bank Holiday weekend. Saturday: Rain in northern England will ease to leave many fine and very warm. Southern and southwestern areas will see further thundery showers, whilst coasts in northeast Scotland could remain misty. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Very warm over the Bank Holiday weekend with plenty of sunshine, especially in the northwest. Scattered thunderstorms in the south, especially on Sunday. Mist returning to eastern coasts from Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"well pay price forever mum","story":"News\u0027We\u0027ll pay the price forever\u0027: Mum describes life-changing moment learner driver dragged son, 5, under car leaving him brain damagedBobby Hughes, now six, was taken to hospital in an air ambulance piloted by Prince William after he was struck by inexperienced Eleanor Cass\u0027 car and dragged along the pavement\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Lumby13:48, 25 MAY 2018NewsMum Carly said Bobby [pictured] has \u0027been to hell and back\u0027 since the crash\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum of a five-year-old boy who was left with brain damage after being hit by a learner driver says her family will be ‘paying the price’ for the rest of their lives. Bobby Hughes, now six, was playing outside his house when he was struck by a car driven by Eleanor Cass, of Hertford, who had only nine hours of driving practice and had mistaken the accelerator for the brake. The child has undergone multiple brain surgeries and still needs round-the-clock care as the crash has left him unable to move or talk as before. Cass, 26, was jailed on May 23, after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving on April 18. Bobby\u0027s mum Carly Easter, who was good friends with Eleanor Cass\u0027 sister, said: Bobby and her nephew used to play outside the house. It was a beautiful little cul-de-sac the kids could play and be free. Eleanor knew that but she took it upon herself to drive.  Carly said that Cass had been to pick up her nephew from school on the day of the accident and that witnesses said she didn\u0027t have much control of the car. The mother-of-three continued: Why would you practice on a cul-de-sac where you know kids are going to be? Just five minutes before the accident, Carly explained how she called football mad Bobby into the house to tell him that his dad had bought tickets to go and see Tottenham Hotspur. She said: He was so excited to tell all his friends. Bobby went back outside and then, moments later, he was struck by the car. Carly said: She dragged him along. He was wedged under the car. He was lying there lifeless in a puddle of blood dying.  One of Bobby\u0027s sisters, who is now 11-years-old, was with him when it happened and started screaming. He was rushed to hospital in Saffron Walden and was then taken by air ambulance - piloted by Prince William - to Addenbrooke\u0027s Hospital in Cambridge. He spent four months at the hospital and then a further four at the Children\u0027s Trust, which is a specialist rehabilitation centre for brain injuries. My poor son has been to hell and back, said Carly. He\u0027s got to have three more surgeries. Speaking of Bobby\u0027s prospects of recovery, she said: With a brain injury you just don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve got a long and hard road ahead of us but we just don\u0027t know. Asked about Cass\u0027 sentence, she said: Nothing\u0027s ever going to be enough but I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve got some sort of of justice. I\u0027m hoping that she\u0027s got time now to think about what she\u0027s done, that her dangerous driving has caused this injury. Coming out of court, I slept well for the first time.

Emilia Wickstead claims the gown created especially for Meghan and Harry\u0027s big day is exactly the same as a \u0026pound7,000 one in her collection.  The Givenchy gown , designed by Clare Waight Keller was kept under wraps for months and reportedly required several secret meetings.  Dashing across London in a baseball cap or beanie, Meghan and Clare ran a covert operation in the lead up to the big day. But now Emilia has made some extraordinary claims about the dress - that was rumoured to cost between \u0026pound200,000 and \u0026pound387,000.  She said: Her dress is identical to one of our dresses. Apparently a lot of commentators were saying \u0027It\u0027s an Emilia Wickstead dress.\u0027 But that wasn\u0027t the only thing she slated - as she laid into the fit of the dress and even Meghan\u0027s hair on the day. She told the Daily Mail: If you choose a simple design the fit should be perfect. Her wedding dress was quite loose. Moving onto her hair, she said: I was like \u0027Hold the wisps (of her hair) back. It\u0027s a Royal Wedding for God\u0027s sake.\u0027  Meghan, the now Duchess of Sussex, looked stunning on her wedding day last Saturday. She accompanied her dress with a 16ft-veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British commonwealth and the Queen Mary\u0027s tiara, which she borrowed from The Queen. Birmingham-born mum of three Clare was on hand on the steps to make final adjustments to Meghan\u0027s gown and veil before handing her into the care of the page boys who showed off the 15 ft veil to such effect. She said: I wanted just for her to feel and look amazing. It was just an important moment to get all of that right and I thought she just looked spectacular, she said.  Asked about the moment Meghan was able to look at herself fully dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Clare said: She was just glowing. There\u0027s so much emotion on a day like that anyway. But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think it is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant. She said it was confirmed to her in early January that she was the chosen designer. It was an extraordinary moment when she told me.  Of course it\u0027s an incredible thing to be part of such a historic moment, she said.  People also said previously said the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s gown reminded them of the dress J-Lo wore in 2001 film The Wedding Planner, pointing to the similar elegant off-the-shoulder neckline.   And others claimed the new Duchess of Sussex copied the idea from another royal .   Channel Nine presenter Allison Langdon made the accusation during her royal wedding coverage.  She said: It was Princess Mary. My first thought when I saw it was, we\u0027ve actually seen that before so I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll be setting wedding trends because I think she\u0027s copied.

Sophie Lionnet, 21, was starved, beaten, whipped with a cable and left with a broken chestbone ribs before being drowned in a bath. Her killers Sabrina Kouider, 35, and partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, were yesterday found guilty of murder. Police found a note written by a starving Sophie in the tiny, dark room where she was forced to sleep. It read simply: Why me? I need help to stop them. The victim\u0027s dad Patrick Lionnet, 56, told The Times: I will never hear her say \u0027daddy, I\u0027m getting married\u0027 or \u0027daddy, I\u0027m going to have a baby\u0027.  Those people are not human, they are barbaric. They have no humanity in them at all. And her mum Catherine Devallonne, 49, said: They took away her dignity and finally her life painfully ebbed away, until Sophie struggled to take her last breath in that bath. Kouider and Medouni had a twisted obsession with Boyzone founder Mark Walton, Kouider\u0027s ex, and wrongly accused Miss Lionnet of conspiring with him. Her burnt body was eventually found on the couple\u0027s patio when firefighters were called to reports of foul-smelling smoke. In chilling audio recordings, captured on Kouider\u0027s phone, they could be heard firing questions at their terrified victim during the interrogation sessions, which took place over 12 days before her murder.  The violent questioning was conducted by the duo in a bid to force the nanny to confess to various false crimes. In the weeks leading up to her death in September last year, the couple beat, starved and tortured the shy 21-year-old by dunking her head into water. Having killed her in the bath, the pair threw her on a bonfire in the garden of their home near Wimbledon, south-west London, as they barbecued chicken nearby. The body was discovered when firefighters were alerted by neighbours to pungent-smelling smoke, but Medouni tried to pass off the charred remains as a sheep. And Kouider claimed to police that Miss Lionnet had run off with ex-byofriend Mr Walton in an attempt to frame him for her disappearance.  The defendants later admitted disposing of her body but denied Miss Lionnet\u0027s murder, blaming each other for her death. An Old Bailey jury found both of them guilty of the murder following a two-month trial that was described as stranger than fiction. Miss Lionnet\u0027s parents travelled from France to see the disturbing evidence as it unfolded. The court heard how fashion designer Kouider was fixated with her ex-boyfriend Mr Walton. After splitting up after two years, Kouider reported him to police more than 30 times and received a caution for branding him a paedophile on a fake Facebook profile.  She also accused him of sexually abusing a cat, using black magic and hiring a helicopter to spy on her. Giving evidence, LA-based Mr Walton said he had been in love with Kouider but she would flip and go crazy for no reason. Another ex-boyfriend Anthony Francois described her as a lunatic, fickle and unstable. Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Miss Lionnet was slapped, likened to a Nazi collaborator and called worse than a murderer by her tormentors. Kouider, who claimed to know influential people including US President Donald Trump, threatened to have her locked up and even marched her to a police station.  The victim\u0027s distraught mother had begged Kouider to send her daughter home but she refused. In her final days, Miss Lionnet was hit with an electrical cable and beaten so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. In a filmed forced confession, the emaciated and broken young woman claimed she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. Within hours, she was dead. Before the trial, Medouni claimed Miss Lionnet died by accident after he punched her during an interrogation in the bath. He offered to admit manslaughter but later retracted his confession, saying he made it to protect his wife, who has been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.

fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlaymaker Scott Fraser looks set for a switch to England after announcing he’s quitting Dundee United.Burton Albion, looking to rebuild after relegation from the Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west coast, could be set for a return to Tannadice as part of the shake-up to the youth set-up that’s taking place this summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/02/5a86c4d42bb4d-e1518786790343.jpg ","title":"council apologise for handling of road closures ahead of bbcs

July 14 – the day before the World Cup Final – today\u0026#8217s draw for the third year of the revamped League Cup sees teams split into north and south sections, drawn together in eight groups of five.Dundee will come out of pot one in the north section while United are second seeds meaning there’s a decent chance of a repeat of last year’s draw.The two met in Group C with the Tangerines topping the section, a point ahead of the Dark Blues after a penalty shootout win following a 1-1 draw gave them a bonus point.They were paired again in round two with the Dens men seeing off their neighbours and pushing into the quarter-final.Alongside Dundee as first seeds in the north section are St Johnstone, Hearts and Ross County meaning they can’t be paired together.Each of them will face either United, Dunfermline, Inverness CT or Falkirk from pot two alongside three unseeded sides.Those are Brechin City, Raith Rovers, Alloa Athletic, Arbroath, East Fife, Forfar Athletic, Montrose, Peterhead, Stirling Albion, Elgin City, Cowdenbeath and Cove Rangers.In the south section, recently-relegated Partick Thistle can come up against Livingston again, just weeks after losing out in the Premiership play-off to David Hopkin’s men.Top seeds in that section are Partick, Kilmarnock, Hamilton and Motherwell with Livi, St Mirren, Queen of the South and Morton in pot two.The draw takes

All in just one year for this happy couple!Kayleigh Petrie, 22, and Aaron Ogilvie, 23, met when they were just 11 at the carnival but the pair only became a couple after Kayleigh picked Aaron up from a night out just over four years ago.Aaron, an auxiliary worker, said: “From the night that Kayleigh picked me up we were together, although it took me months to officially ask her out!”Three years later the pair were shocked to find out that Kayleigh was pregnant after originally being told that a natural conception would not be possible.Kayleigh, a social care worker, said: “We didn’t expect me to get pregnant as I was told I couldn’t have children because I have endometriosis.“However, I did fall pregnant naturally and I even had to cancel an operation to have my eggs removed that I had been waiting more than a year for.“It was a massive shock but an amazing one.”The Coldside couple welcomed beautiful baby Oak Ogilvie on March 19, weighing a healthy 7lb 10oz.Following five days in hospital, the new family arrived home and although Kayleigh and Aaron admit parenthood is hard, they say it is all worth it.When Oak was eight weeks old, she donned the family christening gown that her mum and many other relatives going back almost 50 years had worn and was christened at St Martin’s Church in the Hilltown.The surprises kept coming at the reception as Aaron decided to get down on one knee and propose to Kayleigh – although it almost did not happen.Aaron said: “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to propose that day as a family friend was buying the ring on a trip to Dubai and was only returning home on the same day as the christening.“I was so nervous as I am not a speaker anyway and I was worried the ring wasn’t going to arrive.“I was even sick outside due to nerves. Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked. I didn’t expect it at all.“If I had known I would have battered him.“It was amazing that our families were there to see it because family is so important.“There are now five generations in my family so it was really special.“My mum kindly looked after Oak that night so we were able to go out in the Ferry and celebrate.”The couple are now busy planning their wedding in 2020, which they hope can be on the same date as their engagement.“I can’t wait for the wedding,” said Kayleigh. “Oak will be two when it comes around so she will be our flower girl and she will be able to walk down the aisle.”The happy family would like to thank Kayleigh’s mum Gillian for organising and paying for the christening and also uncle Paul who took all the pictures of the day.Kayleigh added: “We would also like to say a massive thank you to all of the godparents.

Nicky has tremendous ability and in addition to scoring he is also very good at reading the game,” he said.The 26-year-old had the option of staying at Dunfermline, for whom he hit 37 goals in the past two seasons, but admitted the lure of a move to Tannadice was too much to resist.“I am delighted to be joining a club of the stature of Dundee United and my main intention is to help the team get us up to the Premiership.“I am really looking forward to this new challenge in my career,” he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the

two wheels.Almost 300 pupils from primaries in Inverness and Caithness gathered to be trained in new roles as Junior Road Safety Officers (JRSO) last week.The JRSO programme in Scotland puts children in control of highlighting road safety issues for their own schoolmates.The programme is particularly empowering for the senior pupils of P6 and P7 giving them the opportunity to become JRSOs for a year.Their tasks are to organise a road safety noticeboard deliver safety presentations to classes or assemblies and run school road safety competitions.Training days were organised by Highland Council\u0027 road safety team this week at Eden Court, Inverness, and in Wick.At the training days the new JRSO\u0027 were provided with information from a number of organisations to help them undertake their roles within their schools including Highland Council, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Road Safety Scotland Breedon Sustrans and HiTrans Living Streets Police Scotland and Cycling Scotland.At the Inverness event 236 JRSOs took take part representing 57 schools, while in Wick 59 JRSOs attended the training representing 13 schools.Councillor Allan Henderson, chairman of council\u0027 environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"Saving lives is what these two very important training days were all about.\"The training provided helps senior pupils to deliver the important role of Junior Road Safety Officer in their areas.\"It empowers them to share road safety education information to their fellow pupils and encourages them to adopt sustainable travel choices and fosters a safe and healthy highland school population.\"Friday 25 May 2018 5:36

fund","story":"\u0026nbspA VOLUNTEER for the Highland Hospice has signed herself up for a gruelling 10-week transformation programme to try and raise cash for the charity.Tracey Morrison (47) had already volunteered to take part in the hospice\u0027 Rocky Mountain challenge this September when kind-hearted personal trainer Alan Goodwin offered the hospice a free place on his intense fitness programme.Mrs Morrison, of Milton Of Leys, accepted the opportunity to get fit fast in preparation for her upcoming trek even though it was completely out of her comfort zone.\"You could say that I am an unfit 47-year-old,\" she said.\"Activity isn\u0026rsquot the best for me and I had never even heard of a fitness bleep test. I thought\u0026nbsp I have to do something about my general health and lifestyle and get to a better place.\"She hopes people will follow her journey as she takes part in the Spartan 70 challenge with Mr Goodwin and donate pounds as she sheds them.\"I am hoping to lose 20 pounds over the course of 10 weeks so if people were happy to donate to match that, it would be wonderful,\" she said.She has been volunteering with the hospice since 2013 and was delighted to be chosen to take part in this fitness challenge and the Rocky Mountain Challenge, that will see her embark on a 10-day trek through the Canadian Rockies.\"It is the challenge of a lifetime and so completely out of my comfort zone,\" she said.\"I am delighted to have the opportunity.\"Mr Goodwin came up with the idea of offering a place on his course after a recent tour of the hospice facilities.\"The Spartan 70 programme has been so successful that we expanded it, doubled the number of recruits and took on another trainer,\" the 39-year-old said.\"I wanted to give something back and the hospice is just so great. They do so much with so little funding.\"He launched Alan Goodwin Personal Training three years ago and is now based in the Inverness Tennis and Squash Club but likes to take as many of his sessions outdoors as possible.He added: \"The fundraising team next door at Highland Hospice do an incredible job of keeping the place running day to day and, having received a recent tour, they offer something so meaningful.\"We are very lucky to have something like this in the area.\"He will be supporting Mrs Morrison to achieve her goals but he admitted that the programme can be tough.For 10 weeks Mrs Morrison will have to give up alcohol, submit a weekly food diary based on strict healthy-eating guidelines, attend early morning group sessions twice a week, attend weekly outdoor boot camps on Nairn Beach and Ord Hill and during this time she is not allowed to miss\u0026nbsp more than eight sessions.Anyone taking part in the programme who breaks these rules will be disqualified.\"It is really strict but I think Tracey will do really well,\" Mr Goodwin said.\"It is really successful because the people that take really want to get in great shape.\"He added: \"I really hope that people will give generously and sponsor her for her losses between now and July 22.\"Weekly updates on Mrs Morrison\u0027 progress will be posted on the Alan Goodwin Personal Training Facebook page and also the Highland Hospice\u0027 social media.To donate to Tracey Morrison\u0027 challenge visit https://www.justgiving/fundraising/tracey-morrison71\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFriday 25 May 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
