And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act‘Who are you?’ he barked menacingly, as he screwed up his eyes trying to read our chest-emblazoned nametags.‘Well sir,’ I replied, ‘I’m afraid you are currently surrounded by the tabloid press.’He stared at me like I’d just told him I’d like fried Corgi for supper, with open-mouthed disgust and revulsion radiating from every crevice of his weather-beaten face.Philip didn’t say a single further word.Instead, he brushed off my still outstretched hand, and turned abruptly left before marching off as fast as he’d arrived.A few yards on, he passed another guest and, looking back at me, loudly sneered to him: ‘My God, you just can’t tell from the outside, can you…’(Ironically, that guest was also a tabloid editor, this proving Philip’s point.)Now, I don’t blame Philip for being so damn rude to me.Parts of the wreckage from Prince Philip\u0027s crash \u0027go up for...\u0027We either receive the same treatment or we don\u0027t\u0027:...Diana\u0027s former bodyguard says the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s crash...Pictured: Mother whose baby was in the backseat during...Share this articleIf someone published endless stories about my family, many scandalous and embarrassing, then I’d be just the same if I met them too.But what staggered me was how he was prepared to be SO rude to someone who was an invited guest at his son’s birthday party.That takes some kind of brass neck.I was reminded of our extraordinary encounter over the past few days, when the whole world has got to see just how brassy Philip’s neck can really be.Last Thursday, he was involved in a serious car crash on a public road near the royal estate of Sandringham in Norfolk on the East Coast of England.Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old baby.Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist.          Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old babyHer friend, the driver, suffered minor injuries, and the baby, thankfully was unhurt.Philip, miraculously given he is 97 years old and his Land Rover rolled over onto its side, was also unhurt.He has reportedly blamed bright sunshine for temporarily blinding him, so he was unable to see the Kia coming when he pulled out into its path.Other witnesses have suggested it was a cloudy day, and the more likely explanation is his old age impaired his ability to drive.Frankly, I don’t believe ANY 97-year-old should be allowed to drive a car – especially if they have a whole array of servants and bodyguards who can do it for them.But that’s not what bothered me most about this story.No, what ENRAGED me is what happened next.The very next day, a new Land Rover was ostentatiously delivered to Philip in full view of the media.And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act.The pictures showed a defiant Philip snarling at the wheel.His message was clear: ‘You won’t stop me driving, I’m rich enough to get a new car whenever I like, and I don’t care about obeying the law of the land.’          Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist. Her nine-month-old baby was in the back seat And frankly, he made me sick to my stomach.What astonishing arrogance!And how staggeringly insensitive to the people whose car he smashed into only hours earlier!Just imagine the outrage that would have erupted if a famous footballer like David Beckham had behaved like this?He’d have rightly been crucified both in the press, and in the court of public opinion.He’d have also faced almost certain prosecution.Yet Philip, we’re told, has been given just a friendly warning by police.To make matters worse, he hasn’t even bothered to contact the people he hit. Instead, an aide for his wife, the Queen, left a voicemail message saying they were ‘thinking of you very much’.Really?It doesn’t seem to me that Philip has been thinking of anyone but himself, in the most selfish, aloof and inconsiderate possible manner.I’m a big fan of the royals I think they do a huge amount of good for Britain, and our image around the world, that fully justifies – and repays - the vast amount of tax-payer money we spend on them.I also think, notwithstanding his extreme aversion to media people like me, that Prince Philip is an extraordinary man who has devoted most of his life to serving his country superbly well in myriad ways.He certainly fully deserves his recent long-overdue retirement from public life.But he needs to understand this incident has shown him at his privileged worst, and reflects badly on all the royals.The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt.To be so openly, flagrantly contemptuous of public opinion, members of the public, and the law of the land is completely unacceptable – especially if you’re the husband of the Queen.Where is his contrition, or common courtesy?    The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt Philip, as I know to my cost, won’t care what I have to say about his conduct.And he won’t care what the rest of the media thinks either.Nor, it is sadly obvious, does he seem to care about the on-going condition and feelings of the people he careered into.It’s equally apparent he is refusing to listen to a word any of his protection officers are saying to him – because they would have surely begged him not to go back out driving on his own on public roads so soon after an accident, without even belting up.No, there’s only one person in the world who Philip ever listens to and that’s his wife.So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.For his sake, and ours.          So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.

Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old babyHer friend, the driver, suffered minor injuries, and the baby, thankfully was unhurt.Philip, miraculously given he is 97 years old and his Land Rover rolled over onto its side, was also unhurt.He has reportedly blamed bright sunshine for temporarily blinding him, so he was unable to see the Kia coming when he pulled out into its path.Other witnesses have suggested it was a cloudy day, and the more likely explanation is his old age impaired his ability to drive.Frankly, I don’t believe ANY 97-year-old should be allowed to drive a car – especially if they have a whole array of servants and bodyguards who can do it for them.But that’s not what bothered me most about this story.No, what ENRAGED me is what happened next.The very next day, a new Land Rover was ostentatiously delivered to Philip in full view of the media.And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act.The pictures showed a defiant Philip snarling at the wheel.His message was clear: ‘You won’t stop me driving, I’m rich enough to get a new car whenever I like, and I don’t care about obeying the law of the land.’          Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist. Her nine-month-old baby was in the back seat And frankly, he made me sick to my stomach.What astonishing arrogance!And how staggeringly insensitive to the people whose car he smashed into only hours earlier!Just imagine the outrage that would have erupted if a famous footballer like David Beckham had behaved like this?He’d have rightly been crucified both in the press, and in the court of public opinion.He’d have also faced almost certain prosecution.Yet Philip, we’re told, has been given just a friendly warning by police.To make matters worse, he hasn’t even bothered to contact the people he hit. Instead, an aide for his wife, the Queen, left a voicemail message saying they were ‘thinking of you very much’.Really?It doesn’t seem to me that Philip has been thinking of anyone but himself, in the most selfish, aloof and inconsiderate possible manner.I’m a big fan of the royals I think they do a huge amount of good for Britain, and our image around the world, that fully justifies – and repays - the vast amount of tax-payer money we spend on them.I also think, notwithstanding his extreme aversion to media people like me, that Prince Philip is an extraordinary man who has devoted most of his life to serving his country superbly well in myriad ways.He certainly fully deserves his recent long-overdue retirement from public life.But he needs to understand this incident has shown him at his privileged worst, and reflects badly on all the royals.The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt.To be so openly, flagrantly contemptuous of public opinion, members of the public, and the law of the land is completely unacceptable – especially if you’re the husband of the Queen.Where is his contrition, or common courtesy?    The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt Philip, as I know to my cost, won’t care what I have to say about his conduct.And he won’t care what the rest of the media thinks either.Nor, it is sadly obvious, does he seem to care about the on-going condition and feelings of the people he careered into.It’s equally apparent he is refusing to listen to a word any of his protection officers are saying to him – because they would have surely begged him not to go back out driving on his own on public roads so soon after an accident, without even belting up.No, there’s only one person in the world who Philip ever listens to and that’s his wife.So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.For his sake, and ours.

The tip of the little finger on little Opie\u0027s left hand was cut off by the closing door. Doctors have said the finger might now be shorter than it would have been \u0027Doctors have said if it doesn\u0027t heal then he might have a shortened finger for the rest of his life.\u0027He now cups his hands when he walks past the door. When the kitchen door shuts he runs over to it and says bad door\u0027.In a warning to other parents, Karl said: \u0027Thousands of kids get their fingers trapped in doors every year and parents need to be aware if there are mechanisms there that accelerate the closing speed.\u0027The couple said the housing association\u0027s emergency joiner arrived at the property within 90 minutes of Opie\u0027s injury and he removed the concealed hinging. A new door is also set to be installed.In a statement, housing association Accent said: \u0027Firstly, we would like to say how sorry we are to hear about the injury to Mr Nunn\u0027s son.\u0027The health and safety of our residents and their families is of the utmost importance to us and we will continue to work closely with Mr Nunn on this matter. Our thoughts are with Mr Nunn and his son at this time.\u0027The statement went on: \u0027Mr Nunn informed us of concerns with the door.\u0027During a home visit at the beginning of December, we confirmed that the door was fitted at the time the property was built and fully compliant with the building regulations of the time and, as such, would not be subject to retrospective upgrades.\u0027However, because it has been damaged in an unconnected incident and now requires replacement, the new door will therefore automatically conform to current building requirements.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Cat hangs tight owner taken ride MOTORBIKE","story":"The black and white cat holds onto the driver with both paws while on the road in MalaysiaAfter a few seconds the cat turns towards the camera and rearranges its paws, getting ready for the Honda bike to move. Keeping the left paw where it is the cat remains still and doesn\u0027t flinch its tail at all. \u0027We saw parts of the fuselage still riddled with bullets\u0027:...Share this articleThe biker, who is wearing a bright pink t-shirt, then starts his motorbike as the signal turns green and speeds away. The unusual commuter amused people on the road as they had never seen a cat  sitting like a human on a bike before.   Before the pair start to move again, right, the cat repositions one paw, left, on the man\u0027s topThe video was later shared by the commuter on the social media which garnered a number of reactions from across the world. The users found it hilarious as the cat gave a look to the other road users.A user Keyla Arrieta said: \u0027The cat must be like!

What a writer!ChronicExpat is also enjoying a classic, JG Farrell’s The Siege of Krishnapur:Progress is slow as I am frequently distracted by current politics on both sides of the Atlantic...although I’m finding the book quite a good corrective for that. So many of the characters see themselves as riding the cutting edge of progressive (circa 1857) thought, and Farrell so brilliantly inhabits the Victorian mindset, that it leaves me wondering how we with our own certainties will strike future readers (assuming, of course, that there will be a future where readers continue to exist, and that they have any interest in their self-destructive forebears). It also encourages me to remind myself that my own philosophicalpolitical positions may not turn out to be quite so correct as I like to think they are.On the subject of politics, Peter de Bont has found Barbara Tuchman’s The March of Folly “a revelation”:Essential reading for our times. It presents four historical cases of political calamity due to a combination of ideological insularity, wrong premises based on false presumptions, seriously cross-wired communication and inidual shortcomings. She opens with an eye-opening essay on lack of rationality, or even simple common sense, as oft-recurring factor in formulating and executing government policy of potentially sweeping consequence – starting with Troy and the famous Trojan horse, by way of object lesson connecting all the six Renaissance popes systemically ignoring persistent clamour for church reform, ultimately leading to the Reformation George III’s boneheaded inanity bringing England crushing military defeat in the American War of Independence, as well as severe economic loss and, finally America’s self-betrayal in Vietnam.Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 is another “good book to read in these times of collective insanity,” according to ShouldBeEven, who has been intending to read the book for “over twenty years”:I picked up a second copy for three quid from Fopp just before Christmas and it was worth the wait. The final 200 pages are incredible. Yossarian’s Christ-like night walk through Rome stands out in this blackest of comedies.Krestinsky says that Heller’s Something Happens may be “even better”:It’s interesting in a John Cheever kind of way, although even more jaundiced and cynical.Time for some science fiction. A Far has just finished Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky:Fantastic, fun and intelligent science fiction. Themes we’ve seen before but written in a pretty unique way… I discovered it as Tom Hanks recommended it on Twitter. This is my first Hanks recommended read. So far he has an excellent recommendation success rate with me.BullRob has another good one on the go:I’ve just started Cixin Liu’s The Dark Forest having previously read and enjoyed his The Three-Body Problem. Fascinating writing from the leading Chinese author of science fiction.Amazing. Admittedly I’m not the most seasoned reader but I’ve never read anything quite like them. Fantasy that’s new and inventive. None of the tired old tropes. Refreshing to read.Elsewhere, Cardellina has enjoyed The Secret History by Donna Tartt:What a wonderful book. Six hundred plus pages of absolute indulgent pleasure (plot, writing, characters, atmosphere, everything). This time, on the third or fourth go-round, some of the small hairline fractures became clearer for me – for example, in a hypothetical “The Secret History” drinking game I would definitely add a “drink every time a character ‘raises an eyebrow’ to indicate disbelief” rule – but the writing and plotting are so confident and it’s such an entertaining firework of a book, it’s hard to care too much about issues like that.Finally, Devenish is “savouring every word” of WG Sebald’s Austerlitz:All the time there’s the heavy, slightly sinister air. There’s something so perfect about the way he writes, not a single unrequired word or comma out of place.Sebald so perfectly suits the times we live in. Like when I read JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip, there’s a sense of sadness knowing that this is it – this is the last one.We all know that sadness – but at least it also makes the books feel even more like a gift.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Cranes dominated the downtown skyline and homes in the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for Chinese-backed housing projects. Wealthy firms reportedly paid millions to fly in pop stars such as Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj for private concerts.In June British Airways closed the route, the latest sign of a downturn that has rocked the city since the price of oil began to crash in 2014. As inflation spiralled, new governors of the Angolan central bank have tried to rein in the local currency, the kwanza. Now there’s a currency shortage and a disparity in value on the black market, which is driving crime and medicine shortages.Despite this, Luanda continues to expand south and east from the south Atlantic Ocean. The city is home to a population of about 7.8 million, which the UN estimates will double by 2030, giving Luanda megacity status.Luanda is expensive to visit and visas for journalists are hard to come by. Government bureaucracy is obstructive and relentless, and the chance to document ordinary life relatively rare. Angola was once looked to with hope: having shaken off the yoke of colonial Portuguese rule in 1975, could it use its clean slate to put socialist principles into practice? Decades on, inequality is stark: wealth has been hoarded by the elite and the rights of ordinary citizens are trampled on. Many are forcibly evicted to create new developments where they can’t afford to live.In last year’s election, José Eduardo dos Santos, the president for almost four decades, was replaced by João Lourenço, a former defence minister. There appears to be some appetite for reform in parts of the new government: most notably, several lucrative contracts given to Isabel dos Santos, the former president’s daughter and Africa’s richest woman, were annulled by the new president.The modestly titled Epic Sana is a Luanda landmark, one of the city’s top luxury hotels located in the heart of the downtown district. During the oil boom it was teeming with business people oil companies used to block-book dozens of rooms for their employees. The hotel boasts several restaurants with chefs from Portugal sushi appears to be the current fad.Thanks to the economic crisis, the hotel is quieter these days. Some airlines and diamond companies put their staff up there, but the high-rollers have gone.These shanty homes in Zango, in the south of the city, belong to former farmers whose land was taken in 2006 for the housing development in the background. They were given a week’s notice. They have a constitutional right to compensation and rehousing, and were advised to stay close to the new development or risk being forgotten. But communication from officials and developers is poor, and the former residents have no certainty about their fate. Legal battles over rehousing can sometimes take more than a decade. SOS Habitat, a group supported by Christian Aid, works with those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.The Mangais golf resort is also in the city’s south, next to the Cuanza river, and is where rich locals and foreign businessmen spend their weekends. It is a surreal place – lush and green. During my visit, a group of Korean businessmen were playing a round, caddied by young men from the area. There was also a group of wealthy locals playing the women in the group seemed to have dressed up for the occasion.Nearly all of the men I met living at the Aiera Branca shanty village, to the south of the city, were fisherman. The man in the main photo is looking for worms among the plastic trash to use as bait. The men fish the black waters of the lagoon, with their children playing next to them.The child in the final photograph has pneumonia. There is a severe shortage of basic medicine that, years ago, would have been available at clinics. Now they can only be found on the black market and most people can’t afford them. Malaria has also become a huge problem, with infection rates rising alarmingly.Under the country’s constitution, people have the right to running water and electricity. Clearly there’s a disparity between the official promise and the reality, and that gap is where many ordinary Luandans are forced to live.A new housing development in Kilamba, to the south of the city, is one of many neighbourhoods constructed by Chinese developers. Existing homes were razed, with former residents offered spaces in the new buildings. In one development we visited, the rent was four times the average monthly wage. For a while developments like these lay empty, dubbed ghost towns. Now, they are beginning to be occupied by skilled professionals working for the government. By local standards, those people are wealthy.The Povoado bar is in the old neighbourhood of Bita, not far from Kilamba. It is the type of place most people earning normal wages can head to on a Friday or Saturday night to unwind without breaking the bank. Kizomba music blares from its speakers – it is the most popular modern Angolan dance music. It became a craze in French-speaking countries and parts of South America.In the city centre there are upmarket nightclubs such as Docks, where the wealthy go. During the boom years, business was good here. But they are feeling the financial squeeze now too.Luanda has a crime problem. It is difficult to get any official statistics, but everyone talks about frequent armed robberies. There are a lot of weapons around, mostly AK-47s left over from the civil war. At the time, they were handed out to people to defend themselves.I went out with a police patrol on a Friday night. They would stop cars, searching for weapons or drugs, or to see if the driver had been drinking. I noticed the police always travelled in groups at night. One man they stopped was a bit affronted and asked why he had been stopped generally though, people seemed to be polite and wary of the police, but not intimidated by them.Ilha do Cabo is the real heart of the city, where everyone goes to relax: rich, poor, homeless. It is mostly a weekend spot, but during the week you might find students having picnics or celebrating a birthday. Further up from where these pictures were taken, there are expensive beachfront bars and restaurants that largely cater to expats. Everything they serve is imported from Europe – apart from the beer.Interview by Aidan Mac GuillFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55ebf0e85b7bbc08228adeb5c4e1c3d4fc024021/0_288_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192ca901a65c9a9df8455916d5f9e902","title":"from snake soup to sorcery the street traders of hong kong in pictures","story":"Many of Hong Kong’s traditional street trades are on the verge of dying out.

Here is his reply“What is the function of the civil service? To help the government implement its policies. But with Brexit – the most important constitutional issue for decades – every cabinet minister has his or her own policy. Without a written constitution and with only norms, traditions and precedents to guide us, this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken.“I was merely a humble vessel into which ministers, the people’s representatives, poured their thoughts and hopes. My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies – no mean task. We were loyal to each government and each prime minister in turn, supporting their manifestos, their hopes and their dreams where practicable, whatever our private opinions.“But since Mr Cameron allowed his cabinet to campaign on both sides of that disastrous referendum, cabinet government has been defenestrated. There is no longer any collective policy. It is every man for himself, as we saw with Michael Gove, who said he was behind his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson and then stabbed him in the back. I have always been careful of people who say they are behind me because that’s where you need to be if you are going to stab them in the back. But none of them dare deliver the coup de grace to Mrs May because that may result in a general election.“‘A dog’s obeyed in office,’ said King Lear. But not, sadly, Mrs May. Without even the extremely limited authority of a dog, she moves slowly and inflexibly sideways, stubborn as a crab. Never backwards, but never forwards. When I worked for prime minister Jim Hacker, I thought his government was scraping the bottom of the barrel. How wrong I was! Now I see that the barrel is bottomless. Mrs May was recently reduced to telling MPs that it is their ‘sacred duty’ to vote for her plan. If so, that would be a Church of England matter. Which plainly it is not.“So the question arises: whom should civil servants serve if their department’s secretary of state is not loyal to the prime minister? With the concept of collective responsibility out of style, is their loyalty to their secretary of state, the prime minister or (if it takes control next week) the House of Commons?“Oliver Robbins, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, chose loyalty to Mrs May by becoming her adviser on Europe. Apparently he has been nicknamed ‘Sir Humphrey’, which is gratifying in that it suggests I am a legend within Whitehall. But – alas! – no one, not even young Olly, is either as charming or as Machiavellian as I.“But here are some thoughts for him to consider. First, the Irish border: there are 300 potential crossing points. If we leave the EU without a customs agreement there will have to be border controls. It would only take one man taking a pot shot at a customs post to bring back soldiers, tanks, barbed wire, helicopters – and worse.The leavers, English nationalists deluded by their own rhetoric, naturally gave little or no thought to Scotland or Ireland when they campaigned, and Karen Bradley, the current secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is such a know-nothing that when she was appointed she did not know that voters in Northern Ireland tend to vote on sectarian lines. Olly should encourage Mrs May to make a free-trade agreement for goods, which would make controls on the Irish border unnecessary. This would solve the biggest obstacle to Brexit. However, this would require some flexibility in Mrs May, a quality not yet revealed.“We are told that parliament will try to take control. I’m not sure how that will help. On the BBC on Saturday morning I heard two parliamentarians (Lord Somebody and Lady Somebody Else) admitting that they couldn’t see a way through the various entrenched positions. We must avoid ‘no deal’, and the only option at this late stage is to achieve a dramatic shift in public opinion. This might be done by exploiting our traditional competitive attitude to the French.“So I would discreetly phone Michel Barnier. He is French, and the Tories resent that we have never got our way with the French since the Battle of Waterloo. The chief of the defence staff once told me that we don’t have an independent nuclear deterrent because of the Russians – we have it because the French have one.“I would ask Barnier to do two things:1. Make it clear that the UK’s departure from the EU would also involve our being excluded from the Uefa League and Cup2. Clarify that we would also be excluded from the Eurovision song contest.“These exclusions would greatly enhance the prospects of the French winning both in future.“Then I would telephone President Macron and ask him to make a speech saying that De Gaulle had been right all along: the British are not to be trusted and should not have been admitted to Europe that the French have been planning for years for us to depart and are delighted that they and the Germans will now be free to run things the way they want.“With luck, this would so provoke the people that they would rise en masse and demand another referendum to stop the French from once more getting the better of us.”• Jonathan Lynn was co-creator and co-writer of Yes Minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dc981106ad569046908624ba8a4897e7139225/182_274_2970_1781/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd0c5fe1093cdcb3291d007a187a02f","title":"irish readers citizens assembly worked brexit","story":"Ireland’s assembly of 99 citizens found consensus on emotive issues – a model readers think could help the Brexit processWhile the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not. The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren’t being preached at or lied to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f9a94847af7d7034bc0402d8eef14922d3e1b7e/0_600_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecafe0b88fa48ab66e912ba2c655a016","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of short","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘short’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘short’.Share your photos of what short means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 23 January at 10am.

The university’s wider aim is to increase its postgraduate intake by 850 students per year by 2023.Oxford says it is “committed to attracting growing numbers of high-quality graduate students to help sustain its success”. But this focus on growing overall numbers doesn’t extend to improving access for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. A new college, without necessary change, will not fix this.While much attention is focussed on Oxbridge’s record on undergraduate admissions, far less attention is paid to who is admitted to its prestigious postgraduate courses, even though the university teaches equal numbers of both. This matters because in today’s competitive labour market, postgraduate education offers a springboard into many different professions, from academia to finance. Thousands of people from low-income backgrounds are missing out on this opportunity.Of the 102 one-year taught master’s Mst and Msc courses on offer at Oxford, there are only 19 courses (with 284 spaces overall) you can afford using the government’s £10,609 postgraduate loan. Oxford is among the most expensive universities to study for a postgraduate degree in the UK. The cheapest course available at Oxford is priced at £7,730. At the highest end, however, you can expect to pay £41,590 for a master of public policy (MPP) or £42,890 for an MSc in financial economics.In 201920, a one-year full-time taught master’s in history will set you back £11,160 at Oxford, and £11,460 at Cambridge. Both are the only universities priced above the £10,609 postgraduate loan provided by the English government. At UCL a similar course costs £10,440 at Durham, £7,750. Can higher-than-average fees be justified by highlighting Oxbridge’s prestige? According to Oxford professor, Anne Trefethen, the university is “fortunate in holding some of the world’s most significant collections. They provide extraordinary opportunities for scholarly enquiry and represent a ‘front door’ to the wealth of knowledge and research.”This is true, but this wealth of knowledge and research should be available to a wider section of society. Even if Oxford were to justify its comparatively hefty fees, it does not excuse the lack of effort made to support British students from low-income backgrounds. There is a serious lack of financial scholarships available to help.There is not a single needs-based postgraduate scholarship at Oxford for British students. Compare this to its US rivals and the offer is hugely disappointing. Harvard, for example, bases financial aid on need, not merit. When asked for a comment, Oxford said that although most scholarships are awarded on academic merit, “work is already taking place to consider graduate widening participation”. At present, there are four DeepMind scholarships for computer science MAs targeted at underrepresented groups as well as some needs-based graduate funding available at the Law Faculty. Between 2016-2017, I completed an MSt in US history at Oxford. Had it not been for the government’s loan, and the price of Oxford’s tuition fees at the time, I could not have studied at such an elite institution, as I was a first-generation university student from a relatively low-income background.At the time, I paid £6,550 in tuition, a £2,933 college fee (used to cover academic facilities), and a college hall charge of £89. This totalled £9,572. With a £10,000 loan from the government, I could just about afford the course, though funding living costs was a stretch.I should mention, my course itself consisted of three hours a week, for eight weeks in the term. If you were lucky like me, you also got the occasional meeting with a tutor to discuss one of the three essays the department assigned for the entire year. At the end of the year, there was one three-hour exam. Compared to my friends studying history at other universities, I had significantly less contact time and felt that less was required of me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d8b45d6f8811ff23e56fc7ade7ca45f17552a9/439_67_2551_1531/master/2551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fb2fcda85ae80cdfae63e9858cd8e36","title":"state education cinderella service tories labour blame","story":"A national education service, like an NHS, should be part of a civilised country’s DNAHere is a little fantasy to mull over as 2019 gets under way. Imagine that someone in power outlined a plan to work with the public, parents, teachers, heads and governors to establish common values for the education system.The architects of the plan would provide extra cash to implement any changes required by this shared endeavour, aimed at securing continuous improvement while reducing inequality, supporting staff and addressing workload issues. Unrealistic?Except this is not a dream. Earlier this month a 10-year plan was published for the National Health Service based on exactly these principles. It received a cautious welcome, though with inevitable and genuine concern about adequate resourcing.What is clear from the glaring contrast between the visions for these two key public sectors is that education is rapidly becoming a Cinderella service. Far from being energised by a long-term strategic vision, it is drifting towards bankruptcy, chronic staff shortages and serious concern about the ability to maintain standards.It would be interesting another time to delve into how we arrived at this point. Why does the health service hold a sacred place in the hearts of the public and politicians, while education does not? It is a critical problem that the invisible double act of Damian Hinds and Angela Rayner (secretary of state and his shadow) appear to be doing little to address. Hinds has a slim excuse in that swathes of his department have been switched to no-deal Brexit planning.What little resource is left at the Department for Education is presumably dealing with the fallout from his predecessors’ reforms. But as far as funding cuts are concerned, the music stopped on his watch. It was only after being pressed by the education select committee last week that Hinds acknowledged similar long-term funding for schools might be a good idea.And I am not sure what Labour’s excuse would be. The party’s leadership on one hand claims the country urgently needs a general election, while on the other, offers few concrete proposals about how it would use power transformatively.Its National Education Service, still in barely skeleton form four years after it was announced, would provide an obvious starting point to compare to the government’s long-term planning for the NHS.But a recent analysis of prime minister’s questions shows that last year Jeremy Corbyn didn’t include a single question about education, confirming suspicions it isn’t a subject that interests him much.Meanwhile, Labour appears, from its website at least, to be launching yet another education consultation in addition to the one it carried out last year. The permanent canvassing of opinion in the name of party democracy has become a fig leaf to avoid making difficult decisions.But if the National Education Service is to match the NHS in the public’s hearts and imaginations, work needs to start now. Hard questions need answering. How to resolve the chaotic part-academy, part-maintained school hybrid and lack of adequate school sponsors caused by Michael Gove’s frantic shake-up? How to mitigate the impact of a competitive high-stakes accountability on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable – the correlation between exclusion and knife crime alone should be a red warning light. Perhaps most pressingly, how to develop high-status vocational education in the light of any post-Brexit needs.Excellent, equitable health and education provision should be in any civilised country’s DNA, the twin pillars of a socially cohesive society at ease with itself. The events of the last few years may cause many of us to doubt whether the UK can now comfortably see itself in that light.But we can aspire to heal the isions that austerity and Brexit have fostered. Any investment in the NHS is welcome, but condemning education to a second-tier priority is shortsighted, cowardly and counterproductive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a73f7ed52c921c374b135731c33ece2b4acb1ac/0_339_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=120919c19f3994818db5caebba9005c2","title":"what can we do right now about climate change","story":"Calamitous weather events and warnings from scientists that the planet is warming faster than previously believed are causing alarm.

The early pacesetters, Leeds now face the true litmus test given they have lost four of their last five games. They have coped admirably with injuries, strengthening their goalkeeping options with Kiko Casilla from Real Madrid, while the next generation have flourished, none more so than Jack Clarke. Until the turn of the year there were no blemishes but Bielsa’s spying revelations have brought with them even greater scrutiny. So far Bielsa and Leeds – a sleeping giant in every sense – have proved a match made in heaven, a glorious cocktail, though the next four gruelling months represent the final hurdle.A surprise package after a painful season of mediocrity, Daniel Farke’s side have proved formidable opponents, a dangerous beast this campaign no team has won more points than the 18 they have from losing positions. Farke believes his youthful squad, teeming with the exuberance of a series of fledgling academy graduates and the elegant Emil Buendía, can thrive without the burden of expectation compared with rivals. This time last year they were worried about the prospect of relegation and already preparing for the departures of prized assets, primarily James Maddison. They boast goals in Teemu Pukki and Jordan Rhodes. They endured a wobble over the festive period and their next two matches – against Sheffield United and Leeds – could be pivotal.Darren Moore is not going to let anyone get carried away at the Hawthorns but it is impossible not to consider them as serious challengers to take the Championship crown in May. Losing Harvey Barnes, the winger who has been recalled by Leicester after an impressive loan spell, is a major blow but Moore, a hungry young coach with a huge affinity with the club, still has a lavish squad at his disposal, one rich in experience and firepower – no team has scored more than the 57 they have struck this season. Matt Phillips is a classy winger and, in Jay Rodriguez and Dwight Gayle, who both have plenty of top-flight experience, they have the most prolific strike-partnership in the ision.Chris Wilder continues to eke out the maximum from his beloved Blades and reiterated in December that they are overachieving even to be in the mix at this stage. “We should be nowhere near,” Wilder said. “And we shouldn’t have been anywhere near it last year either.” The reality is they are, though, within touching distance of the top two before a trip to Carrow Road on Saturday. Perhaps the biggest concern is their strength in depth, with Billy Sharp and David McGoldrick – an astute free transfer – their only regular source of goals. After Ben Woodburn returned to Liverpool having failed to impress, they need the January arrivals Kieran Dowell and Gary Madine, on loan from Everton and Cardiff respectively, to make a splash.They rock a typically Tony Pulis look: a Scrooge-like defensive record, a hefty midfield crunch but a little tame in attack – and their shortcomings at that end of the pitch could come back to haunt them. To make matters worse, they are painfully unconvincing at home only the bottom club, Bolton, have scored fewer than the 14 goals Boro have mustered in front of their own fans, while they have won more points away than at home. Their promotion push has stalled of late, with the mood darkening around the Riverside after rescuing an underwhelming last-gasp draw against Millwall. But, with Pulis at the helm, it would equally come as no surprise if he ended up steering Boro back to the top flight after almost three years away.Frank Lampard, ever since mastering the art of the smash and grab in his maiden game in management at Reading in August, has impressed in the dugout. He has assembled a vibrant team, a hybrid of youngsters and experienced senior heads, including Tom Huddlestone and the ever present Richard Keogh, while Ashley Cole has now joined that list. But the key weapon in their armoury is undoubtedly the Liverpool loanee Harry Wilson, one of the most talented players in the ision. Impressive cup victories over Manchester United and Southampton – albeit on penalties – this season have given Derby, who were relegated from the Premier League in 2008 with a record low tally of 11 points, another taste of top-flight football.That Lee Johnson’s side are even in the conversation is a marker of the remarkable strides they have made since heading into December with one win from five matches. Unbeaten in 11 games – and having won their past five – they are the ision’s form team. The midfield duo Marlon Pack and Josh Brownhill have grown more streetwise, while Johnson has the luxury of a triumvirate of Chelsea loanees in Jay Dasilva, Tomas Kalas and Kasey Palmer – a January signing. No longer “flogging the same players” as Johnson admitted they were at this stage last season, he has rotated with great success. Scavenged for their best players last summer, that City want to add another striker this month suggests they quietly fancy their chances.There are several, largely underachieving clubs that will not give up without a fight. Aston Villa’s chances of making a late dash for promotion hinge on the next couple of weeks, but keeping Tammy Abraham, the leading scorer in the ision with 17 goals, is priceless. Time is equally of the essence for 15th-placed Stoke City, though an impressive win against Leeds will have reignited some optimism over a surge up the table, while Martin O’Neill has been tasked with delivering promotion at Nottingham Forest. Elsewhere, Blackburn Rovers boast a shrewd operator in Tony Mowbray (he won this league with West Brom in 2008) and are on the hunt for successive promotions, while former Premier League teams Hull City and Swansea City will also fancy their chances of gatecrashing the top six. A rejuvenated Hull, in particular, have reasons to be cheerful, having not tasted defeat in the league since November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/955aca3e7307901685cbec3cad298db9420c28a3/0_0_6195_3717/master/6195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a4d0e0d0e0db738bae1ed4bd8a79d2","title":"marc skinner orlando pride nwsl birmingham football","story":"After leaving his beloved Birmingham, the young manager is relishing working with global stars such as Marta and Morgan“I asked the guys if I could just spend a little bit of time in the middle of the pitch to visualise what the players go through.”Standing in front of 25,500 purple seats, the new Orlando Pride manager Marc Skinner paused to drink it all in. It is a world away from Solihull Moors’ 3,050‑capacity Damson Park, where his former club, Birmingham City women, ply their trade.“There’s a famous picture of Andrés Iniesta on the pitch after his last game for Barcelona sitting in the middle of the field and I think he’s just trying to take it in, all the emotions, and think about them and that was what I was trying to do,” says the 35-year-old. “It’s really important for me that we connect with the fans in the stands, give them an identity, I tried to do that at Birmingham, so they feel a part of what we’re doing. This without the Orlando Pride fans is nothing for me.”The decision to leave his hometown club, where he had worked for 13 years, mid-season, was not easy. Birmingham are fourth in the Women’s Super League, the departure of Skinner perhaps a factor in the latest of their four losses that have left them six points off the top as it came after the announcement of his step across the pond. On top of that he has a new baby with his partner, the former England international Laura Bassett.But this was an opportunity he couldn’t turn down. “Everybody in England knows I love Birmingham,” says Skinner. “It’s my home city, and I wouldn’t have left it for anything other than a project like this with such wonderful potential.“It’s mesmerising. Just being here, it’s a different level. I hope it doesn’t effect Birmingham too much, we tried to leave Birmingham in a place where it would be able to be self sufficient and I hope that they show that over the last part of the season. They’ve done so much and there’s a lot of love for them.”The love is mutual. It would have been easy for fans and players to be angry or irritated with their outgoing manager but instead, there is sorrow and well-wishing – something that has surprised Skinner. “I think that’s been the most surreal part. I’m in awe of the outreach and outpouring and lovely comments that people have made. I think that’s testament to Birmingham and the fans, they are genuinely happy for people that progress and, look, hopefully they saw the job that we did at Birmingham and think it’s good.”Orlando Pride turned to Skinner after a disappointing seventh‑place finish in the NWSL led to Tom Sermanni’s departure, and the Englishman believes it is the similarity between the clubs and their ethos that attracted them to him. “There’s such a wonderful vibe around this club. They are like Birmingham, they are family orientated. They have values as a club, it’s not just a cutthroat business and that was really important for me. You have to pick your projects carefully and you have to pick something that fits in with your personality and then I really started to feel what I could bring here.”Pride come with some big names. The six-time world player of the year Marta is on the roster, alongside her compatriot Camila and Alex Morgan.“One thing they all have in common is they all want to win,” explains Skinner, whose arrival means six of the nine head coaches in the league are English. “If they want to win then I have to find out how they work together to bring them towards that common goal and that’s what I’ll make sure that I do.“I’m all about people before players. I’m going to get to know each inidual, I’m going to care for them like I did at Birmingham and once they know that I care for them, once they know that I want success for them, I think it would be a pretty stubborn person that wouldn’t want to buy into that.”Skinner has form. Before his two years as manager in the West Midlands, he spent 10 years as the club’s technical director. “I think that shaped me. I still think players need developing regardless of their stature, regardless of their experience within the game and their age. I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. I’m able to see the skill set they have and improve it. That’s shaped by my time developing players.”He may have arrived during an international break, but Skinner has already started working. “What I do is I send everyone a questionnaire. I want to get to know them before I meet them and then every player will have a one-to-one meeting before we come back to preseason. I’ve already started the groundwork. There’s nothing like standing in front of them and coaching but I’ll get to know them as best I can so I understand what makes them tick.”That is the most important thing for Skinner. “When they are not feeling well who they would turn to? I need to know all the important people in their lives, the things they value. There are a lot of people that look up to these players but who looks after them? We forget about that, we look about them as commodities and not the people they are. Once we can get that right we’ll be OK.”• The 28-game unbeaten run of the US women’s national team came to a grinding halt as the World Cup holders were defeated 3-1 by France. Two goals from Paris Saint-Germain’s Kadidiatou Diani gave the hosts of this summer’s World Cup the lead. The 20-year-old Marie‑Antoinette Katoto grabbed their third before Mallory Pugh pulled one back for the visitors in injury time.• The No 2 pick in the NWSL college draft, Hailie Mace, scored on her debut in the Australian W-League. Having been drafted by Sky Blue, where the poor conditions of player facilities were exposed last season, Mace decided to join Melbourne City to avoid joining the New Jersey side. It took just 12 minutes after coming off the bench for Mace to score in her new side’s 4-0 victory against Newcastle Jets.• Liverpool have completed the signing of 21-year-old Jemma Purfield. Purfield has graduated from Arizona State University and opted for a move to the WSL. The attacking full back, who can also play on the wing, has played for England youth teams.• The manager of the Australia women’s national team, Alen Stajcic, has been sacked by the Australian football federation after two confidential player surveys found an “unsatisfactory” team environment. The FFA chief, David Gallop, said: “We no longer have confidence Alen is the right person to lead the team and staff.” Stajcic had been in charge since 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"how a 57 hour donkey kong twitch stream struck a blow against gamergate","story":"Harry Brewis raised $340,000 for a UK trans group and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared in a Twitch stream that was an antidote to the worst of gaming cultureOne of the defining features of politics in the 21st century has been the way online cultural phenomena can cross over into the “real” world.Unfortunately, perhaps because the internet seems to bring out the worst in people, those phenomena have largely been, well, awful.The defining example is Gamergate: the 2014 campaign of online misogynist harassment that acted as a breeding ground for many of the figures who would go on to enjoy varying degrees of prominence in the alt-right: Milo Yiannopoulos, Mike Cernovich, Ben Shapiro and various others who saw an opportunity to gain real-world popularity. Steve Bannon, whose website Breitbart became the de facto house journal of Gamergate, made it all the way to the White House. When the history of this era is written – if there’s anyone around to write it – future generations will marvel at the fact that the canary in the coalmine for the rise of the far right was a bunch of gamers angry at not getting laid.If you have not heard of Brewis until now, you’re not alone. Until last weekend he was best known for his YouTube channel, which aims to provided well-sourced and reasoned responses to the arguments of the far right. (His most popular videos include “measured responses” to flat earthers, pick-up artists, advocates of the theory that soy makes men feminine and a truly absurd Swedish far-right type who goes by the name “The Golden One”.) As such, he’s part of a small but burgeoning population of online personalities whose politics serve as an antidote to the far-right views that have dominated online politics in recent years.As the hours ticked by, the stream took on a life of its own. Twitch is, in essence, a site that exists for the basic purpose of allowing people to broadcast the gameplay live as they play video games. Just like everywhere else on the internet, it can be home to terrible people. But it can also be more than that. As Ars Technica’s gaming writer Kyle Orland points out: “These days, Twitch is just as often a place where watching video games serves as a convenient excuse to gather with like-minded streamers and viewers in the closest thing we have to a live digital town square.”Brewis recognised this potential, and exploited it magnificently. Brewis’s initial funding goal (a modest $US500) was quickly blown out of the water and, by the time he finally turned off his PC emulator – some 57 hours and 48 minutes after turning it on – he had raised US$340,000.Obviously, the amount of money raised is wonderful. The manner of its raising, though, also felt significant: game streaming, an activity whose most famous proponent once paid two unfortunate Sri Lankan youths $5 on task-delegation website Fiverr to hold up a sign saying “Death to All Jews”, was suddenly being repurposed as a vehicle to raise money for a trans rights charity.If you have ever sat through a charity telethon – Comic Relief in the UK, the Good Friday Appeal in Australia, the long-running Jerry Lewis Labor Day events in the US – this felt like basically the same thing, except that it was completely DIY and completely online. Instead of IRL celebrities, the celebrity guests who called in were internet famous: Olly from PhilosophyTube! Chuck Tingle! Natalie Wynn of ContraPoints! The donoteat101 guy!But there were also guests whose fame extends beyond the new socialist corner of the internet. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called in briefly, voicing her support for trans rights, lauding the virtues of the Nintendo 64 and duly sending the internet into a frenzy.And then, a few hours later, Chelsea Manning called in to offer tips on how to beat one of the game’s bosses. Real-world personalities such as singer Cher and writer Owen Jones endorsed the campaign on Twitter, while actor Mara Wilson promoted the stream on Twitter and appeared on it.Ocasio-Cortez’s presence makes perfect sense: she’s a politician who is plugged into the way that the internet can both feed, and feed off, real life. Her congressional campaign was driven by the Democratic Socialists of America, an organisation whose growing real-world impact is very much driven by its online presence, and her rise has come in parallel with that of the YouTube left and other extremely online leftist types like the Chapo Trap House gang and the Citations Needed podcast.Some 659,000 people tuned into the stream over the course of its life, and the comment section was a marvel: a feed that flew by at a rate of knots, with comment after comment of support and love, and virtually no-one trolling or MAGA-ing.The following morning, a bedraggled Brewis logged on briefly to Twitch again to reflect on what he had done.“It’s finally properly hit me,” he said. He encouraged anyone wanting to speak to him to “please talk to trans people instead ... this weekend has shown their voices still need to be heard”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f05865b71a8c5b84d69e76665b6c22daf89b43/0_228_3418_2050/master/3418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d6118a51ff95f490643a3636c9e7f4e","title":"hopefuls pay out thousands rupees chase gurkha glory nepal","story":"Training academies – and unscrupulous agents – are cashing in on young men preparing for this month’s feared ‘doko race’ to secure a lucrative British army jobLong before the sun rises above the towering Himalayan peaks that overlook Pokhara in central Nepal, scores of young men gather in the dark on the edge of the town to train for the race of a lifetime.At the starter’s signal, they charge off, first heaving a 25kg sack of sand into a “doko” wicker basket on their backs, and then starting a gruelling 5km race up the steep mountainside. Finish in less than 46 minutes and they have a chance to join the Gurkhas, the legendary brigade of the British army.The Gurkhas’ reputation as a fighting force is almost mythical: brave young men from the hills of Nepal who fight by the motto, “Better to die than to be a coward”.This month hundreds of Nepalese young men aged 18-21 are battling it out at the British Gurkha Camp in Pokhara for just 400 coveted places, in a series of demanding physical and mental tests, which include the feared “doko race”.To make it this far, they have already seen off more than 6,000 young hopefuls who signed up for the regional selection phase in late summer 2018.The prize is not just a job in the British army, but a lucrative salary and pension, and the right to settle in the UK. For young men from one of the poorest countries in Asia, it is like winning the lottery.The British army insists the recruitment process is, “free, fair and transparent”, but with so much riding on selection, Gurkha recruitment has become big business for private training academies across Nepal.It has also become the target of bribery and extortion from unscrupulous dalals, or agents. They approach families of some potential recruits claiming to be able to use contacts at the British camp to secure them a place with the Gurkhas in exchange for a payment of tens of thousands of pounds.Their pitch is a lie – they have no links to the British army and no way to influence decisions in the British camp – but with so much at stake, it is one that desperate parents are susceptible to, especially in a country where corruption is widespread.“There is a real craze for the British army … so it’s common – you can ask anyone applying,” says Om Thapa, who runs a training academy for potential recruits.Ashok Thapa, 19, one of this year’s candidates, says his mother was approached by the son of a retired Gurkha demanding 2 million rupees (£13,500) to secure a place for him in the brigade.Years ago, the British army used to send ex-Gurkhas out into the hills to find potential recruits. Poverty was no bar to selection. Today, recruits are more likely to come from middle or upper-class urban families. The vast majority of the finalists have been to private school and speak fluent English.“The selection process now is completely different. Most of the candidates have achieved top grades. They are more professional and educated now, but in the past they were stronger,” says Rajesh Rai, an owner of Gurkha Fitness training academy.While potential recruits do not have to pay anything to the British army, they are shelling out thousands of pounds to join training academies, which promise to prepare them for recruitment.The number of academies nationwide has increased fivefold in the past 10 years to more than a hundred. Many candidates sign up months before the British army’s first phase of recruitment, and if they make the cut, they stay on at the academies until final selection, meaning the schools are guaranteed a year-round income with no shortage of repeat clients.The standard admission fee is 35,000 rupees for each phase of recruitment, but a candidate who spends a whole year at an academy can easily pay £1,800 in admission and hostel fees. Nepal’s per capita income is less than £800 a year.Rabi Sharma, 20, says he and all his friends have had to borrow money to pay the fees. “I didn’t join an academy in the past because I couldn’t afford it, but this is my last chance so I want to be prepared,” says Sharma, who will be too old to apply next year.Himal Limbu, vice-secretary of the Kathmandu branch of the Nepal Physical Training Association, the body that represents most of the training academies, says: “It’s up to a candidate to decide whether to prepare independently or go to the training centre. That’s a matter of inidual choice. We have been charging a nominal fee. For most of the training centres, the fee is hardly enough to pay for renting space and staff.”The British Gurkhas say they have no connection to any training academies and do not engage with them. “We actively advertise that it is not necessary to attend a training academy in order to successfully pass recruitment selection,” said a spokesperson for the British Gurkhas.The Gurkhas say they discourage people from spending money to get selected. “All the information on our selection assessments … are available on the army website. However, we cannot force people not to go to training academies and ultimately it is their choice,” said the spokesperson.Noah Coburn, a political anthropologist who has researched Gurkha recruitment, believes the British army should take more responsibility. “Numerous young men drop out of school or leave career paths to train for the British army. Once they fail, few actually rejoin school. Many are in pretty serious debt too … the British army ignores these repercussions,” says Coburn.Gurkha Fitness is one of a new crop of academies run by ex-British army soldiers. Co-owner Rajesh Rai says the academy attracted 700 candidates during the first phase of selection, guaranteeing a bumper pay day for his company.Its compound resembles an army camp, with dormitories packed with bunk beds, a canteen and a gym. Eye test charts are pinned to the walls alongside stacks of doko baskets.Kumar Newar, 19, has been at living at the academy for two years. Last time round he failed final selection because of a perforated ear drum. “I felt so bad, I cried … my family has spent a lot of money, about 300,000 rupees (£2,090) in two years.”After an operation to repair his ear, and another year of relentless training, Newar is confident he will win selection this time. “I want to join the Gurkhas for the fame and fortune,” he says.Becoming a Gurkha brings prestige and status, but for most the real motivation is the money.Each morning and evening at Pokhara’s sports ground, groups of potential recruits jog around the rough cinder track or pump out sit-ups to their favourite songs, blaring from their phones.“I want to continue the glorious legacy of the Gurkhas,” says Rabi Sharma, between laps of the track, repeating the standard response his academy has drilled into him, before adding, “and get a good salary and pension, and move to the UK. The salary and pension are the most important.”For potential recruits like Prakash Rana, 20, the cost is a risk worth taking. “If 35,000 rupees can bring 3.5m rupees in the future, then why not?”Some names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c9390b8c52cf8b04898c25179251e900d27e66/0_0_1630_978/master/1630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dacde89720fb4de45c0303e8e0b2f526","title":"seven ways to boost your self esteem","story":"Check negative self-talk, set manageable goals, take regular exercise – and try your hand at gardeningIt’s impossible to get an accurate view of other people, says the clinical psychologist Linda Blair, especially from their online presence. “You’re comparing yourself with a fantasy, and that will lead to either excessive striving or disappointment.” She advises focusing on what you yourself want to accomplish instead. Her other advice is to “get rid of the word ‘should’”. People can put a lot of effort into what they think others want or expect from them, which they may have misjudged – a recipe for unhappiness, she says.Aiming for too-ambitious a goal can be setting yourself up for failure, knocking your self-confidence even if you have taken big steps towards it. A sense of accomplishment is key to maintaining your pride, says Blair, who suggests setting short- to mid-term goals.Although keeping to your comfort zone can offer short-term relief, it can backfire in the long term, says Chris Williams, professor of psychosocial psychiatry at the University of Glasgow. “It teaches you the unhelpful rule that the only way to cope is by avoiding things.” Think of that boost you feel once you tick off a challenge.Low self-esteem can sometimes lead to neglect of physical health. The mental health charity Mind recommends considering any negative impacts on your life of stress, exercise, sleep, diet and drugs and alcohol. Finding ways to relax and addressing any issues you may have with your diet or substances can have a significant effect on your sense of self-worth.Physical activity has been found to positively influence self-esteem and wellbeing. A 2016 study found that physical activity, perceived physical fitness and body image play an important role in self-esteem, and recommended that “regular physical activity should be promoted, in particular among adults reporting lower self-esteem”.Research published in the Journal of Public Health in 2015 found that just one session of gardening in an allotment yielded significant improvements in mood and self-esteem.

Since then she has won the prestigious Funny Women comedy award, created a YouTube series, appeared on ITV2’s Don’t Hate the Playaz and Channel 4’s Celebs Go Dating, and has worked as a presenter on channels such as CBBC.Hughes idly mentioned to the production company that working with her comic hero, Whoopi Goldberg, would be great. “She’s my Beyoncé. She’s the only black female household name in comedy.” A month later Goldberg agreed to take part. “We could have done anything,” says Hughes. “We could have gone to Ibiza or sat in a caravan making sausages. It’s me and Whoopi Goldberg, who wouldn’t want to watch that?”So, what happened? “We took this idea to every channel,” says Hughes. “The feedback from some was that Whoopi Goldberg isn’t relevant enough. Not relevant? She’s a legend!”In response to Hughes’s tweet, comedians including Jenny Eclair, Gina Yashere and Katy Brand shared their frustration at having tried and failed to get similar shows commissioned. As the standup Tiff Stevenson put it, who was trying to put a show together with Meera Syal: “Travel is very different for women, let alone the fact we’ve all come up with differentcool ways of packaging it.”Jody Smith was formerly a commissioning editor at Channel 4 and is now creative director of Studio71, a TV production and talent management company. “The issue is there are fewer high-profile female comedians that broadcasters think will draw an audience to a show,” he says. “The only way to solve this is for channels to back more female comedians early on.”But Hughes believes that commissioners are too heavily influenced by the lack of ersity in the industry to understand why a female travel show might appeal. “The people making the comedy went to university with the people starring in the comedy,” she says. “If you didn’t have any black friends you’d think all we did was kill each other or make grime records,” she adds, laughing. “And I don’t tick that urban box. I’m from a lower- to middle-class family. I just happen to be a British black girl.“I don’t want to sound ungrateful,” she says. “I’ve had a great career and I’m actually making loads of other shows with the very channels that rejected the show with me and Whoopi. It’s not an attack, but a comment on the state of comedy right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35742f870566bb320d7cd178606b435b86761ad/0_851_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2a85149d492bce6424df039d393eb4c","title":"rio ferdinand drink 10 pints vodka interview","story":"Since retiring, the former England footballer has campaigned against Brexit and knife crime, and made a moving documentary about the death of his wife. Now he has embarked on a health business – but is it credible?Rio Ferdinand has experienced terrible loss in recent years. In 2015, his wife and the mother of his three children, Rebecca Ellison, died of cancer aged 34. Then in 2017 his mother, Janice St Fort, died from cancer too, aged 58. Now, he says, he is doing anything he can to ensure he and his children are not prematurely bereaved again.So perhaps it is not surprising to find the former footballer promoting a DNA kit that claims to pinpoint the personalised exercise and nutrition needed for a longer life. Ferdinand is 40 now, and looks even stronger than he did when he was one of the best defenders in the world, an imposing, beautifully balanced ball-playing centre back who won 81 England caps and six Premier League titles with Manchester United. He is certainly bigger – 16kg (2st 7lb) heavier, a brick wall of a man, with arms like surfboards.He may have been a supremely fit athlete, but now he says that throughout his playing career he was so skinny, he often felt weak. “You could see the fibres in my body when I was walking about when I played ’cos I was so lean.” The first thing he wanted to do after he quit football was bulk up – not least because he fancied becoming a professional boxer. He was refused a licence last year and gave up on that ambition.There isn’t much that Ferdinand has not tried his hand at since he retired. He made a desperately moving documentary about life after the death of Rebecca, Being Mum and Dad wrote an equally moving book about it with the journalist Decca Aitkenhead started a clothing line became a football pundit campaigned against leaving the EU and knife crime visited schools and prisons.As well as the campaigning side, Ferdinand has always had a touch of the Del Boy about him. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between Rio the crusader and Rio the wheeler-dealer. And today is such an occasion. He is flanked by a member of his sports management team and a publicist representing DNAFit, a nutrigenetics company that has created a simple saliva swab test it claims will transform lives. Nutrigenetics is an emerging – and as yet largely unproven – science that studies the interaction between genes and nutrition, with the hope of preventing disease.We are in a small, claustrophobic office near London Bridge. Ferdinand seems to fill the room by himself. He is long and languid, tanned, with an immaculately strimmed beard. Suddenly, the room is even more crowded, as we are joined by a verbose businessman who speaks faster than anybody I’ve ever met.“This is Avi,” says the publicist. “He’s here to explain all the technical stuff.” It suddenly feels as if I’ve been interview-bombed I have a funny feeling that Avi is going to try to make this all about him.Avrom Lasarow is a 43-year-old entrepreneur. His fulsome Wikipedia entry states that he left South Africa for the UK “where he began his career which ultimately led to a string of multinational companies”. Last April, DNAFit was bought by a Hong Kong-based genetics company, Prenetics, for $10m (£7.8m), and it appointed Lasarow CEO of Prenetics International. But enough of Avi. For now.Ferdinand tells me of the enormous benefits he has reaped since being DNA tested. When he was trying to bulk up, he soon reached a ceiling, he says, and it was only after getting the DNAFit results that he realised he was doing everything wrong. “I wanted to gain weight, gain muscle mass and retain it. But I quickly hit a ceiling. I was knocking my head thinking: what’s going on?”So what did he discover? “I was eating huge carbs and not enough protein and now my diet is much more balanced. Now I’m 101kg (15st 13lb), but comfortable. When I was playing I was 85kg (13st 5lb).” He also started to do more power than endurance work in the gym. I’m no expert, but surely you don’t need a DNA test to tell you a protein boost and lifting weights is an effective means of muscling up?Many scientists believe we simply don’t know enough about nutrigenetics for companies such as DNAFit to deliver on its promises. Prof Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a world leader in personalised nutrition, says: “Although this is an area of research that has potential, it is unclear whether the science is already there and thus far there is no evidence that it works.” But Ferdinand is convinced if he’d had this information when he was playing, he would have had an even more distinguished career. “Trust me, I would have been able to play longer, I would have got 100 caps.”How else has the DNA test helped him?“ Alcohol,” he says. “If you’re doing it in moderation … ” He looks at Lasarow. “What is it, a drink a day?”“A glass of wine a day is good for you,” Lasarow says. “For instance, in Rio’s case he has a certain genome type, so alcohol in moderation increases good cholesterol.”Ferdinand says that while he and his fiance, the former Towie star Kate Wright, like to set a good example to his kids by eating healthily, he has in no way become a food fascist. “I go to a kebab shop on a Friday and I like a pint of Guinness, a whisky or whatever.”How much Guinness can he get through on a good night? He grins. “I used to get through a load when I was younger.” How many pints? “I could probably do eight, nine, 10.” He pauses. “Then I’d move on to the vodkas.” He giggles. “I could go through loads. I could go all day drinking, then wake up and go again when I was younger.”Blimey, you were drinking all that as a professional footballer? He nods. “I always say to people who ask if I have any regrets about playing, I wouldn’t have drunk alcohol.” Did he drink more than most footballers? “No.” He quickly changes his mind. “When I was younger I did. I was a lunatic. When I was at West Ham … elements of my career are a blur. People talk about performances and results at certain times in them games and I just sit and nod my head. I haven’t got a clue what they’re talking about. I don’t remember.”Would he drink on a Friday night? “No, that would be after a game. Saturday or Sunday. It was a different culture. Crazy. The culture I was in at West Ham was a drinking culture. Football and drinks and nightclubs, that’s the way it was. And that’s the way I lived at that time.”When he went to Manchester United, he says, he pretty much stopped drinking during the season. But he would make up for it in the off season. “In the summers I’d drink for two weeks. Bang. Just keep drinking.”He could so easily have destroyed his health and career. Does he look back and think he was lucky? “Yes. I was lucky. I had a natural ability that could get me through that period of my life. But I got to a point where I had to make a decision to be more professional.”Ferdinand’s boozing confessions are certainly a good example of a life lived less healthily, but Lasarow is keen to get back to DNAFit.“Have you ever done preventive testing?” he asks me. I tell him I’m not proud of this, but I’m more of the less-you-know-the-better school. Ferdinand says he used to be the same. What changed him? Simple, he says – the loss of his wife and mother to cancer. “I’ve got a young family who have seen more than enough trauma for anyone’s lifetime, and I want to be best placed to help prevent anything like that happening if I can. I want all the information I can get from the DNA kit for myself so hopefully my kids won’t have to see any more trauma earlier than they should.”DNAFit and Ferdinand began their campaign in Peckham, a deprived district of south-east London where the former footballer grew up on a council estate. “We went into a couple of schools, and all the children said: I’d love my parents to do this.” (You have to be 18 or over to do the test.) I ask Ferdinand if it is affordable, but Lasarow answers on his behalf. “How much do you spend a month at the gym? You might go to the gym and pay your fees for six months but not get the right results because you’re not doing the right things. Of course, there’s a price because it’s a science there’s a commercial aspect. There’s a small price to pay.” How much? “£99.”Ferdinand went to Blackheath Bluecoat, the secondary school attended by Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack at the age of 18. Did he know Lawrence? Yes, he says. He was four years younger than Lawrence, but because he was a big, confident boy he played football with him and his best friend Duwayne Brooks, who was also attacked on that night in Eltham. “It’s mad what happened. When it happened it was like your life just comes to a standstill. I’d always seen knives or people get shot or whatever, but a young boy at school getting stabbed to death … it’s like, fucking hell. When the news came the first question I had was: where was it, where was it? Then we heard it was in Eltham. The first thing all of us were saying was: what the fuck is he doing there, in that area, at that time – it’s a racist area, don’t go there at that time.”When given the chance, Ferdinand talks touchingly and honestly about his past. But even in these moments, Lasarow is keen to intervene. “Simon, sorry to deflect away from that,” he says. “You were saying you’d promise your partner you’d go for a checkup – if you don’t and, God forbid, you fell ill, the burden on her is increased because the associated costs of being ill would have to be taken take care of … ” I’m not sure how to respond, so I don’t.Did Lawrence’s murder give Ferdinand a sense of how precarious life could be? “It made me aware that if you get into a problem it could be a big problem. But I was aware of that already. I was used to seeing violence.”Maybe it was inevitable that Ferdinand would go on to campaign about knife crime, and was vocal about racism in football. (After John Terry allegedly racially abused his football player brother, Anton Ferdinand, on the pitch, Rio stopped talking to Terry, even though they were defensive partners in the England team. Terry was banned for four matches and fined by the FA.) But he says his values, his willingness to speak out, came more from his parents than his experiences. “My mum and dad are really community-driven people.” He still sometimes talks about his mother in the present tense. “That’s probably the reason me and Kate are the way we are with the kids because my mum and dad were doers. They didn’t have to tell me a lot about being part of the fabric of the community and being vocal about things. They did it, and I’ve seen it, and that’s why I am the way I am.”Lasarow jumps in. “The great thing about genetics,” he says, “and what we’re doing is it can impact anybody or anyone, anywhere, Brexit or no Brexit.” I look at him, gobsmacked.“Wow, Avi,” I say, “that is the most random intervention I’ve ever heard.”Even Ferdinand’s agents can’t help laughing at his attempt to steer the conversation back to DNA. Look, I say, we’ve talked loads about DNA, but an interview with Rio also involves talking to Rio about Rio.I ask Ferdinand if he would fancy going into politics. “No.” Why not? “It’s a murky world. I’ve got no faith or trust in politicians so to be one – I’d find it difficult.” Has there ever been a politician he has trusted? “I like Gordon Brown. I’ve met him a few times. There was a sincerity about him I really liked.”“Simon, we’ve got a couple of minutes left,” says his publicist.Ferdinand was part of an England squad known as the golden generation – supremely gifted iniduals who underachieved as a team. How did he feel when he saw a more prosaic England team reach the semi-final of the World Cup last year? “There’s no sour grapes, if that’s what you’re alluding to.” No, I say, I’m just interested that they achieved more with less ability. “It doesn’t matter how good you are. You look at our team, we had probably the best bunch of midfielders in the world at the time – Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Beckham, Hargreaves, Carrick etc – but we didn’t have a manager who could find the formation that could fit them in and get the best out of each and every one of them. We played a very rigid 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1, and that was the most intricate it got after Glenn Hoddle. Then we got beat by teams with not as good players, specially in tournaments. So you’ve got to be coached right, and the players have got to believe in what they’re being coached, which this group of players do.”“We helped the Egyptian team to get to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years,” Lasarow says proudly. “I’m not saying genetics is everything, it certainly isn’t … ” Egypt lost all three games they played at the 2018 World Cup.In the past, Ferdinand has said that as a player he prided himself on his iciness. Does he think he has changed since retiring? “I’m still quite an intense person but I’m a lot more open. I had the blinkers on. I didn’t see a lot of things emotionally to do with relationships, with friends or family.” I tell him how refreshing it was to see him weeping openly about Rebecca in the documentary and talking about panic attacks – a good example to all the boys and men who suppress their feelings. “Yes, that’s a big thing that came out of it. Everyone’s had a mental health problem in some shape or form, it’s just identifying it and then hitting it head on and meeting it, but again, it’s a cultural shift.”I ask Ferdinand what he thinks of himself as now, primarily – a football pundit, entrepreneur or campaigner? “I’ve never been anyone who’s wanted to be pigeon-holed. So, for instance, when I did ballet, all my mates from the estate took the piss. But I wasn’t fazed by stuff like that. I’ve been comfortable in my own skin since I was young so I never really cared about what anyone had to say. That’s why, as a footballer, I was comfortable creating a digital magazine, getting a restaurant, going into different fields.”You were also one of the few footballers prepared to say what you think. “Well, you’re taught not to, that’s the problem.”Was he pleased that the England international Raheem Sterling recently talked about the racism he has experienced. “Yes, it’s been hard work for him but he’s hitting the right notes, not only on the pitch … ”But Lasarow has had enough of the football talk. “My mission today is to make sure you leave with a DNA test,” he tells me. He turns to Ferdinand. “I think you want to wrap up now, don’t you?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

Get to know the bustling hive of activity with our insiders’ guide, courtesy of locals Oliver Press and David WilliamsWhether up close or far away, Liverpool is a city with impressive vistas. We’ve got beaches, parks, seafront and rooftops – but it’s not just the views keeping people enjoying the city. A fun-loving spirit, full of character and characters, it’s a city in the midst of a cultural renaissance, exploding with independents who keep us all eating, drinking and dancing.Liverpool is a city of makers and dreamers and it never feels more apparent after visiting the Wild Loaf. As well as supplying half the city with bread, it also has a small shop down an unassuming alley where you can buy fresh bread made that day, alongside its city-famous fresh doughnuts. For food on the go, Bakchich on Bold Street offers the best Lebanese food this side of Beirut.For a fancier dinner, it’s worth checking out Oktopus, which specialises in European small plates and craft beer, with a focus on fresh fish and seafood. Speaking of small plates, Maray and its beloved “disco cauliflower” on Bold Street is practically unmissable. As is Salt House Bacaro’s Italian-style tapas, which includes favourites such as ox-cheek lasagne.For something out of the city, get to Belzan (if you can get a seat, that is), located in the student area of Smithdown Road. It’s a classic neighbourhood bistro slinging out some of the best food in the city. If you’ve got room after, grab a wood-fired pizza from Little Furnace just opposite it. Hafla Hafla, a middle-eastern inspired restaurant, has just opened on Lark Lane. Its halloumi fries are worth travelling for alone. If sitting down and knives and forks aren’t your thing, head to Homebaked Anfield – the co-operative bakery opposite Liverpool FC’s home ground, with a queue down the block most days.All that eating can be thirsty work. If it’s wine you’re looking for, pop into Bunch, Liverpool’s first natural-wine bar. On Berry Street, it specialises in off-the-shelf, small-batch wines you’d struggle to find anywhere else. A small stumble a couple of doors down and you’ll be at Berry \u0026amp Rye, the city’s premiere speakeasy – a blacked-out joint with no sign, which can be missed in the blink of an eye. If you find the door, walk in for the bluesy prohibition-era atmosphere and a whisky collection impressive by just about anyone’s standards.In a time where pubs are closing so frequently, many of the local boozers that are surviving have started doing things a bit differently. The Caledonia, a pub in the Georgian Quarter with a great history, has set up its own community library and recently switched up its menu to be completely vegan. It has been attracting students and hungry hipsters ever since. Just around the corner is Peter Kavanagh’s, a pub full of curios and characters that is also definitely worth a visit. For something grander, head to the Philharmonic Dining Rooms, a beautifully ornate – and gigantic – boozer that is very popular for pre-theatre drinks.Meanwhile, the Merchant on Slater Street, with its Scandi-cool decor, is a great place to dance with an Aperol spritz in hand. For a night of sophisticated tunes and drinks, head to Frederiks on Hope Street – one of Liverpool’s top jazz bars – or Kazimier Garden, a beautiful urban oasis where you can catch an eclectic programme of live music and imbibe from a list of great craft beers.If alcohol isn’t your thing, 92 Degrees Coffee will provide your caffeine fix they roast the coffee beans themselves so you’ll smell it before you see it. For tea, don’t miss Leaf on Bold Street, one of Liverpool’s most popular independents specialising in loose-leaf tea.If you’re hoping to take a bit of the real Liverpool home with you, you could do worse than to pay a visit to Matta’s, again on Bold Street – a family-run business for more than 30 years and the city’s premiere shop for international, vegan and healthy foods. In other words, Matta’s is a Liverpool institution. Vinyl heads, make sure you check out Probe Records and Dig Vinyl. For clothes, Resurrection on Bold Street has some great bargains and Outsiders will provide you with all the latest streetwear. If you dream about pastry, visit Artisane on Bold Street for Parisian-style baked goods or pop into the family-run Rough Handmade at the Albert Dock for their famous pillowy pita breads. If you fancy something off the beaten track, stroll on down to Queen Avenue, known as Liverpool’s Diagon Alley among the locals, with its cobbled paving and olde worlde shop facades. Pop in and see wine merchant Devin Stewart at R\u0026ampH Fine Wines for a bottle of something special.Liverpool was once famously described as the kind of city where people go out on a Monday night and couldn’t care less about the Tuesday morning. Never does that feel more apparent than at Camp and Furnace, where the phenomenon began. Thursdays are the new Friday, well at least according to the twins behind Shit Indie Disco, a weekly club night helping revellers relive the golden era of indie. If you’re more into your electro and techno nights, check out Abandon Silence. Constellations in Baltic Triangle and Invisible Wind Factory in the North Docks are also very well known for their wide range of weekly blockbuster events.If you fancy dancing like nobody’s watching, there’s nothing quite like a night at Jenny’s Bar – it’s a disco den with one of the most stunning interiors. The Jacaranda has always been famous for music and all those decades later you can still get a taste of the local music scene.It’s no secret that Liverpool is blessed with some stunning buildings and public spaces, so it’s a damn good thing that it’s also easy to get around the city. The good public transport and bike-rental schemes are loved by the locals, but the city is also highly walkable. And getting the train into the city couldn’t be easier with London Northwestern Railway, which runs plenty of services from Birmingham, London and elsewhere. Plus, there are savings to be had if you book in advance.We may have bias, but the waterfront and the Three Graces are up there with the best when it comes to said buildings and public spaces. At the stunning Sefton Park you’ll find the Palm House – a dome-shaped Victorian palm house with lush flora, and a regular venue for events. Liverpool Cathedral, St George’s Hall and Central library are all musts. For great exhibitions, check out the Museum of Liverpool, Maritime Museum and World Museum. If you get chance and fancy admiring Liverpool from a different angle, Everton Brow offers a view like no other.If you fancy seeing the waterfront from a different angle, climb on board a ferry across the Mersey for picturesque views. For something a bit different, go on a Shiverpool tour, the award-winning ghost tour of the city’s Georgian Quarter. Once you’ve seen the sights, relax at Sugar \u0026amp Dice in the Baltic Triangle – it’s Liverpool’s premiere board-gaming cafe and offers the perfect respite from the modern world.Liverpool’s got loads of amazing art. We’re talking world-class paintings, modern works that make your head spin and street pieces worth seeking out. If you’re by the Three Graces, drop into Open Eye Gallery – a photography gallery with great exhibitions. The Bluecoat is the oldest building still standing in the city centre and houses bookshops, art galleries, plant shops and more. For theatres, check out The Everyman \u0026amp Playhouse, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, Royal Court, Unity theatre or Hope St theatre for something more cutting-edge. The Baltic Triangle is the area in Liverpool everybody’s talking about and it’s become quite famous for the street art, especially the Liver Bird Wings by Paul Curtis. If comedy is your thing, enjoy a good laugh at Hot Water Comedy Club, a place so popular it has two city-centre venues, with local comedians taking to the stage every night of the week.David Williams and Oliver Press are the founders of Independent LiverpoolBook your tickets to Liverpool with London Northwestern Railway with services running to and from London, Birmingham and elsewhere at londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"do not feed the pigeons and nine other unwritten rules about london","story":"London is a world in a city with its own rules and customs, many of them unwritten. This Londoner’s guide will help you avoid some potential clangersThe tubeFor something whose sole aim is to get people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They’re known as flying rats for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it.

Here’s author  Mike Gayle’s guide to the top things to see, eat and drink in the Midlands cityBirmingham may be known as the UK’s “second city”, but when it comes to my home town’s vibrant galleries, cafes, shops and Michelin-starred restaurants, it’s nothing less than first rate. Slap-bang in the middle of the country, it’s perfectly located for an easy weekend getaway. London Northwestern Railway does great off-peak return tickets at around £20-£30 – so you don’t have to book months in advance to get a good deal. And now that you’re here, let me show you some of what my city has to offer. I was born here and, after a spell in the capital, returned when I became a full-time author. It’s now where I live with my wife and daughters, aged 15 and 12. Brum, I promise, has got it all going on. So if you’ve only got 24 hours to spend here, it’s definitely going to be action packed. Here’s a rough itinerary to help you make the most of your day:9.00–10.30Spend the morning getting to know the city centre. It’s an often mocked but nonetheless true fact that Birmingham has more miles of canal than Venice, so why not see some of them for yourself? Sherborne Wharf offers a variety of city centre jaunts. Afterwards, get in a few quick cultural hits with a visit to the new library (stunning views across the city from the sixth floor) and then follow through to Brindley Place to Ikon, an internationally acclaimed contemporary art gallery. Here, you can also find a branch of local indie cafe, Yorks, where you can enjoy a well-earned cuppa and a slice of homemade cake.10.30–12.00If you’re up for a spot of retail therapy, you’ll be spoilt for choice. Head to the Bullring and Grand Central for stores such as Selfridges and John Lewis, or if you’re after something a little more cheap and cheerful, try the Rag market for stalls selling everything from sari material to vintage punk clothing. For those in the mood to splurge, head to the Mailbox for Harvey Nichols, Heal’s and Paul Smith. If shopping isn’t your thing, however, there are plenty of museums to explore, too. The Museum and Art Gallery is free to enter and now the permanent home to the world-famous Staffordshire hoard. If you prefer your museums on the quirky side, try the Coffin Works (an award-winning independent museum dedicated to the production of coffin furniture!), or the Pen Museum, the only institution in the UK devoted to the history of pen making. Peaky Blinders fans should head to the National Trust property, the Back to Backs. Here, in the city’s last surviving court of 19th-century back-to-back houses, you can see firsthand the homes that served as the inspiration for the hit show’s set designer, Grant Montgomery.12.00–13.30After all that exploring, you’ll probably need to refuel. If you’re on the Jewellery Quarter side of the city, head for the chilled vibes of Otto, an authentic pizzeria famous for its Neapolitan-style pizzas. Afterwards, take a stroll across leafy St Paul’s Square, the city’s only Georgian square, to wash down your lunch with the perfect flat white at Saint Kitchen. For veggies, the revamped Warehouse Cafe is a must, or if you’re looking for something more Instagrammable, 1847’s visually stunning, plant-based delights will certainly fit the bill.13.30–15.00If you’re feeling ready for an afternoon nap after all that food, heading down to Digbeth will wake you up. Once known mainly for its coach station, Digbeth is now seen as one of the coolest places to live in the UK. Start in the Custard Factory, a complex of cafes, shops and galleries located within the hallowed walls of the old Bird’s Custard factory. Here, you can catch a cult film at the Mockingbird Cinema, treat yourself to a couple of craft beers from Clink, indulge in a spot of retail therapy (anything from vintage fashion at Cow Vintage to boards and accessories at Ideal Skateboard Supply), and if that’s not enough, how about a game of crazy golf with an urban twist at Ghetto Golf just around the corner?15.00–16.30By now, you might be in the mood for something a little different. Grab a cab and head 20 minutes south of the city to Cannon Hill park. Covering 81 hectares (200 acres), you can take a swan boat out on the lake, enjoy a woodland walk or a ride on the land train. Cannon Hill is also home to Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park. Here, you can see red pandas, European lynx, lemurs, cranes, snakes, lizards and family favourites such as goats, guinea pigs and sheep. And if that’s not enough, Cannon Hill is also the site of the MAC, a space for galleries, cafes, theatre, cinema and concerts.16.30–18.00It might be a good idea to zip back to your accommodation for a quick regroup (andor power nap). While there are tonnes of great places to stay on Airbnb, there are some fantastic independent hotels and apartments, too. Fancy a room with curved walls and some of the best views of the Brum cityscape? Head to Staying Cool at the iconic Rotunda for its one- and two-bedroom serviced apartments. In the mood for a Shoreditch-style boutique hotel? Then Saint Pauls House in the Jewellery Quarter is for you. And for those on a tighter budget, Bloc Hotel Birmingham has some great budget rooms with a designer vibe.18.00–19.30So you’re refreshed (or as refreshed as you’re ever going to be), but you’re not feeling hungry yet and you’ve had enough coffee to keep an elephant awake. A trip to an escape room could be just what you need. Exciting Game Birmingham comes highly recommended on TripAdvisor, as does Escape Reality. Alternatively, how about a trip to Tilt, a cool cafe bar that’s home to a collection of more than 20 working vintage pinball machines? In the mood to try something more physical? Head to Rock Up climbing centre at Broadway Plaza, or Boing Zone, a trampoline park just a short taxi ride away from the city centre.19.30–21.00It’s finally dinner time and you’ll be glad to know there are all manner of culinary treats to choose from. Prefer to stay in the city centre? Look no further than the Digbeth Dining Club, a ticketed street food event that takes place every Friday and Saturday, featuring music, entertainment and a rolling cast of street-food vendors. Alternatively, get yourself over to the cornucopia of delights known as the Balti Triangle. Make a beeline for the Ladypool Road area, where you’ll find mouthwatering and authentic Indian, Bangladeshi and Kashmiri cooking, of which Shababs and Al Frash are particular favourites. Most of the restaurants on this strip are BYOB, so you’ll be able to save a few quid on booze. If curries aren’t your thing, there’s Antep (Turkish), Al-Bader (Lebanese and Moroccan) or Jerk \u0026amp Twist (Caribbean). And if you still have room for pudding, there are plenty of dedicated shops to chose from, Artisan desserts (run by Ali Imdad, former Great British Bake Off contestant) being one of the best.21.00 – 02.00By now, you may be getting your second wind. If so, grab a cab and venture to York Road in Kings Heath, a great location for hip places to drink. Start off at the Juke, a bar that has a neat line of craft ales, as well as a 30-year-old jukebox imported from Chicago. Afterwards, head to organic wine specialist Grace + James and sample the orange wine and imported cheeses. And if you’re still not ready to hit the sack, Hare and Hounds, a Grade II-listed pub, is the perfect place to finish off the night. Along with a good selection of beers and wines, you’ll also find live music and top DJs.For the best value tickets to Birmingham with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5851685dd130764156c9908aacdc0be56a545b9/20_13_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e0a9f84b11147fb78ead79081d6c0e","title":"jacinda ardern asked in bbc interview if she plans to propose to her partner","story":"Eyebrows raised in New Zealand after Victoria Derbyshire questions the prime minister’s feminist credentialsA BBC interview with Jacinda Ardern is raising eyebrows after the New Zealand prime minister was asked whether she has any plans to propose marriage to her partner Clarke Gayford and was questioned over her feminist credentials.Ardern met with UK prime minister Theresa May early this week and is now making her way to Switzerland to attend the world economic forum in Davos.During a wide-ranging interview with the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire, Ardern discussed her hopes for a future trade deal with the UK post-Brexit, the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane, and the changing global world order.Concluding the interview Derbyshire asked Ardern whether she had any plans to propose to her long-term partner Clarke Gayford, who is the father to their child, and a fishing presenter on New Zealand television.The prime minister laughed loudly at the awkward question, seemingly surprised, and then answered: “No I would not ask, no.”“You’re a feminist?” replied Derbyshire. “Oh absolutely, absolutely I am a feminist” said Ardern.“But no, I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself, that’s letting him off the hook, absolutely not.”“Ok, fair enough,” said Derbyshire. “We await that day.”Ardern was also questioned on how she juggles running a country and being a new Mum, and whether she experiences “guilt” regarding the balancing act.Ardern said it was “sometimes a struggle” but it was giving her a valuable and “insightful” experience that was more closely akin to how regular women juggled their work and family responsibilities.New Zealand-based political commentator Bryce Edwards said the question regarding Ardern’s marriage status seemed to take the prime minister by surprise, and it was unusual for her to have her “feminist credentials” questioned.“Such a question is actually very surprising, and the prime minister’s reaction suggested that she was entirely surprised by it,” said Edwards, adding that the episode was reminiscent of a 2017 interview in which Ardern was questioned on whether or not she was planning to start a family.“Certainly a lot of New Zealanders would see such probing of the prime minister about her relationship with her partner and her plans for marriage as being inappropriate.”Some on social media noted that it would be unusual to hear a male prime minister asked a similar question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/798427f2273714f83a5b5edbdc949d0f0e8023a1/0_16_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d70edeb38bc8260b9cd3a4be812fc3b7","title":"two step verification email security mobile","story":"You have frequently advised readers to set up two-step verification to protect the security of their email system.

Its founders explain how they’re standing up to authoritarianismLurking below the hulking concrete cantilevers of Tbilisi’s Dinamo Arena, an Olympic-sized doughnut near the banks of the Mtkvari river, is one of the greatest nightclubs in the world. Find your way through a pitch-black maze of underground stairs and corridors, and you’ll arrive at a 21st-century techno mecca, and a potent symbol of political rupture in post-Soviet Georgia.After starting out as a warehouse party, Bassiani – meaning “one with the bass” – moved into the stadium in 2014 thanks to a chance acquaintance with the director of the national football team. Sharing certain similarities with Berlin techno destination Berghain, the club has two rooms with distinct personalities: there’s Bassiani itself, the vast concrete cavern with its striking spotlights and incredible, pin-sharp sound. Then upstairs is Horoom (the name comes from a traditional dance), a more intimate space and one that is defiantly queer in a country where Orthodox Christian values prevail.In addition to its unique setting and permissive atmosphere, Bassiani has nurtured a cadre of resident DJs – including HVL, Kancheli and NDRX – who have since broken into the European scene. A certain kind of neck-deep, full-pelt techno is prevalent, but there’s no house style on any given night you might hear dirty ghetto house, 80s goth and roughneck breaks. Recent international bookings include Clone Records boss Serge, rising techno talent Anastasia Kristensen and scruffy house herbert Mall Grab. Diversity is a guiding principle, from the music to the iniduals in the crowd. To weed out troublemakers, ticket buyers must submit their Facebook profile for vetting. “I don’t really like the concept of ‘face control’ – it really categorises people – but the reason we’re doing it is the safety of the audience,” explains Gelbakhiani. “We really support LGBTQ people and there are many of them dancing in the club, so we don’t want to see somebody being aggressive. Safety comes first.”Away from the dancefloor, there’s plenty more to explore: the warren of dark rooms that offer a rare space for sexual encounters in a country where many young people live with their parents, and a smoking area where tired clubbers can take a nap or, since last year, smoke a spliff. The decriminalisation of cannabis has been a confusing development in the standoff between Georgia’s young, progressive generation and their conservative elders. In May last year, armed police raided Bassiani and made eight drug-related arrests in response, thousands of clubbers protested outside parliament, sparking a dramatic weekend of counter-demonstrations and riot police intervention.HVL – Elegance Within the ChaosZviad Gelbakhiani: “The very first Bassiani label release from one of the most prominent artists in today’s scene. This track has been played many times as a closing track during the morning – emotional, lucid sound from the club’s very own resident HVL.”“On an ordinary day in our very small office – which used to be in the club – our label A\u0026ampR sent this track for checking out. There was a silence after listening to it. I still remember the moment, and how determined we were to check it out on club’s PA. All of us went straight to the main floor, sat down and listened it to many, many times.”“There’s much to say about Northern Electronics’ Varg and his connection to Bassiani. Once we headed up to Georgia’s beautiful mountain, Kazbegi, after the party – but the road was closed and we were stuck. This track had been recorded at this very strange hotel we stayed at for one night. You can feel the momentum while to listening it. There was absolute emptiness outside of the window, with a mixture of obscure silence and soulless snow.”“This is one of my favourite releases on the Bassiani label that’s not by a resident DJ. The melody and drums make it one of our greatest releases from 2018, and it’s been played many times outside of Tbilisi in different clubs.”“Héctor Oaks’ As We Were Saying was inspired by the raids on the club. There were tough times last May, but this release is kind of a symbol of unity, solidarity and of our victory over the repressive, insulting political classes. Héctor is known for his long sets in Horoom and Bassiani, and this track could be the soundtrack of those marathon closing sets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72af8a5b9458e68d719e1969ddef90ce9655b9ab/521_116_2701_1621/master/2701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=862180ff8beb18a480eb5034b61e3f03","title":"new abba music postponed","story":"A representative for the group says there will be ‘no release before the summer’ of their first new music in 35 yearsAbba fans will have to wait a little longer for the group’s first new music in 35 years, with the release now scheduled for the second half of 2019.In April last year, it was announced that the superstar pop quartet had reconvened in the studio for the first time since their split in 1983, as they prepared a tour in which their music will be performed by virtual reality avatars. “It was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday,” they said in a statement. “An extremely joyful experience!”They recorded two new songs, one of which was due to air in a TV special in December 2018. But the release was pushed back initially to early 2019, with the group’s Benny Andersson saying: “I think we are talking about the beginning of next year now.”A representative for the group has now told Variety there will be “no release before the summer ... Hopefully this fall.”Andersson has recently hinted at legal troubles holding up the release, saying in an interview: “We are still trying to establish the agreement that needs to be done to be able to continue.”Hinting at the sound of the tracks, he has said: “I am very proud of both songs. One is like a pop song from the 70s. The other one is kind of timeless.” He has also said there was the possibility of the group reconvening to record a third song this year.Dates for the avatar tour have not yet been announced, though demand is likely to be high because Abba’s music continues to be hugely popular.

If they are struggling with smaller numbers now, then EU citizens risk becoming the new Windrush,” said Nicolas Hatton, a co-founder of the group.The Home Office launched a third test phase for the registration scheme on Monday. Last month, a series of bugs were exposed in the scheme’s phone app, including complaints that the passport recognition function did not work on all Android devices. The app does not work on iPhones.Alexandrine Kantor, a French citizen who is an engineer at the Atomic Energy Authority, said she had to try 10 times to get the passport chip scanner to work using her Huawei. “And I have one of the latest phones and I am an engineer who is a bit techy. I can’t imagine what it will be like for old people trying to apply. It is not as easy and straightforward as they say,” she said.The Home Office said this latest phase of the scheme was “a test designed to identify bugs before the full rollout” in April.There was a largely positive response to the app on the Google Play store, from where it can be downloaded. “Worked without any problems,” said one commenter. “Scanning and near field communication working well,” said another, referring to the technology used to scan the passport.” “It took me two minutes on my phone from the beginning to the end,” said another.But others reported problems with phone focus, the instructions on the app and a loop. “It keeps sending the same message,” said one. “Terrible – Won’t even take picture of passport. Just wasted 30 minutes for nothing,” said another.More than 31,000 people applied for settled status during the two beta tests and more than 27,000 were successful.Around a third of the 2,776 cases awaiting a decision reported that they were unable to use passport verification process on the phone app and had to submit their ID manually.Hatton said: “You would expect them to have ironed out these technical problems in the beta tests.”The Home Office said it was working with representatives of vulnerable groups, local authorities and experts to make sure less tech-savvy people would be able to register on time.It said it had set up a resolution centre to deal with queries and increased caseworker numbers to 1,500 to help anyone having difficulties with the app.A spokesman said the Home Office was “monitoring applicant feedback very closely, including reviews on the Google Play store” and it was in talks with Apple about getting the app on iPhones.He added that once the scheme was fully open on 30 March, applicants would be able to post their ID document to the Home Office or visit “a local ‘chip check’ service run by a local authority or other provider”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de21ba73f3ff1ab4a1425d8a4dde21196fd43ff/203_0_1569_941/master/1569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f5b0648d5285eca04b7fd5daf6c6ad","title":"labour calls for vote in commons on holding second referendum","story":"Proposed amendment is significant shift in policy towards people’s vote on BrexitLabour has said the Commons should be able to vote on whether to hold a second referendum in an amendment the party submitted on Monday night to Theresa May’s Brexit update.It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll, although the carefully worded compromise amendment did not commit the party’s leadership to backing a referendum if such a vote were to take place.The wording called for May’s government to hold a vote on two options – its alternative Brexit plan and whether to legislate “to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition” that is supported by a majority in the Commons.The intervention came as the party’s leadership seeks to deal with isions between Jeremy Corbyn and some of the leader’s closest allies who are sceptical about a second referendum and those who are more enthusiastic such as Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer.The party’s alternative Brexit plan, which would be the subject of a separate vote if the amendment were carried, proposes that the UK remain in a post-Brexit customs union with the European Union and have a strong relationship with the single market. Citizens’ rights and consumer standards would be harmonised with the EU’s.Corbyn said: “Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no-deal. It is time for Labour’s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.”But second referendum campaigners were last night gearing up to criticise the alternative Brexit plan. The People’s Vote campaign said that it was one of a series of Brexit promises – like no-deal – that were being made with “little regard for what could actually be delivered”.The cross-party group, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, posed five questions that it believes Corbyn’s Brexit model struggles to answer, escalating tensions between campaigners and the party’s leadership.A 16-page evaluation placed Labour’s plan on a par with both the no-deal option supported by hard Brexit Tories and the Norway-plus customs union alternative, in that they were no better than pledges made by the leave campaign at the time of the EU referendum.“All three alternative plans,” the analysis added “share many similarities with the arguments made for Brexit in 2016 when big promises were made with little regard for what could actually be delivered.”It quoted an interview with Corbyn in which he said he would be opposed to any deal that would make the UK poorer, and then cited a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that said “every form of Brexit will damage the UK economy”.The analysis also asked whether the UK would “have any say over its trade policy” under Labour’s policy of remaining in a customs union with some decision-making power over future EU trade agreements.The document, whose authors are not named, said “it is almost inconceivable that the EU would agree” – citing the EU’s Lisbon treaty – and that “being in a customs union without a say would be very damaging” because the UK would be force to liberalise markets to third countries on a non-reciprocal basis.Tensions within Labour have been rising as MPs who support a second referendum want to pressurise Corbyn into supporting another Brexit vote, in line with the party’s policy to explore it as an option if it cannot secure an early election.A total of 71 Labour MPs declared they supported a second referendum last week on the morning of the day the party lost a vote of no confidence in Theresa May’s government, meaning that an early election was unlikely.The group is planning to take the argument further at a news conference on Tuesday, fronted by Labour MPs David Lammy and Bridget Phillipson with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas, the Green party leader in Westminster.Labour backbencher and second referendum supporter David Lammy said the amendment represented “a big step forward” but added that the party’s alternative Brexit proposal “deserves to be properly scrutinised” now that Corbyn wanted it to be centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd5d078d789f8ef86fb01d153fc8be2eb649838e/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6662293a6d6d972308a708e255e4cb2b","title":"brexit secretary eu may not agree to extend article 50","story":"Stephen Barclay warns MPs that supporting an extension to avert no deal is an ‘oversimplification’The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has warned MPs who are seeking an extension of article 50 in order to avoid no deal that the UK may not get European agreement to delay the exit date.Overnight, six amendments to Theresa May’s Brexit plan were tabled by backbenchers, including one by the home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, which would give parliamentary time for a bill that could force ministers to seek an extension of article 50 if there were no deal.On Tuesday morning, Barclay said MPs attempting to force an extension could create difficulties for the government with Brussels. “It is not in the unilateral gift of the UK to extend. There are practical issues,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.He said supporting an extension was “an oversimplification” and that there was concern in Brussels about the prospect of an extension and what it would mean for the European parliament elections.“But also from the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don’t want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against.”The attempt by Cooper, backed by the former Tory minister Nick Boles, is the one most likely to attract frontbench Labour support.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also tabled his party’s own amendment, calling for the government to put in place a process for finding a parliamentary majority for possible Brexit options – including Corbyn’s own policy, which proposes the UK remain in a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, and a “public vote”.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said the amendment did not “in any way” mean the party backed a second referendum. “If it was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specific issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time,” she said.Other amendments also pave the way for possible “indicative votes” on Brexit options, including one by the Brexit select committee chair, Hilary Benn.The former attorney general Dominic Grieve has also put down an amendment signed by seven Conservatives – a sign it could pass if Labour gave its support. His amendment would mean motions by MPs on Brexit options would be given priority in Commons time.Grieve has dropped the more controversial aspect of the amendment when it was first drafted, which had stated that any motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties – including 10 Tory MPs – should be debated as the first item in the Commons on the following day.Another amendment has been tabled by the Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Stella Creasy calling for a citizens’ assembly, and one other from the business select committee chair, Rachel Reeves, on extending article 50.Amendments to the motion are not legally binding but will have serious political effect. The Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison is understood to be in advanced discussions about tabling an amendment time-limiting the backstop, after hearing May tell the Commons that “the length of the backstop was being actively considered”.Should he decide to table an amendment, it may call for a five-year limit as suggested by the Polish foreign minister on Monday. Murrison had attempted to table an amendment to the prime minister’s Brexit deal last week, putting a time-limit on the backstop, but it was not selected by the Speaker, John Bercow.Tory and DUP MPs who had voted down May’s deal hinted on Monday night that some could be won over in the coming weeks. Nadine Dorries, a prominent Tory Brexiter, claimed she and her colleagues were beginning to reconsider, given efforts of other backbenchers to push for a second referendum or a delay to Brexit.“I can feel a growing consensus among a number of MPs, faced with these Europhile kamikaze MPs, who really don’t care about their careers going up in flames, who want to overturn parliamentary tradition in order to stop Brexit,” she told Newsnight.“I think many people are now realising that we would support this deal to get it over the line. Because every day here is a dangerous day at the moment. We may have to see that this is a deal, we will have to swallow our pride, swallow what we would prefer, and vote for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

In its report on today’s unemployment figures, it goes on:Employment increased by 141,000 in the three months to November to 32.5m, the highest since records began in 1971. Unemployment also increased, up by 8,000 to 1.37m, although the total is 68,000 lower than a year ago, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The increase in both unemployment and employment is explained by the UK’s rising population, and fewer people classed as economically inactive, which includes those on long-term sick leave, students, and people who have given up looking for a job. Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister, told the Today programme this morning that the Polish plan for the backstop to be limited to five years did not have general EU support. She explained:We were all taken by surprise when the Polish minister made his statement. We have had cohesion and we wish to continue having cohesion on the EU27 position, so the statement by our Polish colleague came as a surprise, but I don’t believe that it will cause some sort of breakthrough, certainly not because if we start having all kinds of bilateral suggestions it doesn’t lead us anywhere.She also said that she did not think there was time to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement before Brexit. She said:The withdrawal agreement was negotiated along the red lines the British government have put. We respected always these red lines and I don’t believe that things that couldn’t be achieved over the past three years can be achieved now within the context of a few weeks.The BBC’s Norman Smith has got what could be some very bad news for parliamentary journalists.Good morning. MPs will vote a week today on Brexit, and potentially on a whole range of alternative options. You can read the amendments that have already been tabled on the order paper (pdf), starting on page 48.Here is a summary of the overnight and early morning Brexit developments.Up to 40 members of the government will resign next week if Conservative MPs are banned from voting for a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit, No 10 has been told.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has demanded that all Tory MPs are allowed a free vote on plans that would clear the path for extending Article 50 — the mechanism by which Britain leaves the European Union.The amendment is very specifically-worded to allow for the debate of the options. It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way and indeed if it was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specific issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time. We are prioritising seeking a deal which provides many of the assurances we have sought from the PM.There are many in Brussels that are concerned about the prospect of an extension in terms of the interplay with the European parliamentary elections, because you couldn’t pass the legislation in the UK for a referendum ... in the time before the end of May.But also from the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don’t want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against.I have a very simple formula for this, which is if you really support this constitutional nonsense of allowing a backbench group to take over the business and run legislation at the government, if the Labour party agrees to support that they have to think carefully what would happen if they were in power and they did not have a massive majority. This opens the door to mayhem in the Commons and I promise you those who think that the House of Commons could act as a government negotiating a trade deal are living in cloud cuckoo land.He also said allow ministers a free vote on this amendment would be unacceptable.The government has to have a position on something as fundamental as what their plan is for the future. The prime minister was very clear yesterday and there is collective responsibility in cabinet and among ministers - they have agreed there will be no extension of article 50, there will be no revocation of Article 50 and no customs union.Here is the agenda for the day.9am: Sir John Curtice, the psephologist, is among the speakers at a UK in a Changing Europe conference on Brexit and public opinion. It coincides with the publication of a new report on the subject.9.45am: The MPs David Lammy, Caroline Lucas, Jo Swinson and Bridget Phillipson speak at a People’s Vote press conference. They are publishing a report (pdf) arguing there are flaws with alternative Brexit options to a second referendum.

Given that they lack bones, the scientists say the discovery of an ancient hagfish was a surprise.“It’s as rare as finding a fossilised sneeze,” said Prof Phillip Manning, a co-author of the study and chair of natural history at the University of Manchester.Writing in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, the team say analysis of the fossil, including a mapping of chemical elements, reveals a number of features seen in hagfish today – slime glands included.As well as being astonishing in its own right, the fossilised creature – given the name Tethymyxine tapirostrum, or “slimy fish from the Tethys Sea with a long tapering snout” – could lay to rest a row among experts about where hagfish sit on the evolutionary tree of vertebrates.Some believe the form of hagfish suggests similar creatures belong near the base of that tree, with jawless creatures called lampreys, armoured fish, and other vertebrates evolving as time went on. But there is a problem: analysis of DNA from hagfish and lampreys is at odds with this picture, suggesting instead that these species both evolved from an ancient creature that had branched off early on.“For many years the data you got from the DNA didn’t match with what we saw in the fossil record,” Manning told the . Without fresh fossils, the debate raged on. But now, says Manning, the conundrum appears to have been solved.Manning said the branching that gave rise to hagfish and lamprey probably took place place about 500m years ago. But quite what the common ancestor of these creatures and all other vertebrates looked like is still something of a mystery, although the team say it was probably more typically “fish-like”.“This ancestor, X, which exists somewhere, gives rise directly to the hagfish and lampreys but also gives rise to a line of other jawless fish and the true fishes and vertebrates such as us,” said Manning.The hunt for that creature continues. “There is going to be this ancestor lurking either in a museum drawer or still in the ground,” Manning said. “Which is fun. That means there is still work for palaeontologists to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec39f75b5b0799f8862d2a6c39d898d43b287c8e/0_209_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=654eb7630a1c780428091d7cb092e292","title":"nfl officiating nfc championship game rules analysts","story":"Former officials were picking over controversial decisions on Championship Sunday, a sign that things had gone badly awry for the leagueHere is one statistic you won’t find in the official game book from Sunday’s AFC Championship Game: it took 59 minutes in real time to complete the last eight minutes and 39 seconds of the fourth quarter. All the more time for ad breaks selling pickup trucks and building drama with men who have become central to NFL broadcasts, the “rules analysts.”The Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots combined to score 31 points in that , but the game was also stopped four times so critical plays could be reviewed by the replay official. The longest stretch came when play grinded to a halt for seven minutes while officials reviewed New England receiver Justin Edelman’s apparent muffed handling of a punt, which the Chiefs, trailing 17-14 at the time, recovered at the New England 28-yard line.Needing to dissect the play in microscopic detail, but also maybe to fill air time, CBS showed no fewer than 12 replays of that play in those seven minutes, trying to determine if the ball had glanced off Edelman’s gloved thumb, or his shoulder, or maybe even his forearm.Just then Clete Blakeman, the referee, popped onto the TV screen and announced that the ruling on the field was a muff, with Kansas City regaining possession. To the delight of the Arrowhead Stadium crowd, Gehrig Dieter had scooped up the ball after it hit, or did not hit, and ran with it into the end zone, but a muff can’t be advanced, so there would be no touchdown.Summoning Gene Steratore, the former NFL official who is in his first season as CBS’s NFL rules analyst, the play-by-play man Jim Nantz said, “There’s got to be enough visual evidence to overturn it!”“Most definitely, Jim, the point is well-taken,” Steratore said, sounding like he was on a witness stand. “The ruling on the field is that he did touch it. So something must be clear and obvious” to overturn the call. Five commercials followed. Blakeman finally announced that the ball had not touched Edelman. After all that, it was New England’s ball.Because instant replay, reintroduced in 1999, had become such a vital part of officiating a game – a football field covers 57,600 square feet, and seven officials can’t be expected to cover every inch – Fox hired a former official, Mike Pereira, as the first NFL rules analyst in 2010. Pereira’s first tough call involved a game in which he said on the air that an apparent last-minute touchdown catch by Detroit’s Calvin Johnson would be overturned by replay officials, which it was. The referee in that game was none other than Steratore.Each of the three networks that carries NFL games now has a rules analyst. Pereira even has a helper in Dean Blandino, another former official. The rules analyst’s job is to explain succinctly why the refs made the call they did, sometimes softly suggesting that the refs messed up.For the heightened scrutiny they are under, the refs do a pretty good job. Coaches have challenged 10 calls in 10 playoff games this year, and six calls have been upheld after video review. The calls on only six other plays in 10 games have been reversed by the replay official. According to the NFL, replay reversals dropped to 172 in the 2018 regular season from 196 in the 2017 regular season, with challenges falling to 349 to 429 in that , suggesting that coaches might have more confidence that the officials are making the right tough calls.But coaches – like Saints coach Sean Payton, to use a recent example – still think officials miss tough judgment calls. The most consequential play in Sunday’s NFC Championship game, won by the Rams, is memorialized in the game book simply like this: 3-10-LA 13 (1:49) (Shotgun) D.Brees pass incomplete short right to T.Lewis.What was not noted was that Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis was barreled into by Nickell Robey-Coleman of the Rams as Lewis turned to make the catch. It was clearly a defensive pass-interference penalty that would have resulted in a first down with less than two minutes left that could have essentially led to a victory for New Orleans.“That should have been a penalty!” analyst Troy Aikman hollered on Fox. “Sean Payton is justifiably upset!”Pereira was on referee-analysis duty for Fox on Sunday. No penalty was called on a pass that was ruled incomplete, and coaches are not allowed to challenge a judgment call, nor can they be reviewed by a replay official. The Washington Post reported Monday that the NFL is considering adding pass-interference calls subject to replay review.Pereira said he agreed with Aikman, then added, “I know it’s easy in slow-motion. They’re close to bang-bang, but that’s way early enough – even high contact on the receiver. You could have had a foul either way,” either pass interference or illegal contact.Wil Lutz gave the Saints a 23-20 lead with a field goal, but the Rams would have been forced to spend their last time out had New Orleans been awarded a first down, making a game-tying drive substantially more difficult. The Rams tied the game and won in overtime.The Saints-Rams game was not bogged down by either a coach’s challenge or a replay reversal. Pereira had much less to talk about Sunday than Steratore. The fact that these “rules analysts” have become a cottage industry, though, suggests that the NFL has a problem.Referees are people, and even seven of the sharpest people in the business can’t see everything that unfolds on a 1.32-acre football field. Perhaps just scoring plays should be reviewed by a replay official, and the refs can be left to figure everything else out.Or maybe there should be no refs, and everything would be judged on cameras. But that would leave Gene Steratore and Mike Pereira out of a job, and no extra time to sell more beer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98d2f7830963645670629b4916496492d71cba7a/23_22_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17b8ffe10054a8365cfc13a1857af7f","title":"modern rugby unorthodox six nations 2019 stuart barnes","story":"Stuart Barnes’ latest book is a timely reminder before the 2019 Six Nations of how the unexpected can be decisiveThe language of rugby has changed hugely in the past quarter of a century. What used to be a tackle is now a big hit and wingers have wheels or gas as opposed to pace. The term dummy scissors belongs in a museum, along with garryowens and argy-bargy. Naughty feet, game-changers, taking the learnings and going upstairs are rather more commonplace now than sidesteps, replacements, mud-baths or players drinking bottles of red to help them sleep better on the eve of major internationals.It partly explains why Stuart Barnes’s new book, Sketches from Memory, is such a thought-provoking read. As a commentator and pundit, few wrestle with rugby’s modern lexicon on a more regular basis than Barnesy, never one to employ a cliché where a smart literary reference might do instead. The former Bath and England fly-half writes as he once played: dull orthodoxy remains his sworn enemy. His latest tome, typically, is not just any old rugby book. From Bob Dylan to Bath and Shakespeare to Sky, there is something for everyone in its honest, trenchant revealing and, occasionally, poetic pages.With the Six Nations fast approaching, it could be worth today’s players sticking a copy in their kitbags as they prepare for the all-consuming annual frenzy. The game has altered beyond recognition but Barnes is very good on how players – and particularly talented playmakers – think. The fear of failure, the sting of selectorial rejection, the joy of true mateship, the quest for personal fulfilment … all of it will strike a chord with anyone who views playing as something more – to borrow another glib phrase – than just trucking the ball up.Among the stories of great old Bath characters and the misty reminiscences of a sporting life well lived, there are two particularly salient messages. The first is the value of staying true to yourself. In Barnes’s case this was famously illustrated when he was recalled by England to face Scotland at Twickenham in 1993 after a lengthy, partly self-imposed Test exile. Knowing his reputation was on the line he retreated rather nervously to his room at the Petersham Hotel on the Friday evening with a good book, only to be interrupted by a knock on the door. It was his friend and club-mate Jerry Guscott with an aforementioned nice bottle of red. “The hopes matured with the Bordeaux,” remembers Barnes. “What could have been a little sleep ended up a deep one. I woke up as ready as I would ever be.”That Saturday, by his own admission, altered his life forever. England supporters had been crying out for someone, or something, to refresh their jaded palates and Barnes duly provided it, turning a tricky pass from Dewi Morris just outside his 22 into a classic break and slick pass to Guscott that ultimately produced a try for Rory Underwood at the other end. “One jink off the right foot and a decent pass changed my life,” writes Barnes. “I woke up the next day, Prince Hamlet for the only time in an international career of bit-part attendant.”Barely a year later Barnes was a Fleet Street columnist and soon after that he was being snapped up by Sky as their voice of rugby. If his flash of supposedly off-the-cuff skill was not quite as instinctive as it looked, honed as it had been during countless hours of practice on Bath’s training field, it should serve as a timely reminder to today’s players of the importance of seizing the moment – and being prepared to take a risk to do so – whenever it materialises.Long after people have forgotten the score of Scotland’s Calcutta Cup win over England last season, for instance, they will celebrate the spectacular long pass by Finn Russell to Huw Jones that created the match-defining score. How swiftly we have all forgotten how close Ireland came to losing to France in the opening match of last year’s Six Nations, until Johnny Sexton’s remarkable match-winning drop goal pointed them in the direction of grand slam heaven.Twelve months on, Russell is a blossoming talent in Paris with Racing 92 while Sexton is the world player of the year. Had either of them settled for the mundane, the orthodox or the safe haven of their comfort zones, the magic would never have materialised. Of course top-level rugby is about winning but it is also about testing yourself, pushing the boundaries of what the majority think is possible and, in the process, enriching the lives of those lucky enough to be watching.Which leads us to the central thesis of Barnes’s book, specifically his belief that facts are ultimately less crucial to personal fulfilment than feelings. Become too weighed down by the expectations of others or constrained by the law of averages and even the most successful players will feel slightly unfulfilled when they finish. “What I have learned in an obsessive rugby life is that nothing is inevitable,” writes Barnes.Don’t tell him but he is right. Gym strength and GPS data are familiar features of the jargon-heavy modern Six Nations but never underestimate the power of the imagination.Sketches from Memory: A Rugby Memoir by Stuart Barnes will be published on 7 February by Polaris PublishingTalking of stylish fly-halfs, pro rugby has bid farewell to a very good one in the shape of Pat Lambie, the Springbok who has had to retire aged just 28 because of “persistent post-concussion symptoms”. In May 2017, he spent six months out after colliding with a Sharks teammate and in December of the same year, following another concussion sustained playing for Racing 92 against Oyonnax, he experienced symptoms “lasting about 40 days” . Those symptoms, he told L’Équipe, included trembling legs, headaches, migraines and eye irritations.More recently two neurologists finally advised him to stop playing rugby. He is far from the first playmaker to experience such discomfort – Australia’s Berrick Barnes is another wince-inducing case study – while Wales’s diminutive full-back Leigh Halfpenny will sit out the start of this year’s Six Nations after being concussed for the fourth time in six years against Australia last autumn. That incident saw no action taken against the onrushing Australian who collided with Halfpenny, despite rugby’s insistence that player welfare must be paramount. Any professional sport struggling to keep its most skilful players on the field has a real problem on its hands.The Six Nations launch. Every 12 months the respective head coaches and captains congregate in London to tell the media they are planning to take the forthcoming tournament one game at a time. Maybe this will be the year some decide to play a few more shots, with Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt among those who will no longer be in their current roles this time next year. There is also the small matter of who will coach the 2021 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. With many of the leading candidates under the same roof at the Hurlingham Club this week, the jockeying for position is about to start in earnest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/235839d207b04da3a47447e69840ce2561f28d17/0_13_3976_2386/master/3976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2e5523dc2c65af596ba3cde0bae80b","title":"petra kvitova v ashleigh barty australian open quarter finals live","story":"Petra Kvitova proved too strong for the home hope Ashleigh Barty in an impressive 6-1, 6-4 victoryFrom the Press Association:Petra Kvitova ended hopes of a home singles champion at the Australian Open with a crushing victory over Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals.Barty was the first Australian woman to reach the last eight for 10 years and there was optimism she could become the first home winner since Chris O’Neil in 1978, but Kvitova was in devastating form in a 6-1, 6-4 victory. The Czech has not lost more than five games in any of her matches so far and is through to the last four at a slam for the first time since winning her second Wimbledon title in 2014 and a little over two years after fearing she might never play again when she was stabbed in the hand by an intruder at her home. Kvitova’s victory, meanwhile, ensures Simona Halep will be replaced as world No 1, although Naomi Osaka, Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina are also in the frame. Kvitova began her on-court interview by apologising to the deflated crowd, saying: “I’m sorry guys. She’s such a nice person and you should be very proud of her. It was a great match definitely. She came back well, she didn’t give me anything for free and I really had to fight until the end.” The 28-year-old became emotional when asked about the struggles she has been through, choking back tears as she said: “I didn’t really imagine to be back in this great stadium, it’s great.” Kvitova’s comeback has been one of the sport’s more remarkable stories but her failure to back up impressive form on the WTA Tour at the grand slams last year meant she arrived in Melbourne with little fanfare despite winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. In the final a little over a week ago she defeated Barty in a tight tussle decided by a third-set tie-break after the Australian had won the opening set for the loss of only one game. Here it was Kvitova who raced through the opener, her clean power-hitting too much for Barty, who looked to be feeling the weight of expectation upon her shoulders.The 22-year-old dug in at the start of the second set and began to disrupt Kvitova’s rhythm but chances to break came and went in the opening two games and, when the Czech seized her opportunity at 5-4, the end swiftly followed.Here’s the Nadal v Tiafoe liveblog. See you there. Bye!I’ll shortly be switching to a totally new liveblog for the Nadal match. He and Tiafoe have never played before Stefanos Tsitsipas awaits the winner. Here’s Pat Cash’s summary on Eurosport of the Kvitova v Barty match. He pretty much nails it: Kvitova was very close to unplayable today.Full credit to Petra Kvitova – she played unbelievably well. I think Ashleigh Barty threw a whole lot of stuff at her in the second set but once Petra gets going she’s almost unstoppable. She was really going for her shots and they certainly went in today. Everyone in Australia is very proud of Ash and this is a benchmark for her at the Slams – there is definitely more to come.Anyway, on with the tennis. Frances Tiafoe and Rafael Nadal are coming onto the court now for their quarter-final.Kvitova hasn’t dropped a set, and Danielle Collins won’t have seen much today to give her any encouragement ahead of their semi-final.Kvitova was just phenomenal. It’s worth reading this from a year or so ago if you’re not aware of where those tears came from:Barty has had a great run, and there will be more to come from her. But Kvitova was a powerhouse tonight. She hit 25 winners to Barty’s eight, which is the only statistic you need. Here’s what she says:First, I’m sorry guys. I beat Ashleigh. She’s such a nice person and you should be very proud of her. It was a great match. I started better, I served well, I took the first break. In the second she came back, she didn’t give me anything for free and I really had to fight until the end.When Jim Courier brings up the challenges Kvitova has had to face to return to a Slam semi-final, she gets a bit teary:I didn’t really imagine being back on this great stadium and playing with the best. It’s great.She’s asked about Danielle Collins, who she beat in a gruelling three-setter in Brisbane not long ago:I won it, but it was over three hours. Hopefully it will be less than three hours here. She’s very fearless and she’s been very aggressive. I do remember the match from Sydney. I really need to be better this time. It’s a semi-final so, who cares?Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 6-4 Barty At 15-0 Barty comes to the net and for a while the pair exchange shots, Kvitova failing to find the pass and Barty failing to put away a volley, before the Australian dodges out of the way of a ball drive towards her body, which goes on to land long. Kvitova hits an unreturnable serve, but at 30-15 Barty’s mishit loops and spins, lands just in and helps her win the point. 30-30 is a battle but one Kvitova wins, forcing Barty into a desperate defensive backhand that lands midcourt, and we all know what the Czech does with those. Match point, and facing the second serve Barty nets her return and it’s all over!Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 5-4 Barty* Kvitova’s shot-making from midcourt really is phenomenal. When she has a ball to put away, she does so with extreme vengeance. Just as Barty had hinted with her sliced backhand at discovering a method of beating Kvitova, the Czech turns on the power to take back control and in the end Kvitova breaks to 15 and will serve for the match!Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 4-4 Barty At 30-15 Barty plays a lovely rally, won in the end with a backhand of vicious slice and spin. Kvitova keeps it in play, but swiftly loses the point. She wins the next couple, though, despite a time warning.Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 3-4 Barty* Another hold for Barty, wrapped up with an inch-perfect ace that drops on the angle of the T. The two best points in this game both involve Barty drop-shots. The first one Kvitova just reaches, but her attempt to lift the ball over Barty is underpowered and leaves an easy putaway volley. The second Kvitova reaches easily, puts back into play, Barty hits into what looks an empty court only for the Czech to roar across and volley a winner.Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 3-3 Barty At 30-0 Barty attempts a drop-shotlob double-whammy, which is eyecatching but fatally undermined by an overhit lob. Kvitova also holds to love.Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 2-2 Barty Barty comes to the net again, but Kvitova powers the ball down the line and Barty overhits her volley. Then at 15-15 there’s an excellent rally, with Barty repeatedly hitting heavily sliced backhands just over the net. Kvitova wins that, only to giftwrap the following point with a wild forehand. Barty Australian takes it to deuce with perhaps her best shot of the match, a vicious crosscourt backhand return, and wins the next point to earn a chance of a break. Kvitova wins that, and eventually the game, but this set is an entirely different beast to the first.Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 1-2 Barty* Kvitova comes to the net on the back of a strangely tentative approach shot, and Barty punishes her for it. The crowd roars, and again when Barty hits a forehand winner to take the next point. She holds to 15, the game won when Kvitova’s sliced backhand down the line return floats about three feet wide.Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 1-1 Barty Kvitova starts with a double fault, and then goes 15-30 down when a mishit lands well long. She mistimes another shot in the next rally, but this one lands in and she resumes control from there. Barty, though, is not offput, and wins her first break point of the match with an excellent backhand down the line. Whereupon Kvitova comes up with her first ace of the match, follows it with her second ace of the match, and though she has to come through another deuce she holds from there.Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 0-1 Barty* A game of immense important for Barty, who desperately needed a foothold in this match. And she’s got one, holding to 15 and winning the game with her, and the match’s, first ace! First set: Kvitova* 6-1 Barty The first point is won with an absolutely phenomenal backhand, struck crosscourt and landing perfectly in the corner of the court. Barty was running in the other direction and got absolutely nowhere near it, so it would have been a clean winner even if it had been much less precise, but it was perfection. Barty tries to change things up by coming to the net, but doesn’t really have the wing to trouble Kvitova from there, abandons that experiment pretty swiftly, and goes back to being beaten from the baseline. Kvitova wins the first set in double-quick time, and has looked fantastic doing so.First set: Kvitova 5-1 Barty* This is not at all what the whole of Australia were hoping it would be. Kvitova breaks again, to love this time, and will now serve for the set.First set: Kvitova 3-1 Barty* The first point goes thus: Barty serves, pretty well. Kvitova meets it at shoulder height from inside the baseline, and pummels a winner crosscourt. And so it goes. There are two types of point here: the ones Kvitova wins when she nails a phenomenal winner, and the ones she loses when she fails to nail her phenomenal winner. Barty is just hanging in there and hoping for the best, and on this occasion it’s enough to win the game (though an excellent serve down the middle on game point wraps it up).First set: Kvitova* 3-0 Barty This has been a brilliant start from Kvitova, who is smashing winners around the court with terrifying ease. But then at 30-0 she hits a forehand wide and then another long, and follows that with a double fault. Barty finds herself with a break point, having not hit a winner all game. She very nearly wins it as well, but Kvitova saves herself with a fantastic defensive backhand, hit from a couple of feet behind her body, and reasserts herself from there.First set: Kvitova 2-0 Barty* An early break! A lovely crosscourt backhand drop-shot from Kvitova makes it 15-15, and then from a similar position she powers one down the line, another clean winner. She hits a return long to lose the next point, but then another backhand winner sets up break point. Barty deals with that very impressively, with a fine first serve out wide followed by a powerful drive into the empty court, but Kvitova hits another backhand winner to set up another, and Barty having saved that one earns one more with a drop shot. And this one she wins with a vicious return to Barty’s ankles!First set: Kvitova* 1-0 Barty Kvitova won the coin toss, chose to serve, and does so. She’s pretty much straight in the groove, hitting the first serves, and going 30-0 up with an excellent forehand. Barty passes well to make it 30-15 but her foothold in the game does not last long, and Kvitova wins it with an unreturnable serve down the middle.Barty walks out, to wild shrieks of appreciation.Kvitova is introduced to the crowd, and warmly received.Kvitova is backstage on the RLA, and ready for action. Looks like this is about to happen!The whole quite-tennis-to-play-cricket thing makes Barty’s story really unique. Here she is on returning to tennis two years ago:I was very young, but I turn 20 this year and it’s a different perspective on life and tennis in general. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, I can’t really complain. I’ve had a phenomenal career for the short time that I did play. The evening session was due to start at 7pm local8am GMT, but the day session went on a bit late, hence the slight delay. Something should actually happen shortly.Pat Cash is working for Eurosport, who unconventionally are doing without a studio and just chatting in the middle of a crowd outside the Rod Laver Arena. Here’s what he’s got to say about the sense of excitement in Australia for this match:It’s been a long time since we could legitimately get excited about a player and get to a final, but I think she can do it, I really can. But also, her personality – people love her. After the controversy of the men’s players, to see a player like this, it’s just a really great story of someone who is doing great. That’s what you want, a great story.Collins will play the winner of the Kvitova v Barty match in the semi-finals. She has a brief chat on-court:My first time playing on Rod Laver, and I didn’t even practice on here before, so this was quite the experience. All the Australian fans have really made me at home here, it’s just an incredible atmosphere here.And Collins wins! Although Pavlyuchenkova redoubles her efforts in the final minutes to make it a bit of a fight at the end, Collins takes it 2-6, 7-5, 6-1.On the Rod Laver Arena at the moment, Danielle Collins is smashing Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Having lost the first set 2-6, she’s now 5-0 up in the third. Collins is 25, the world No35, and before this tournament had never won a Grand Slam match in five attempts over three years.For the first time in a decade there is an Australian woman in the second week of the singles at the Australian Open. Ashleigh Barty, the 22-year-old from Ipswich, Queensland, is in her first Grand Slam quarter-final, having only once previously made it past the round of 32. She faces Petra Kvitova, veteran of five Grand Slam semi-finals, 10 quarter-finals, winner of two Wimbledon titles, and winner also of the only three previous matches between these two players.These matches have, though, been increasingly close. After a humdrum 6-1, 6-2 Kvitova victory in the 2012 French Open they would not meet again for five years, until Kvitova came through a three-setter at Edgbaston in 2017. Then just over a week ago they played an absolute snorter in the final of the Sydney International, Barty storming through the first set before losing the next two on the slenderest of margins. “One day,” Kvitova said at the end, “you’re going to make it for sure.” Is this going to be that day?This would probably be a good place for a match report from Sydney:And here’s Kevin Mitchell’s take on Barty’s victory over Maria Sharapova in the last round:“I know that I have to go out there and try and be as brave as possible,” Barty said of this match. “If I get my opportunities, they’ll be few and far between so I know I have to take them with both hands and try and really get stuck into her service games.”It’s bold talk. On this stage, under this pressure, with all this attention, in the biggest match of her career, can Barty blossom? She has already proven that she can trouble Kvitova now she only has to beat her. Welcome, one and all. Let’s see how she goes, shall we?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50479e3e4beeb6b85f037773525105321a3776d6/0_151_5014_3009/master/5014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be6c4ac10d2616741389299e18e6adc8","title":"rafael nadal v frances tiafoe australian open quarter final live","story":"First set: Nadal 5-3 Tiafoe* Tiafoe wastes no time between serves. He reaches his mark, bounces the ball twice, and off he goes. He could perhaps do with slowing things down just a little, because this match seems to be happening at wild speed. He tries a couple of drop shots here, and though Nadal reaches both he loses the second point, and with it the game, by trying to blast a backhand winner crosscourt and overhitting, when a little more finesse might have served him better. Not that I’m criticising, obviously.First set: Nadal* 5-2 Tiafoe And another straightforward hold. Nadal has yet to lose a point after landing his first serve, and the one he surrendered with an unforced error at 40-0 was just the second he has lost from six attempts at a second serve. There haven’t been many extended rallies as yet.First set: Nadal 4-2 Tiafoe* Since breaking Tiafoe’s serve Nadal hasn’t won a point on it. He holds to love again.First set: Nadal* 4-1 Tiafoe At 15-15 Tiafoe comes forward to take the second serve early, and keeps going to the net. Nice idea in theory, but the ball whistles back past him before he’s remotely ready. Nadal holds to 15.First set: Nadal 3-1 Tiafoe* So what do you do, when your opponent has blasted you off court in an opening 10-minute salvo of great power and bewildering quality? Start with two unreturnable serves, and keep up the pressure from there. Tiafoe gets on the board by holding to love himself. First set: Nadal* 3-0 Tiafoe Nadal holds to love again. This is vicious. Brutal. Eight minutes played, three games won.First set: Nadal 2-0 Tiafoe* Tiafoe makes his own statement with his first serve of the match, which flies down the middle for an ace. But when given a chance to return Tiafoe’s serve Nadal does so with interest, and after a single deuce he wins his first break point with a barrage of groundstrokes of impeccable depth and power.First set: Nadal* 1-0 Tiafoe A statement of a start from Nadal, who serves two aces and holds to love in the blink of an eye.Right, not a lot of time for chit-chat.

Veteran dancers and newer recruits discuss leaping into the worlds of Dimitris Papaioannou and Alan Lucien ØyenWhen I first saw Pina’s work I was a ballet dancer and I longed to do something like that. Eventually I got an audition with Pina. I’ve been in Wuppertal for 33 years now.Creating Since She felt like going into unknown ground. It’s more than nine years since Pina died. I thought: OK, we’re in the Lichtburg, the rehearsal space where we created all of our pieces. Here we are with a new choreographer, making a new work in her space, but with the same sense of yearning and searching. We knew that the company needed to evolve, and that it can evolve, but I had to take a jump in my heart because I have so much love for Pina’s work and have done it for so many years. I kept an open mind and Dimitris Papaioannou impressed me very much.There’s a circus aspect to Since She and to Pina’s work too: the joy of being alive. I wear a dress that becomes golden through the touch of others. Performing it, I feel an awareness of myself in all humility that I also feel in Pina’s work. I was reminiscing about moments from Kontakthof: there’s a Marlene Dietrich-type expression we have that combines looking far away and far within.Dimitris was very eloquent about what he wanted. His background as a painter and a comic-book maker means he can clearly articulate what each moment should look like. He was very precise, both about how you worked with an object and with each other. If Dimitris had been in the company when Pina was alive and had proposed some of these things during an improvisation, I’m sure Pina would have made us do it. I can imagine that.Dimitris is heavily influenced by renaissance art and Greek culture so he would relate many of the scenes we were doing to paintings or myths. It felt like a very different world to jump into but there are similar tones to Pina’s work. We use a lot of furniture and the way Dimitris used the whole group in formations had a flavour of Pina’s creations. But it was a new way of working and of dealing with ourselves as performers. Many of us are switching between performer and puppeteer in this piece. Before the show we meet on the stage and Dimitris often delivers a little story or gives us a new concept for that night.The hardest job for all of us has been the illusions in the piece. We spent a lot of time in front of mirrors trying to perfect them. Dimitris came to the studio with a lot of objects – sticks, chairs, tables, different fabrics. We spent days picking up these objects and seeing how we could morph them into other things, how they could enhance our own bodies. Quite early on, I put two of these cardboard tubes on my arms and tried to figure out how to walk. Over time I developed a still quite uncomfortable way of walking on them. A lot of the ideas in the piece came from that initial playground but Dimitris fine-tuned them.At some point he came in with these bells: one hangs around my waist, two hang under my genitals and there’s a bell on each leg. More than anything they’re a part of the soundscape. We use other materials on stage to create sounds and enhance the score, which is similar to the eclectic music that Pina often used. One particular piece of music, Aram Khachaturian’s Masquerade, was also used by her in Viktor. That’s been interesting: we all had such a connection to that music from Viktor that it was strange at the beginning to hear it in a different context.When I saw Pina’s Bluebeard it was like nothing I’d seen before. I thought: who are these people on stage? Are they dancers, actors or pantomime artists? I went to audition for the company just to meet this woman. In the audition we learned phrases from her choreography for The Rite of Spring. Pina had such eyes. You felt that she could see every inidual in an audition of more than 100 dancers. She invited my partner Janusz and I to join the company. We thought we’d stay for one year. That was in 1979!I created a lot of new pieces with Pina and loved her process. I didn’t really think it would be possible to go into another creative universe, taking my own baggage with me. But to work with Alan Lucien Øyen was wonderful. Alan is so young but so intelligent.There is a lot of text in the production and the way he created that was very exciting. He would often take the words of two dancers and add something extra: Eddie Martinez and I each had shared some words about our mothers. Alan mixed them and created a new story: it is ours but also not ours.Alan wasn’t afraid of Pina’s shadow. He had respect for her and was always open to hear about our experiences with Pina. He wanted to work in the Lichtburg, which is an old cinema. It was so touching for me to be in Pina’s place but working with a new choreographer – like being in Pina’s universe but going in a new direction. Pina started work there just before I came into the company. The Lichtburg is full of life and creativity and history. It has many different atmospheres and I recognised them in the different rooms of the design for Alan’s production.It is a long show, at three and a half hours, but many of Pina’s creations were also long so it’s not new for us. Alan’s piece has a different energy and rhythm. It’s exhausting because of the concentration involved but it also feels peaceful.Alan gave us space to play around and see what popped up. In the first week we just sat in a circle and talked for eight hours a day. He wanted to know what we were interested in and who we are as people. It’s the first time in my career that I’ve experienced that. It was interesting to see what random things popped up. He would make little notes and take details. We talked about how your perception of time and childhood and memories get distorted about remembering past experiences and seeing how they can transform into something different relationships with family stories you heard as a kid.Sometimes it’s not necessary to go straight to the really heavy, deep, existential questions. The interesting thing about Alan is that he found certain details really fascinating. Maybe it wouldn’t be a monumental event in your life but something very small. He has a childlike fascination – a sense of wonder towards everyday things.The stage design makes you feel like you’re sitting in your childhood bedroom and then it rotates, constantly transforming the stage into different environments. It’s never clear what time period it’s in.Alan admired Pina’s work but never met her. He said that he meets her through the dancers in the company. It’s absolutely the same for me. I never met her but I’ve heard stories from other people. Through the work, and how my colleagues approach the work, I feel like something materialises more and more in my mind, about who Pina was. When I’m alone in the Lichtburg rehearsing something and the lights flicker I feel like I want to talk to her. I can feel her presence in the space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d91cc4206bde9e2f03ea70f7c2c9ca5f62c9536b/175_0_3735_2242/master/3735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036ef25b9849a220640598cdca1446fe","title":"bali wild west coast adventure beaches surf wildlife new flights","story":"Quiet beaches, great surf, jungle to explore and wildlife to watch – and within easier reach on a new non-stop flight from the UK to BaliAdeng adeng is a traditional Balinese mantra meaning “slowly, slowly”. It’s a phrase you don’t often hear these days among the traffic jams and sunbed logjams of Bali’s booming tourism centres. People say that Bali is spoiled and for years the search has been on for a “new Bali”. But the old Bali never really disappeared: it just went west.The nation’s airline, Garuda Indonesia, has perhaps sensed this, as it has a new, direct 15½-hour flight from Heathrow to Bali starting on Tuesday (22 January) – although the return journey goes via Jakarta.I first fell in love with west Bali 16 years ago when, as a backpacking surfer, I was “adopted” for a year by a rice-farming family. I was attracted not only by uncrowded surf but by the mist-shrouded rainforests that descended through clove and cacao plantations to coconut groves that sheltered fleets of colourful fishing boats. Even more than the breathtaking landscapes, it was the wonderfully hospitable locals that lured me back, regularly, until the area became my home five years ago.Few people on the island, even among Bali’s large expat community, ever take the time to visit this area and, since there’s only a relatively small chain of roads circling the inland forest, perhaps they imagine there’s little to see. But Bali’s “wild west” offers unexpected highlights.For a start, there’s one of the world’s most colourful fishing fleets. The little river inlet at Perancak is home to more than 100 huge timber boats. Much more than just a working fleet, the flowing bunting and ornately decorated crows nests lend the appearance of a floating carnival. With their ranks of longtail engines protruding from the gunwales, they could be mistaken for garishly painted Viking longships. You’re unlikely to see a tourist here but, for a small amount, you can often convince a boatman to give you a tour.It is believed that the traditional sport of makepung (buffalo chariot racing) arrived in Bali from the nearby island of Madura. Shortly after dawn on most Sunday mornings you can witness a frantic stampede of charging buffalo (many of them with startlingly pink skin), hauling chariots at speeds of up to 25mph along a rough dirt-track racecourse around the paddies.Then there is west Bali’s forgotten sea temple: Rambut Siwi is among the least known of the island’s coastal temples, which protect the island from evil forces from the sea. The sprawling grounds are peaceful and, unless there’s a ceremony on, invariably deserted – a world away from the bustle of famous sister temples at Uluwatu and Tanah Lot. Take in the views over miles of beach that rarely see a footprint before you descend to the haunting grotto cave at the foot of the cliffs.The western end of Bali is covered by more than 200 square miles of uninhabited jungle, home to endemic ebony leaf monkeys, deer, giant monitor lizards, hornbills, civets and flying foxes. West Bali national park, at the westernmost tip of the island, is the most accessible part of this wilderness and offers wildlife-watching opportunities. The beautiful Bali myna, or Bali starling, was once so endangered there were only believed to be eight left in the wild. Gleaming white with a flash of blue eye-shadow, these birds are not hard to spot in the wild if you know where to look the rarely-visited ranger station at Teluk Brumbun offers a chance to see a sizeable wild flock of these avian dreams.In keeping with the uncrowded theme, west Bali also has its share of deserted beaches. Stretching east and west from the rocky point at Medewi is an incredible 20-mile sweep of beach with not a single sunbed. The black volcanic sand is shaded with arching coconut palms rather than looming hotels and the only people you’ll have to share it with are a few Balinese fishermen. There are surfing stats to admire, too. On a clean day, rides of a third of a mile have been recorded at Medewi. The paddle out to the line-out can be tricky but a deceptively easy takeoff makes this a very rideable left-hand wave for intermediate surfers. Everything comes with a price, of course, and visiting surfers often soon realise that a few drops of blood left on the sharp rocks is the cost of a session here. (Staff at the nearby clinic get more than their share of suturing practice).For those who like longer beneath the waves, there is Menjangan Island (less than two miles long and named after the deer that roam its beaches). This is Bali’s most spectacular ing and snorkelling venue and is the ideal place to escape the over-crowded reefs off the east coast. The steep dropoff here is a great place to watch an entire universe of marine life that frequently includes turtles, rays, eels, sharks, dolphins and, occasionally, whale sharks.You can rent a stand-up paddleboard to skim across the reefs at Pemuteran beach or hire a kayak from The Menjangan eco-resort to explore the mangrove forested inlets of Bali’s north-west coast. The sheltered lagoons and reefs are a delightful contrast to the wave-smashed south and up here you still have a chance to explore the flooded mangrove forests that once covered so much of the coastline.Medewi Surf HomestayOn the beautiful expanse of paddies north of Medewi beach, this is a favourite with surfers on a budget.

YouTube Premium recently launched Adam Pally’s new show Champaign Ill, about a rap entourage forced back to normality after the sudden death of their meal ticket. And now Comedy Central has The Other Two, about a pair of siblings struggling to cope with the fact that their 13-year-old brother has become a Bieber-sized pop sensation.Both shows are terrific. However, The Other Two has the potential to be something very special indeed. After two episodes, I was fully ready to sack off the rest of the day and plough through the entire series, and the fact that my preview credentials didn’t allow for that physically stung.Written by former Saturday Night Live head writers Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, whose departure in 2017 coincided with a noticeable downturn in quality, The Other Two is funny and scathing and touching in equal measure, and just perfectly observed. It’s a show about the ugly ravages of celebrity as observed from the sidelines, and you suspect that this is something the writers know a lot about. Working on a show like SNL, which is essentially an office job routinely interrupted by outsized celebrity egos, seems to have drilled a very specific point of view into them, and this is their chance to let it out.I would even venture further and guess that this is a series about a Bieber analogue because of Kelly and Schneider’s first-hand experience with Bieber himself after all, Bill Hader named him as the worst-behaved host thanks to a 2013 stint under Schneider and Kelly’s watch. Although, that said, this is not a show about the idiocy of precocious heartthrobs.Because The Other Two is too smart for that. In fact, it occasionally goes out of its way to show that the character is just a normal 13-year-old boy trapped in the headlights. Instead, the series goes after his adult supervisors, and it goes after them hard. His manager (Scooter Braun in all but name, played by Ken Marino) is a Colonel Parker-level monster a middle-aged man with badly dyed hair who works his charge to the bone, bandaging up his Adam’s apple and dying his tongue pinker for better market appeal. His mother (a slightly more human Dina Lohan, played by Molly Shannon), is an ugly fame-hogging leech who clearly sees her young son #ChaseDreams as her last chance after the disappointments of her two older two children.Which brings us to the other two of the show’s title. Drew Tarver plays Carey, an actor first seen auditioning for the role of Man At Party Who Smells Fart while Heléne Yorke plays his sister, a directionless former dancer gripped by a sudden desire to follow her passion – seeing 50 penises in the space of a single summer. These are the characters who the series hangs itself on, and they’re beautifully pitched desperate because their brother’s fame has made them hopelessly aware of their own failings, but neutral enough to observe the manic world of celebrity with bemused detachment.Comedy podcast veteran Tarver is the closest thing the series has to a central figure, holding roughly the same role as Jason Bateman in Arrested Development, if Jason Bateman had ever furiously masturbated to pictures of his roommate. Yorke gets a longer leash, allowing her to play bigger, and she very clearly relishes every second of it. My feeling is that she’ll be the breakout star of The Other Two. One scene in the second episode, where her character accidentally has an adult conversation with an 11-year-old girl, is particularly inspired.

And now the time had come for him to execute “a mission” for what is also called MS-13 – the gang which, Jonathan says, “doesn’t just run Colonia 15, they almost run Honduras”.“But,” Jonathan recalls, “I’d rather have a friend than a peso in my pocket, and I refused. Whatever the price, that’s something I wouldn’t do.”The MS-13 death sentence was accordingly switched: Jonathan would die instead.Jonathan lived to tell his story this week in the courtyard of Casa del Migrante (Migrant House) at Ciudad Juárez in northernmost Mexico – cheek-by-jowl with El Paso, Texas. Having fled Honduras, he is determined to escape to the United States. Jonathan is one of 4,000 migrants since November last year, mostly from Central America, to pass through this center – operated by the Catholic diocese, run by two social workers, and volunteers.Jonathan wears an orange jacket and shock of black hair his eyes are obsidian-deep and quick with mischief and wit. He remembers his life back home unhappily, without sentiment: “I started smoking marijuana when I was eight – I can’t tell you I’m proud of my life, or that it’s a good place to be, even before that happened with the Mara. But even if I wanted to go back, I can’t – ever – they’d kill me in the beat of a heart.” Sitting at a concrete table are two boys from Guatemala City with whom Jonathan has teamed up, Osman and Rodrigo, themselves in flight from “poverty and violence” back home. By contrast, this place is sad but clean and organised mothers and children sit beside a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe boys play football – but it’s no more than a way station.All three at our table want to work in construction in the US, but while the Guatemalans left recently, Jonathan’s nightmare is in his adolescent past: he’s now 19, become an artful dodger and survivor of the road, trying to cross the border into America. “I’ve been in Mexico five years now, working, saving, hiding – planning the moment. The Mexicans ordered me deported twice, but I slipped the net. The trains through this country” – La Bestia – “have been my home. They’re more dangerous for women than me getting raped, kidnapped and killed. But now my time has come to cross.”With lines for asylum lengthening, and Donald Trump entrenching his hostility to migration, Jonathan has not entered the system most families here have conjoined, registering for a plastic bracelet and numbered place in the so-called metering line for an asylum hearing. “They’ve made it too difficult, and it takes too long. I’ll go alone, my own way.”Osman and Rodrigo are going illegally too “Trump has made asylum impossible – too long, and you’ll likely get turned back”, says Osman, in English. “I miss it back there my mother calls me every fucking day – it’s torture - but too dangerous to stay and there’s no future in Guatemala. I have to risk it.” Rodrigo, quieter, is more nervous: “I’ve a wife and son back home, that’s who I’m doing this for – but what if I get caught?”Word is out that migrants arriving in Ciudad Juárez stand a statistically negligible chance of asylum through El Paso compared to ports of entry into California from Tijuana where lines are therefore longer, tempting more and more to try Jonathan’s way.But El Paso’s courts are not the only menace. Juárez last year suffered a sudden surge in homicides: 1,247 – a rate of 96 per 100,000. By far the highest toll for any year since the city’s hyper-violence of 2008-2011, during which this was the most murderous metropolis in the world. Juárez now has Mexico’s second highest murder rate after Tijuana, attributed by city security and justice officials to turf wars between gangs for street-sale and cross-border smuggling of drugs.Casa del Migrante lies on the city outskirts towards the perilous Valle de Juárez, entrepôt for narco-traffic and likely route for migrants trying to cross illegally, including these boys.So acute danger faces those heading north, as traffickers hover to prey on and profit from the increased pool of potential custom, and those deported in the opposite direction, as gangs recruit their footsoldiers. The worst massacre in Mexico’s carnage since 2006 was not drug-related, but that of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010, who refused or were unable to pay ‘la cuota’ – the levy. Traffickers are known in the parlance as ‘coyotes’ or ‘polleros’ – their quarry ‘pollos’, chickens.Blanca Ribera is one of two social workers at Casa del Migrante after eight years, she says, “I’ve seen all kinds come through – before mostly Mexicans, but no longer. It’s never been like this – these numbers and so desperate, people who just cannot go back.”Ribera explains that a police presence outside the chain-link fence topped with razor wire is “because of incidents at the center and to keep away polleros. It’s forbidden for migrants go to the fence and talk to polleros. If they do, and seem honest, we’ll explain the risks if they look to be doing business, they must leave. Those expelled, we do not see again.” Whether they make it or not migrant disappearances are oft-reported along the border sometimes people ask at the centre if a vanished person has been seen.But there’s a twist, according to Jonathan and almost all those who plan crossing of their own device. “The police are part of the system. We all know that,” says Jonathan. How part of this? Jonathan laughs again and makes to slice his index finger in half, “Fifty-fifty, that’s how it works. We watch the polleros watching us on the bridges and in the town, and the police allow the polleros to work on their plaza – turf – for a 50-50 cut on the money paid. If you don’t believe that, you’re an idiot. That’s partly why I stay away from them – to be apart from that shit.”Leticia Chavarría is a GP in one of Juárez’ many assembly plants who established a medical advocacy committee during the city’s most violent years and now works with the Bi-national Network for Solidarity with Migrants. “Everyone knows the crossings are managed by the polleros,” she says, “and it’s been understood that for years they’ve operated complicit with the authorities, under an accord never documented or proved. Polleros run stash houses across the city and do business openly, but are only arrested in very isolated cases”.There was no response to a request through his office to interview the mayor of Ciudad Juárez, Armando Carbada, on the policing of migrant security.The border hardens still: just east of downtown Juárez, late winter sun skates across a concrete slope down to the slow trickle of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo on this side), and up the other bank, which is the USA, where Mexican-American workers operate a Volvo digger and trucks to build a brand new stretch of high steel fence. Wall or no wall, this new fortification – which started to the north, separating the satellite barrio of Anapra from New Mexico, under the Obama administration – began late last year under Trump, and continues.And as another caravan forms this week in Honduras, Ribera draws attention to a further, crucial, matter: resources. Circumstances combine against the running of places like Casa del Migrante not just the surge in numbers and entrenched US policy, but accession by Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to a demand from Trump that asylum-seekers must wait in Mexico, not the US, for their cases to be heard.Mexico’s borderland is not yet America’s migrant waiting room, “but as the number of migrants increases, government help is reduced”, says Ribera. At Christmas, the priest who oversees Casa del Migrante, Padre Javier Calvillo, gave a rare press conference during which he lambasted Mexican federal, state and municipal authorities for failing to provide sufficient funds or manpower to help centres like this cope.“The municipality had taken 80 migrants from the bridge directly to Casa del Migrante, without any processing,” says Chavarría, “and Fr Calvillo said he could take no more. The city opened its own shelter, but it lasted a week.”“The truth is,” says Chavarría, “that when most of those going across or being deported were Mexicans, there was more interest. The attitude is that these are Central Americans, not our problem. But it is. What will they do if they cannot enter the United States? Our work, either side of the border, is to educate both migrants and our own citizens on the rights they have.”Back at Casa del Migrante, more people arrive at the heavy gates: families from Guatemala like Eder Ramírez and his daughter, Leti, age eight and two women travelling from Panajachel, with two children each, “running from the gangs”. Had they heard about two other children from their own country who died in US custody just across the river, over Christmas? No. A guard explains the rules: you must surrender your phone at reception and collect it when you leave. No weapons or drugs no Viagra, only one smoking area.Then they register, grateful for a wide smile on the volunteer’s face. Leti wants a soda from the vending machine, but there’s no cash, and they look in a storage closet for donated used clothes that might fit. Leti chooses a pink Loony Tunes hoodie.I tell Jonathan I hope his friend is grateful for what he did – or didn’t do. “He is,” he replies. “He vanished from the Mara’s sight, and is still alive.” How long can you stay here? “Three days.”How long have you been here?“Three days. I cross tomorrow night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7d6dac9ad26c691f2553b47ebcb5e713de46c8/0_293_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e3a0b8829602e7e8c5a7bc7ec47f812","title":"adam moss bids farewell new york magazine","story":"Moss, who is stepping down after 15 years as editor, reflects on the ‘child-like wonder’ of journalism, publishing against the grain and, of course, TrumpIn December 2013 David Carr, the revered media columnist, defined in five words the unmistakable, intimate New York sensibility of one of the city’s cultural behemoths, New York magazine. He called it “lippy, smart and regally provincial”.When Carr’s phrase is read back to the inidual who, more than any other, has honed that voice over the last 15 years, it elicits a lippy chuckle. “Regally provincial, what does that mean?”Well, Adam Moss, if you think you’re so smart, how would you describe the magazine of which you have been editor-in-chief since 2004?He thinks for a while, then says: “Jaded, a little world weary, and yet extremely curious. Skeptical, sometimes cynical yet wildly generous. Funny yet serious. A set of contradictions that somehow adds up to a point of view our readers recognize as their own.”Then he adds, a little wistfully: “That’s how I see it. How it continues to be seen, that’s not something I will be able to control.”Last week Moss, 61, announced that he would be stepping down almost 15 years to the day since he took over the reins of New York. News of his willing handover to a younger generation shot through New York’s media world with a shudder, as jolting in its way as Carr’s death in 2015.It added to the looming sense of the end of an era, that the golden period of New York magazines, the heyday of modern literary journalism in its Manhattan crucible, was now officially over. Coming after the departure of Graydon Carter at Vanity Fair, and the financial struggles of the big powerhouses Hearst and Conde Nast, Moss’s exit felt more like a wake than a new beginning.So is that how he sees it? Is it really the end for the magazine business?“No it isn’t,” he replies emphatically. “The magazine business is doing fine. Speaking for New York alone, our journalism is richer, is better in many ways, we are publishing more of it to more people. This magazine is as strong as it’s ever been. Stronger.”Though he is too old – born in 1957 – to have digital as his first media language, he wholeheartedly embraced its potential from day one, helping New York steer a more successful path into the modern world than many of its rivals.Under Moss, the magazine retains its print edition and has added five digital verticals – Intelligencer (news), the Cut (aimed at women), Vulture (entertainment), Grub Street (food), Strategist (e-shopping) – each of which is growing into a powerhouse of its own within the extended New York family. Between them they reach almost 50 million users a month.Moss made sure to immerse himself in each vertical, taking a three-month “residency” with each in turn to learn the digital craft. “Over time I began to love what digital could do. I began to love the speed of it, the looser, more colloquial and playful voice you could deploy, how you could make it interactive, animate it, apply audio to it, change narrative structure.”Of all the adjectives that can be applied to Moss’s editing style, “playful” is key. In his note to the magazine’s staff explaining his decision to quit on 31 March, he said the best thing about magazines is that they are “more like a kindergarten project than anything else, and that’s what I am saddest about giving up. I’ll miss playing with you all.”Moss says that play, closely aligned with curiosity, is at the core of his editing style. “There is a child-like wonder to the journalism I’ve always loved, long before I was in this business.”Growing up in the sixties and seventies on Long Island, he was awed by the stable of writers assembled by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker when they founded New York in 1968. Among the stars they cultivated were Tom Wolfe, Nora Ephron, Jimmy Breslin and Gloria Steinem. Moss was drawn to what he calls the “boundless playfulness” of the writing and editing, as well as a “kind of confidence which journalism later lost some of. It was a powerful medium, taken very seriously.”Under Moss, New York has continued to pull off the same complex, exhilarating notes – playful, serious, both. One minute he will be publishing a piece on the gynecological perils of emulating the uses of ice cream in Fifty Shades of Grey, the next he will be revealing the prison life of Bernie Madoff or adding rocket fuel to the #MeToo movement with astounding work on Bill Cosby’s accusers.But Moss is not without his apprehensions about the state of modern magazine journalism. As someone who fell in love with narrative storytelling as a teen, he is fearful that some of the energy, some of the confidence of the form has slipped.He stresses that in his view New York has continued to create high-quality story-telling, pointing to the magazine’s success in occupying three of the top 10 positions in the Chartbeat list of the most-engaging articles of 2018 – all for glorious narrative reads. “If there’s one thing I’ve been haranguing my staff about it is that we need to get back to the business of telling stories.”But he is anxious for the industry as a whole about a new cadre of writers emerging with much less grounding in the shoe-leather craft of reporting. “It’s not their fault. Having grown up in a commentary-soaked internet and absent of things like small newspapers where they could get proper training, reporting is not something they do. They don’t pick up the phone or think to go out and find stuff out. That’s frustrating.”His other preoccupation relates to the ceaseless onslaught of social media, and the way it acts as a giant focus group which he fears is sapping the risk-taking energy and creativity of editors and writers by making them hyper-aware of popular reaction. You can see just how worried he is about this by turning to his Twitter feed. Correction. He doesn’t have one.(His successor as editor-in-chief, whose promotion to the top job was also announced last week, David Haskell, 39, does have a Twitter feed but has tweeted only once. So much for the shift to a younger generation. “He’s pretty active on Instagram,” Moss protests hurriedly.)Moss sees it as a real problem that journalists have come to feel dependent on the approval of the Twittersphere. “People are afraid to make enemies. They don’t want to encounter hostility. Some people are very courageous, but I’ve had situations where I’ve asked writers to do a story that make some trouble and they shrug and say they’re not comfortable with it. That’s a danger.”Moss has felt that wind of change blow in his own face in recent years. Though the magazine retains a “great deal of confidence in what we publish, even swagger”, he says, “it is harder to publish against the grain. That’s important to me, because challenging people’s thinking is our fundamental role, it’s what we’re in business to do – intelligently to force people to think. Sometimes that view is not shared by younger journalists who believe journalism should validate a point of view rather than challenge it.”Which brings us, with heavy heart, to Donald Trump. As Moss points out, throughout the entirety of his life in magazines – from Esquire where he cut his teeth as an editor, through the short-lived 7 Days and the New York Times magazine to New York – he has been followed around by one character: Trump.“I’ve lived with him for years. I’ve actually banned him any number of times and said we are not going to publish another word on Donald Trump. And then, frustratingly, I’ve had to row back and start talking about him again.”Trump is splattered disconcertingly around Moss’s office in Lower Manhattan. There’s a blow-up of a 2013 Trump tweet on the wall in which the then Apprentice reality TV star dismissed the magazine as “boring and irrelevant” after it published a photo of him speaking before a half-empty ballroom at a conservative conference.There’s also on Moss’s magazine stand a back-copy of New York dating from September 2015, early on in Trump’s presidential campaign, which has a cover of the candidate mocked up as George Washington. It related to a piece by Frank Rich that argued that by tearing up antiquated norms, Trump was acting as a positive force, with the cover line: “Donald Trump is saving our democracy”.Ouch. Do you remind Rich of that article often, I ask. “He reminds himself all the time,” Moss fires back.So what does he think is at stake for magazines like New York amid the Trump insurgency? “There’s so much at stake, our relationship to truth, to our values – all these things are truly up for grabs. As a citizen I find that very scary, as a journalist it’s fantastic. The ideas that are in play make this an amazingly interesting time to be a journalist.”He thinks Trump, and the political period leading up to him, has allowed New York to put some of its finest writing on display, from Rich to Rebecca Traister and Jonathan Chait. It has also pushed the magazine to the left, the result of “the Trump administration forcing you to pick sides”.But there’s also a sense of impotency amid the tussle between journalism and the current White House. “On the one hand, journalism matters now more than it has ever mattered, and publications including ours are better than they have ever been. Yet there’s a frustration that we can’t matter as much as we need to, that when everybody is in their own self-contained world it’s hard to break through and say something with consequence.”He speaks like a person with unfinished business. Though he insists he has no idea what he’ll do next, one thing is certain: Adam Moss hasn’t finished playing yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acc34d5e5ac70af556fa6bde0d937f8566c646/0_228_3878_2326/master/3878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d192135cdc5c0b1c81f3b4a92b707516","title":"greenland ice melting faster than scientists previously thought study","story":"The pace of ice loss has increased four-fold since 2003 as enormous glaciers are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts, causing sea levels to riseGreenland is melting faster than scientists previously thought, with the pace of ice loss increasing four-fold since 2003, new research has found.Enormous glaciers in Greenland are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the southwest region of the island, which is largely glacier-free.This suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to “become a major future contributor to sea level rise,” the research states.“We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.”The research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as erse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world’s land-based ice.“The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis said. “This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.“We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: How severe does it get?”The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa’s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass.This showed that Greenland lost around 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland’s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements.The rate of loss hasn’t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared to 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland.The fate of Greenland’s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island’s southwest may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater.Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere.Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world’s largest expanse of ice is now losing around 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe.“We are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,” said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise “if the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c52d390452fbf966c421c7a8d322f4fed6483a/0_736_1350_809/master/1350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=378e407af53d8b5cad13e7fe344dff10","title":"venezuela claims foiled attempted military uprising","story":"Government says 27 national guardsmen have been arrested and accuses ‘shadowy interests’ of launching insurrectionVenezuela’s government has claimed to have foiled what appeared to be an attempted military insurrection, blaming the mutiny on “shadowy interests of the extreme right”.In a statement, Venezuela accused a small group of “assailants” from the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) of “betraying their oath of loyalty to the homeland” by kidnapping four officials in an attempt to steal weapons that began at about 2.50am local time (0650 GMT) on Monday.The apparent uprising appeared to have been small-scale, but it is the latest sign of resistance to Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013 and has led his country into an economic slump and a humanitarian crisis.Diosdado Cabello, a leading chavista (supporter of Chávez) who is widely seen as a possible successor to Maduro, said: “Our Bolivarian armed forces will respond to attacks against the homeland … wherever they come from.“The group of robbers have been neutralised, subdued and captured, in record time, and are already confessing the details.”He added that 27 guardsmen were arrested and more could be detained as the investigation unfolded.Earlier, videos circulating on social media showed a group of armed, uniformed men promising to “re-establish the constitutional order”.A man who identifies himself as 3Sgt Alexander Bandres Figueroa tells viewers: “Get out on to the streets … It is today. It’s today … People, get out, support us.“This fight is for you, for Venezuela,” he adds in a second video entitled “Message to the glorious people of Venezuela from part of its patriotic armed forces”.Exactly what unfolded overnight remained unclear on Monday. But the newspaper El Nacional said residents of San José de Cotiza, in northern Caracas, reported hearing explosions and a confrontation, apparently between members of the group and police special forces, at about 4am.Local television stations also reported clashes between protesters and security forces on Monday morning. “We want a better Venezuela … we want freedom,” one woman is filmed telling a reporter as fellow dissenters gather around her chanting “Freedom, freedom”.Luisa Ortega Díaz, Venezuela’s exiled former chief prosecutor, tweeted her support for the “young patriots” she said were behind the revolt: “The bravery of these national guard boys shows us that yes there is dignity and willpower in the barracks to get us out of tyranny … We must support military rebellion.”Maduro began his second term as president on 10 January, despite a chorus of international condemnation. But he will face renewed pressure this week, with opposition leaders calling for nationwide protests on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of a 1958 uprising that brought down the rightwing dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez.In recent weeks, Guaidó, the president of Venezuela’s national assembly, has emerged as a key figure in attempts to unseat Maduro, with the Brazilian, Colombian and US governments offering him their support.Writing in the Washington Post last week, Guaidó denounced Maduro as a “usurper” and called on the military – whose members are being offered amnesty by Venezuela’s opposition – to turn on him. “The chain of command has been broken and there’s no commander in chief – it’s time to get on the right side of history,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a8d2d30386022bab48aac9fbea4ac2c83618eb/351_28_3901_2341/master/3901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28855aca9e7549b88c33a31a0057f963","title":"france summons italian envoy over hostile africa remarks","story":"Italian deputy PM blames migrant crisis on France’s ‘colonisation’ of AfricaFrance’s foreign ministry has summoned the Italian ambassador after Italy’s deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, blamed migrant arrivals on France’s “colonisation” of Africa.Teresa Castaldo was summoned on Monday by Nathalie Loiseau, the cabinet chief of French European affairs, over the “hostile” remarks, the Italian news agency, Ansa, reported.Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), launched his attack against France during a rally in the central Abruzzo region on Sunday.“If today people are leaving Africa is it because some European countries, with France taking the lead, have never stopped colonising tens of African states.”He called on the EU to sanction France for “impoverishing Africa” and for migrants to be taken to the southern French port of Marseille, instead of Italy. An estimated 170 people were feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean in two incidents at the weekend as they tried to make their way to Europe from Libya.Sources told Ansa the remarks were “hostile and without cause given the partnership between France and Italy in the European Union”.This is the latest fight Italy has picked against France since M5S came to power in coalition with the far-right League last June.Di Maio has never quite forgiven the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for speaking about “populist leprosy” in a reported criticism of the Italian government shortly after it was formed. Earlier this month, he urged France’s gilets jaunes, who have held several violent anti-government protests since early December, to “not give up”.Italy also summoned the French ambassador after Macron criticised Italy for “cynicism and irresponsibility” when the country’s leaders turned away a migrant rescue ship with more than 600 people onboard weeks after coming to power.Di Maio refused to back down on hearing that Castaldo had been summoned.“I don’t think this is a diplomatic incident, I think it is all true,” he said. “France is one of those countries that by printing money for 14 states prevents development and contributes to the departure of refugees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23620e0dfcd1da019b8c01f107a9367cff1e25ba/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc41d193cd482bef576da0cb6b0f8e7","title":"mnangagwa promises investigation of brutal zimbabwe crackdown","story":"Security forces apparently targeted opposition and union officials during fuel protestsZimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has called for a “national dialogue” and promised an investigation into widespread violence by security forces in recent days, after cutting short an overseas trip.The brutal crackdown followed protests last week against a doubling of the fuel price, which led to rioting and sporadic looting.The military and police appear to have targeted officials and supporters of mainstream opposition parties as well as union officials and high-profile civil society activists, rather than alleged thieves.At least 12 people were killed and 78 treated for gunshot wounds, according to the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, which recorded more than 240 incidents of assault and torture. About 700 people have been arrested and remain in custody, including 11 opposition MPs.The violence was the most extensive since the 37-year authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe ended in November 2017 with a military takeover, and has dashed any hopes for political reform.Mnangagwa returned to Harare on Monday night, curtailing a visit to Europe and central Asia to drum up investment.Human rights organisations said raids were continuing in the early hours of Tuesday, though internet and social media sites appeared to be partially returning to normal after being shut down by authorities for several days.There was also more traffic in the centre of major cities, though a significant number of soldiers remained on the streets.Mnangagwa, who won contested elections in July, said insubordination among security forces was intolerable and “if required, heads will roll”.“Violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe,” the 76-year-old ruling party stalwart said in a statement released on social media. “Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated.”He also criticised the protests last week.“Everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest. Wanton violence and cynical destruction looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms incitement and threats of violence. This is not the Zimbabwean way,” said Mnangagwa, who has been advised on his communications by a team of international consultants.The president defended the raising of fuel prices, saying it was “not a decision we took lightly. But it was the right thing to do.”Fuel in Zimbabwe is heavily subsidised and officials have said the money saved by the price rise will be redirected to buying essential commodities.The protests were stoked by chronic daily shortages of banknotes, fuel, food and medicine.Mnangagwa had visited Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan before cutting short his trip, which had included attending the Davos summit of world leaders this week.After Mugabe’s rule ended there was widespread optimism that the repression of previous decades was over, but any hopes of political reform have been extinguished. The crisis has attracted fierce criticism from western states, and will undermine Zimbabwe’s efforts to rejoin the international community.The US, UK, EU and the UN human rights office criticised the government’s reaction to the unrest.The army and police denied any wrongdoing, saying some of those who raided homes and beat people were impostors wearing stolen uniforms.Analysts are ided over whether the crisis provides further evidence of splits within the ruling Zanu-PF party and the government’s highest officials.The vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, a hardline former army general, was in charge while Mnangagwa was away. He was blamed for deploying soldiers who shot six civilians in Harare two days after elections last year.Some observers believe Chiwenga is impatient with the more moderate line taken by Mnangagwa, who they say is keen to win international legitimacy.Others believe the president and his deputy have adopted a carefully coordinated “good cop, bad cop” strategy, which allows repression domestically without tarnishing Mnangagwa’s reputation overseas.The high court in Harare ruled on Monday that the government had no powers to shut down the internet and ordered it to be restored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6363be7ba94d6d11fc73f67167cde6e92541636/0_73_1401_841/master/1401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6533b7c420d624d85cdba48b4105fa85","title":"north korea secret missile hq uncovered as nuclear summit nears","story":"Revelation comes weeks before Kim Jong-un is due to meet Donald Trump to discuss denuclearisationExperts have revealed an undeclared site that reportedly serves as the headquarters of one of North Korea’s ballistic missile programmes, weeks before the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump are expected to meet to discuss denuclearisation.The Sino-ri site, one of 20 North Korea is suspected of failing to declare, houses medium-range Nodong missiles that could be used in nuclear or conventional attacks on South Korea, Japan and the US territory of Guam, according to the report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.“The Sino-ri missile operating base and the Nodong missiles deployed at this location fit into North Korea’s presumed nuclear military strategy by providing an operational-level nuclear or conventional first-strike capability,” said the report, co-written by analyst Victor Cha.The discovery has called into question North Korea’s intentions as officials met in Sweden this week to discuss the arrangements for Kim’s second meeting with Trump, which is expected to take place near the end of February, possibly in Vietnam.The leaders have made little progress since Kim signed a vaguely worded statement committing him to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in exchange for security guarantees from Washington during their first summit, in Singapore last June.The CSIS report said the base had never been declared by the North and as a result “does not appear to be the subject of denuclearisation negotiations”.Noting that missile bases would presumably have to be part of any agreement committing North Korea to “complete, verifiable, and irreversible” denuclearisation, Cha warned: “The North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don’t disclose. It looks like they’re playing a game. They’re still going to have all this operational capability” even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities.Located 132 miles (212km) north of the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas, the Sino-ri complex is a seven-square-mile (18sq km) base that houses a regiment-sized unit equipped with Nodong-1 medium-range missiles, the report said.It might have also played a part in developing the Pukkuksong-2 ballistic missile that was first tested in February 2017, shortly after Trump’s inauguration.Satellite images of the base from 27 December last year show an entrance to an underground bunker, reinforced shelters and a headquarters, the report said.Kim Joon-rak, a spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean and US militaries had been monitoring Sino-ri and other undeclared missile bases.Sweden’s foreign ministry described talks on the forthcoming summit between representatives from North and South Korea and the US as “constructive”, adding that they had covered “developments on the Korean peninsula, including confidence building, economic development and long-term engagement”.Wire agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae0691311ed341d6d0812bf55693fd409e0a43a2/79_262_3890_2335/master/3890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be1745f622d69c57d9c238219299f21","title":"tuesday briefing labour calls for vote on second referendum","story":"Corbyn increases pressure on PM as CBI warns of Brexit hit for north-east … Shocking report on prison squalor … Jacinda Ardern defends her feminist credentialsGood morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to know about this morning.Jeremy Corbyn has opened the door for MPs to vote for a second referendum as the fight over the shape of Brexit gathered pace at Westminster. After Theresa May told MPs that Britain’s social fabric could be at risk if people are asked to vote on the matter again, Labour tabled an amendment to her Brexit deal motion calling on the government to hold a vote on two options. The first would be Labour’s own alternative Brexit plan and the second would be whether to legislate “to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition” that is supported by a majority in the Commons. It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll but did not satisfy a cross-party group of MPs who fear Corbyn’s Brexit plan has “little regard for what could actually be delivered”. May’s Brexit motion faces amendments from across the Commons and our correspondent Jessica Elgot has handily summarised them here.Meanwhile, the CBI stepped up its anti-Brexit campaign with a report today on the impact of a no-deal exit on Britain’s regions. It says the north-east of England would suffer the most because its large manufacturing sector depends more than any other region on exports to the EU.Prison squalor – An inmate at Bedford prison caught and killed rats in his cell during an inspection that found shocking conditions at the jail. Inspectors discovered a litany of other problems at the facility and a report published today says cells were “filthy and decrepit”, toilets did not flush properly, and an amputee was in a cell with no adaptations and a wheelchair that he could not propel himself. Pest control work had failed to eradicate the infestation, the report said, and described a notice on a door which read: “Please ensure doors remain shut to prevent rats entering the wing!!!”. The collapse in standards at the jail was “as sad as it is inexcusable”, the report said.‘Baby editing’ claim – A Chinese researcher who claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies faces a police investigation as authorities in China confirmed that a second woman fell pregnant during the experiment. He Jiankui caused a sensation when he announced last year that he had altered the genes of twin girls to prevent them contracting HIV. He also said a second woman was carrying a gene-edited baby and state media reports on Monday appear to confirm his claim. Such gene-editing work is illegal in China, as it is in most countries, and state media said He had kept his research hidden from authorities with the intention of “pursuing personal fame”.Greenland meltdown – Alarming new research suggests that Greenland is melting four times faster than it was 15 years ago. Glaciers on the island are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 occurred in the south-west region, which is largely glacier-free. They believe this means that surface ice is melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University, said: “The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect.”‘You’re a feminist?’ – Victoria Derbyshire has created a stir in New Zealand by asking the country’s progressive prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, if she is a feminist. In an interview on Monday, the BBC star asked Ardern on a visit to the UK whether she had any plans to propose marriage to her partner. She said she hadn’t, to which Derbyshire said: “You’re a feminist?” Ardern, who gave birth to her first child while in office last year, replied: “Oh absolutely, absolutely I am a feminist.” The exchange questioning her credentials prompted surprise in New Zealand, where a leading political commentator said people would find the line of questioning “inappropriate”.Infra dig – A man who drove a digger into a brand new Travelodge hotel in Liverpool is being sought by police after an attack thought to be over unpaid wages. Builders were putting the final touches to the Travelodge when the man repeatedly drove the digger into the building in a rampage lasting more than 20 minutes. “We’d put the last tile in, cleaned up and made sure everything was perfect,” said Samuel White, a ceiling fixer. “Then some idiot in a mini digger decided to drive through the middle of the building.”With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, our political correspondent Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again. But how did the party come to fully embrace the far right in Britain? And do its supporters know how extreme it has become?

The former England and Manchester United defender has become a pundit, campaigned against leaving the EU and knife crime, and visited schools and prisons. He has also endured the loss of his wife and mother to cancer, prompting him to back a DNA test kit business that purports to help you live a longer life. Our interviewer, Simon Hattenstone, met the budding entrepreneur to discuss his foray into nutrigenetics and, along the way, uncovers stories about the young Ferdinand’s Peckham childhood, his wild drinking sessions, and why his England teams weren’t coached properly.Warren Gatland, who ends his 12-year association with Wales at the end of the World Cup, has held discussions about his next full-time job and has not ruled out a return to the Premiership. Wasps’ Dan Robson, one of only two scrum-halves in the Six Nations squad, says he intends to stake his England claim with a long-overdue first cap against Ireland. The language used to describe Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, including “pace and power”, highlights the importance of the debate sparked by Raheem Sterling’s Instagram post and shows a need to rethink coverage of black and minority ethnic players, writes Sachin Nakrani. Moeen Ali has made peace with his role in this England Test team, insisting it is time to stop hiding behind the tag of second spinner and accept he is No 1. And the former England women’s coach Mark Sampson has apologised unreservedly to Eni Aluko and Drew Spence for remarks he made to the players while in charge of the national team.The world economic forum is under way in Davos against a backdrop of concern about the world economy. A survey of leading global chief executives shows that pessimism has risen sharply in the past 12 months amid rising protectionism and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China. Their sense of gloom was reflected overnight in markets in Asia Pacific, which were down after IMF warnings and China’s poor growth figures. The FTSE 100 is set to open down very slightly while the pound has dipped a fraction to $1.287 and €1.137.The papers are chock-full of Brexit news again today, with most considering the prospects of a second vote. The  leads on “May rules out second vote as ‘threat to social cohesion’”, while the Express has a similar concerns: “Second vote will lead to civil unrest”. The  focuses on Labour with “Corbyn backs plan for second referendum”. The Times warns “Dozens of ministers ready to quit over Brexit” and the Financial Times heralds more bad news for the PM: “May’s hopes of revising Irish backstop rebuffed by Barnier”. The Independent’s digital edition sums up the general feeling with: “Groundhog Day”.Away from Brexit, the Mail gives voice to the parents of victims of a speedboat accident: “Ramp up hunt for our girls’ killer Mr Javid.” The Mirror has an exclusive on hundreds living in a tower block covered in cladding similar to Grenfell Tower. morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergPlans for almost 380 apartments in seven blocks up to eight storeys tall on Griffith Avenue would break Dublin City Council height thresholds by more than 60 per cent, it has emerged.The application by Cairn Homes to build on a three-hectare site previously owned by the Christian Brothers is the first major housing development in the city to take advantage of Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy’s decision to scrap height caps last December.Cairn has made its application directly to the board under the fast-track process for large housing developments. Under the Strategic Housing Development system, applications for schemes of more than 100 homes, or blocks of 200 student bed spaces, are made directly to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing the local authority decision phase.However, the relevant local authority must submit a report to the board setting out its view, and the view of the councillors on the development.Councillors were yesterday told the Griffith Avenue development, at up to 26m or eight storeys, would breach the maximum height allowable for the area by 10m. However, the council’s planning department said this threshold had been “superseded” by new guidelines issued by the Department of Housing last December, which removed caps on building height.Planner Carol Smyth told councillors that although the new height guidelines “trump” the council’s rules, the council had informed the developer the scheme was in contravention of its development plan. The submission the council would make to the board would reflect its views on whether the scheme met the council’s objectives for the area and whether the height of the development would have a detrimental impact on access to sunlight and daylight, whether there might be “microclimate impacts”, and whether it was justified by proximity to a transport hub, she said.However, councillors said they wanted it made explicit they did not support the breach of the city development plan’s height rules.“The scale of the apartment buildings is totally out of character with the area and would inappropriately dominate this stretch of Griffith Avenue. The height is way in excess of that provided for in the development plan. Regardless of what the Minister and his department say, the height should at least comply with the development plan,” Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney said.Fine Gael councillor Naoise Ó Muirí said the city development plan “is my bible”, and must be defended. “This is a clear breach of height. I am not happy to throw the development plan out. I think we should defend it.”Independent councillor Damien O’Farrell said the development, which had more than three times the number of homes than a previous plan for the site, would have a serious impact on traffic, yet the developers had submitted a traffic analysis that was six years old “that is simply not acceptable”.Councillors also heard that the development would require the felling of three mature lime trees on Griffith Avenue and the construction phase would take three years.Observations on the plans can be made until February 1st. The council’s submission must be lodged by February 22nd."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765946.1548105929!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"women over 5ft 9in set to live longer and that s no tall tale","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWomen who are taller than 5ft 9in are more likely to live into their 90s than women who are shorter than 5ft 3in, according to research published in a top journal. File photograph: Getty ImagesTaller women are more likely to survive to the age of 90, new medical research suggests.Women who are taller than 5ft 9in are more likely to live into their 90s than women who are shorter than 5ft 3in, according to the BMJ published Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.The research, based on a study from The Netherlands of almost 8,000 people since the 1980s, found that a person’s height and weight may influence the life of a woman far more than a man’s. Just over 7,800 Dutch men and women aged between 68 and 70 provided information in 1986 on their weight at that time and on their weight and height when they were 20, along with details of their physical activity during leisure time, including walking or cycling to work, sports, gardening and dog-walking.Participants were monitored until they died or turned 90, whichever came first. Some 433 men, or 17 per cent, and 944 women, or 34 per cent, reached 90. Women who were still alive by that age were on average taller, had weighed less at the start of the study and had put on less weight since they were 20 years old than those who were shorter and heavier. There were no similar findings for men.The study also found that greater physical activity results in a longer life but not for both sexes.The more time men spent being physically active every day, the better their chances of reaching old age for women, 60 minutes of physical activity every day gave them the best chance of celebrating their 90th birthday, but they got no further benefit for being more physically active. Men who clocked up more than 90 minutes a day on physical activity were 39 per cent more likely to reach 90 than those who did less than 30 minutes. Every additional 30 minutes of daily activity brought a 5 per cent increase in the chances of a man reaching old age.

Photograph: Brian FarrellHaving opened a new Ford car dealership in Castlebaldwin, Co Sligo, in August, brothers David and Ray Porter are acutely aware of how the Brexit-inspired slump in the value of sterling is affecting the Irish motor trade.When they were setting up the business, the brothers approached a number of dealers in Northern Ireland and told them they would be in the market for a supply of cars if they got a good price.“They said: ‘Why would we price them well for you when we have busloads of people coming up every weekend to look at cars?’ ” says David, an accountant by profession. The trip across the Border to window-shop for cars, once sterling started to slide, had become a regular outing for many in the Republic, he believes.“It was a day out where you’d go to the North, do some shopping, get some alcohol, buy a car,” he says.The trend is reflected in statistics for last year, which saw a record 100,755 used imports being registered in the Republic (up 7.8 per cent on 2017). That compared with total new car sales in 2018 of 125,486 (down 4.4 per cent on the previous year).In Co Sligo there were more imports registered last year than new sales – 1,355 compared with 1,085.As far as the Porters are concerned, the biggest impact of Brexit so far is that people are hesitating to opt for a new car, mainly because the trade-in value of their old car is being affected by the huge volume of imports. “I can’t, for example, value a trade-in at €10,000 if someone beside me can import and sell something similar from the UK for €8,000,” says David.Another reason why the motor industry is so vulnerable to Brexit , he points out, is that there are so few countries in the EU where motorists drive on the left. “We clearly cannot replace imports from the UK with imports from France.”He doesn’t believe the Government can do much more than it has been doing in the build-up to Brexit. “I think the Irish Government is in a difficult position, to be honest. I think absolutely there should be a backstop agreement by now. It is the middle of January and this is happening at the end of March, so a backstop agreement should exist.”The accountant’s gut feeling is that there will not be a “crash-out”in March as the stakes are too high for everyone.“In 2016 I was not that concerned as I thought the issue so big there would have to be a resolution. But now, as it comes closer to March, it feels more like a game of Russian roulette.”In the Building Block co-working hub in Sligo town, many in the tech sector seem unsure what Brexit will mean. Conflict resolution is Sabine Walsh’s speciality and she reckons it’s a skill that is sorely lacking in politics across the water. She work for London-based company Mediator Academy, which provides online courses in conflict resolution to clients around the world.“The uncertainty is the worst aspect,” says the qualified solicitor.“I don’t criticise the Irish Government. I don’t think there is much they can do because they don’t know what they are planning for. But the adversarial nature of the politics we see in Britain is what gets me.”Her personal background makes her worry about the future. “I am half German, and my entire childhood was about how the whole point of the EU was that the Holocaust would never happen again.”She believes a hard border would be “catastrophic” and would “play into hands of populists and nationalists”.As someone married to a sheep farmer, she also knows how concerned that sector is. “We have no idea what the implications are. I don’t think people realise the level of trade between Ireland and the UK on a day-to-day basis.”While a new regulatory framework will affect her work in London, she is even more worried about the implications for “peace and prosperity”.“People had started to take peace, security and prosperity for granted and have forgotten that 80 years ago the English and the Germans were killing each other,” she says.“And we take a lot for granted in terms of travel. I am sure a lot of people who voted for Brexit will still want to have their beach holidays in Spain.”She believes the Government must continue to push for a backstop. “I do not think people outside the island of Ireland really realise how fragile the peace in the North is and how easily that could erupt again. There is still no functioning assembly in Stormont because the DUP are too busy propping up the UK government.“I grew up in an era where every time you crossed the Border into Northern Ireland, people were shoving machines guns in our face. It is really not that long ago, and it is not going to take much to ide the community up there again.”Denise Mulvaney, a native of Grange, Co Sligo, had been working in the tech sector in London for 10 years but handed in her notice on the day the result of the Brexit referendum was announced. Although the exact timing was a coincidence, she had been feeling uneasy in London in the lead-up to the referendum.“There was a weird atmosphere,” she says. “I love London but it was a very stressful atmosphere because of the uncertainty.”The day she made the decision to return to Ireland, she was making her usual dash to pick up her child from childcare when there was an announcement that her train was cancelled because of a fatality on the track. Looking back, she believes that as the build-up to Brexit moved up a gear, suicides on the tube line started becoming much more frequent. “There was a few a month on my line alone.”She also noted an anti-immigrant attitude, even in her own office. “People would tell me I was not a ‘real’ immigrant because I was Irish, but they would say negative things about colleagues,” she says. “I felt the media was getting people to pick on each other. I felt we were all being played like puppets.”Mulvaney, a UX (user experience) consultant who describes herself as a problem solver for the tech industry, came home in August 2016 and set up her own company, Astara Creative. Since then lots of Irish expats have sought her advice about making the same move.She understands the interest but is not convinced that Brexit will be quite the horror story many are predicting. “I keep thinking of the millennium bug and all the media hype around that and the dire warnings, but our microwaves and our alarms clocks were still working at a minute past midnight.”She is not overly confident about the Government’s approach. “I struggle with the Government anyway on issues such as how they treat our civil servants and our nurses. And I do not feel Ireland has a loud enough voice in Europe I don’t feel they are representing the passion of the Irish people on this.”Noel Mulkeen, whose company, Uni.cam, produces videos for the education sector in the UK, Ireland and Germany, says some prospective British clients seemed “shell-shocked” following the vote in the House of Commons last week. “Much of their funding is EU-reliant and the uncertainty means their ability to budget and plan is seriously curtailed.”This obviously has implications for his company. As someone who benefited from the EU in both his personal and professional life, he has other concerns. “I studied in Sweden, met my wife there and my children are back and forth. We are Europeans. Britain pulling out of that culture is a backward step. But I believe that the people who voted for Brexit and for Trump did so because they felt hard done by. People felt neglected.”He thinks the Government has been right to press for the backstop. “From what I have seen they are doing a good job. My concern would be that they may have not done enough preparatory work for a crash-out. But I still think that is unlikely to happen and that there will be an extension rather than a crash out and it will drag on for six or 12 months.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Maxwellphotography.ieThe joint session of the Dáil and Seanad was scheduled to begin after The Quality had left. It wouldn’t do to make a show of themselves in front of the President of Ireland on such a historic day for the nation.But once Michael D had spoken briefly for half an hour and the declarations and reflections were out of the way, the Ceann Comhairle was free to belt his silver bell and let loose today’s TDs for a lively parliamentary session marking the centenary of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann.As a special concession (because they didn’t actually exist on the day), members of Seanad Éireann were also invited to join in so they won’t be complaining for the next 100 years about being left out.Those compelling black-and-white photographs of that first day back in 1919 had us spoiled, still pulsating with energy, excitement and danger down all the decades. And the crowd scenes are amazing – inside and out, people pressed against the gates, blocking Dawson Street, or spilling over the balcony in the Mansion House above the packed rows on the floor.Oireachtas staff worked hard to transform the Round Room, where that First Dáil met, to lend an early 20th-century atmosphere to the surroundings. It looked great. There can’t be a bolt of blue velvet left in the country because the entire balcony, much of the walls and the Ceann Comhairle’s platform were lavishly draped with heavy, gold-fringed swags.It complemented the St Patrick’s blue (Ireland’s national colour) of the carpet. The lighting mimicked gas light and some relics of the Dáil’s past, if not quite from the opening era, added to the period feel.Former taoisigh in attendance included Enda Kenny (still a TD), Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen – who was escorted by former senator Donie Cassidy. Former tánaiste and Labour leader Eamon Gilmore was seated between former ceann comhairle Rory O’Hanlon and Mary Coughlan, who served as tánaiste between 2008 and 2011. One of her colleagues from that administration, John O’Donoghue, sat nearby.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar led the current crop of party leaders, TDs and Senators. Seating was in line with the current Dáil arrangement – Leo Varadkar and the Government party and supporting cast to the Ceann Comhairle’s left and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin heading the Opposition ranks on Seán Ó Fearghaíl’s right.As this was a joint sitting, added authenticity was conveyed by the empty seats, but fewer than normal. The ceremonial stuff began back up at Leinster House where the gathering of the politicians for the traditional taking of the selfies kicked off on the plinth for the purposes of tweeting that they were all leaving Leinster House to take more selfies in the Mansion House which they would tweet in due course.Sinn Féin arrived in force, with their Northern Assembly and Westminster respresentatives in tow. This was lovely, as their MLAs haven’t seen parliamentary action in two years since their chamber was suspended. It offered them a day out and a refresher course in parliamentary participation. And it was a nice novelty too for the MPs, who have never darkened the door of the Commons. Unlike the members of the other parties, Mary Lou and her colleagues arrived en masse, and right at the same time as the British ambassador.Meanwhile, inside, her predecessor Gerry Adams enjoyed a brief chinwag with Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner who used to be deputy chief constable of the PSNI.Micheál Martin’s front bench was conspicuous by their dark navy suits.“Fair play to them, they’re keeping up with tradition. They didn’t have a woman in the front row 100 years ago either,” sniggered a passing Fine Gael Senator.As the crowd filed in and the diplomats and EU representatives took their places in the rows behind the parliamentarians, along with former and retired members of Oireachtas staff, one observer looked down on the scene with a particularly keen eye.On the balcony, with his easel and oils, was Mick O’Dea, the renowned portrait painter and former president of the Royal Hibernian Academy. He has been commissioned by the Office of Public Works to do a painting of the Dáil 100 sitting.“I’m going to make a colour study for starters,” he explained. “I want to capture the gathering and the atmosphere as it exists now.”Beside the two tables and chairs on the platform – one for the Ceann Comhairle and the other for the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Denis O’Donovan, there was a green button-back leather seat awaiting the arrival of President Higgins, and a magnificent golden harp.When harpist Aisling Ennis plucked the first chords, it was a signal that the ceremony was about to go live on television. This put an end to the orgy of selfies among the politicians. Michael D bustled up the blue carpet to great applause and, above on the balcony, a brass quintet and percussionist from the Army band struck up the presidential salute.The Ceann Comhairle made the opening speech which was followed by a video montage of significant moments from the last 100 years of the Dáil. A woman from the film unit darted from the wings and began dabbing a powder puff on the Ceann Comhairle’s face. At least they didn’t have to contend with that back in 1919.Then Michael D delivered a thoughtful and thought-provoking address. It was around about the same time that UK prime minister Theresa May was in front of a baying House of Common. The contrast between this respectful celebration of 100 years of unbroken parliamentary democracy here and the shambles in London was not lost on the Dublin audience.The moving 1919 Declaration of Independence was read aloud by actors Áine Ní Laoghaire and Donncha Crowley and the First Dáil’s galvanising Message to the Free Nations of the World was read by former TDs in a video montage.Finally, the 2019 sitting commenced. It was an hour into proceedings and you could see the politicians were getting a little fidgety. There followed 10 speeches from the Taoiseach, leader of the Opposition, party leaders and group leaders.In a departure from Dáil practice, the speakers didn’t ramble over their allotted time. At the end of it all, the speakers of both Houses signed a Centenary Declaration and presented it to Anna Powell and Alex Gorman from Comhairle na nÓg, representing national child and youth councils.Following a final speech from the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Ceann Comhairle declared the joint sitting adjourned and the band played the National Anthem.Just a few minutes past the 5.30 finishing time, O’Dea’s canvas was safely bolted into a wooden frame on the easel. The politicians and the rest of the invited audience retired to a drinks reception next door in Fire restaurant before heading to a State reception back in the Round Room. Dawson Street remained closed to traffic until 11pm. Because they’re worth it.Normal service resumes in Leinster House today."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The real problem is that we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating. It slows the speed of eating and means you wolf down fewer calories.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:  “There is some evidence to suggest that watching screens can distract children from feeling full. What’s more, we know that children are often exposed to adverts for unhealthy food and drink whilst watching their favourite TV shows, which in turn can lead to higher calorie intake.Our screen time guidance recommends that parents and their children build screen time around positive family activities – such as sharing meals together. But with one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese, it is clear that action is needed at a national level to tackle the childhood obesity problem. That’s why we want to see Government publish their consultation on restricting junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions online, without delay, he said. The chief medical officer said she had embraced the label of “chief nanny” after years of being described as such.“It\u0027s good to be the chief nanny if it has an impact,” Dame Sally told the event, reiterating calls for extra taxes on sugary and salty snacks.“I am wearing my label with pride,” she said. However, she questioned whether a male chief medical officer would have attracted the same nickname, saying the issue “raised questions” about sexism.Advice or admonition | Dame Sally\u0026#039s previous warnings“We won\u0027t go there,” she continued. “Just make the changes and chief nanny will be happy.”And she urged politicians to listen to her calls to extend the sugar levy, extending taxes so they were placed on chocolates, sweets, and cakes as well as on milky drinks.“We need political will. If you look at outcomes think how many lives were saved by seat belts,” she said.“Think how many lives were saved by the smoking ban in public places. Think how many lives  could be saved by extending the sugar levy. Politicians do need to listen to me - and I keep telling them this,” she said.Comment: Remainer MPs could help Theresa May win around Brexiteers by taking no-deal off the table Police hunt man who smashed up Travelodge with digger \u0026#39because he was not paid for work\u0026#39French and German leaders deepening relations in extension of symbolic treatyBrexit latest news: Eurosceptics urged to \u0026#39swallow their pride\u0026#39 and back Theresa May\u0026#39s deal in order to save BrexitBrexit: What next for Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - and what are the other options?Cardiff City\u0026#39s Emiliano Sala feared to be on plane which disappeared over ChannelBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winTaiwan \u0026#39bikini hiker\u0026#39 freezes to death after falling into ravine on solo climbComment: Campaigners claim \u0026#39the people\u0026#39 want a second referendum, but that\u0026#39s not what the polls sayFamily of woman who died in speedboat crash to meet Sajid Javid to demand update on her fugitive killerPlane \u0026#39flying from Nantes to Cardiff\u0026#39 disappears from radar amid fears footballer was on boardJeremy Corbyn backs MPs\u0026#39 plan to force a second Brexit referendum Fiona Bruce \u0026#39bullied by hard-Left\u0026#39 as Labour supporters demand BBC release Diane Abbott footageWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Emmerson Mnangagwa says \u0026#39heads will roll\u0026#39 after brutal Zimbabwe crackdownComment: The Withdrawal Agreement is the only way we can guarantee Brexit won\u0026#39t be stolenMusic tuition in Scottish schools should be free, finds MSP inquiryComment: Forget dodgy dictators in designer dark glasses, this is what a very British coup looks likeJapan removes porn magazines ahead of Rugby World Cup and OlympicsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 21 january 2019","story":"Greek riot police block the stairs leading to parliament during clashes after a rally in Athens, Greece.

I see nothing but exciting and groundbreaking opportunities ahead.In a medium that is changing so quickly on a daily basis, the potential for growth is unprecedented.Our plan is, to give it all we\u0027ve got, see where we can get to and have the most possible fun along the way. It makes me smile every time I think about it.Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson described the appointment as a major coup.Commenting on the launch of Scala radio, Simon Mayo said: “There are hundreds of radio stations playing rock and pop, and only two classical music stations - until now. We’re different because we’re going all out to entertain, laugh with the listeners, and have a good time. Some of it will be familiar, some new and exciting but all timeless, beautiful and all absolutely relevant to today”.Drum and bass DJ Goldie will host ‘Goldie’s Classic Life,’ which will feature classical music mixes, alongside a narration of his own journey into classical music, explaining how it inspires him to write, perform and paint – as well as introducing listeners to exciting new classical artists.Launching on the 4th of March 2019, the station will also feature topical shows covering the influence of classical music in gaming, mindfulness and special guest weekly round ups. The sound of the station has been created with modern bespoke scores recorded by The City of Prague Philharmonic.Police hunt man who smashed up Travelodge with digger \u0026#39because he was not paid for work\u0026#39French and German leaders deepening relations in extension of symbolic treatyBrexit latest news: Eurosceptics urged to \u0026#39swallow their pride\u0026#39 and back Theresa May\u0026#39s deal in order to save BrexitBrexit: What next for Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - and what are the other options?Cardiff City\u0026#39s Emiliano Sala feared to be on plane which disappeared over ChannelBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winTaiwan \u0026#39bikini hiker\u0026#39 freezes to death after falling into ravine on solo climbComment: Campaigners claim \u0026#39the people\u0026#39 want a second referendum, but that\u0026#39s not what the polls sayFamily of woman who died in speedboat crash to meet Sajid Javid to demand update on her fugitive killerPlane \u0026#39flying from Nantes to Cardiff\u0026#39 disappears from radar amid fears footballer was on boardJeremy Corbyn backs MPs\u0026#39 plan to force a second Brexit referendum Fiona Bruce \u0026#39bullied by hard-Left\u0026#39 as Labour supporters demand BBC release Diane Abbott footageWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Emmerson Mnangagwa says \u0026#39heads will roll\u0026#39 after brutal Zimbabwe crackdownComment: The Withdrawal Agreement is the only way we can guarantee Brexit won\u0026#39t be stolenMusic tuition in Scottish schools should be free, finds MSP inquiryComment: Forget dodgy dictators in designer dark glasses, this is what a very British coup looks likeJapan removes porn magazines ahead of Rugby World Cup and OlympicsJapanese princess’s wedding back on as fiance solves family financial disputeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/29/00/hmv.jpg","title":"sports direct hmv mike ashley amazon jeff bezos retail british high street","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Ask yourself this: did anyone really believe that a bloke flogging books over the interweb out a Seattle garage would be able to create an all conquering retail behemoth that has blown up the high street, and delivered a good chunk of it into Ashley’s waiting hands.\u0026nbspThey’re calling the founder and boss of Sports Direct “Mad” Mike Ashley again now it’s emerged that he’s among the parties interested in picking up HMV from its administrators.\u0026nbspThere might be some method at work when you consider that HMV’s suppliers would presumably prefer it didn’t find itself joining the long and growing list of dead retailers, and might be prepared to offer him some sweeties to keep the music playing.\u0026nbspThe problem with that analysis was highlighted by retail analyst Nick Bubb who said: “HMV is hardly a licence to print money, given the way the physical entertainment market is collapsing, and it goes without saying that Mike ought to have better things to do.”It’s hard argue with that. And when it comes to the second point in particular you only need to compare the recent performance of Sports Direct’s core business with that of JD Sports, which this column highlighted last week. The latter is an athlete while the former looks like Ashley in a pair of Lonsdale jogging pants labouring around his local rec.\u0026nbspThat’s still pretty good given that the rest of the high street is barely able to put one step in front of the other, at least in a forward direction.\u0026nbspBut, critics say, think of where the business could be if Mike just applied himself to it.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Almost\u0026nbsptwo-thirds of\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions\u0026nbspare released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs, the report says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe now use 92.8 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass every year -\u0026nbspthree times as much as in 1970 -\u0026nbspwith a further doubling predicted by 2050. Yet most governments’ climate change strategies look primarily at measures such as renewable energy and barely consider creating a circular economy.The report calls on governments to take action to move from a linear “take-make-waste” economy to a circular one that maximises the use of existing assets, while reducing dependence on new raw materials and minimising waste. The Netherlands has set an example by introducing\u0026nbspa target of becoming 50 per cent\u0026nbspcircular by 2030 and 100 per cent\u0026nbspby 2050.\u0026nbspCircle Economy argues that innovation to extend the life of existing resources will not only curb emissions but also reduce social inequality and foster low-carbon growth. One example of how this could work in practice is construction in China where the majority of houses and roads people will use in the next 50 years have yet to be built. Trump’s EPA nominee says climate change ‘not the greatest crisis’Supreme Court refuses Exxon’s effort to keep years of documents secretClimate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementThe researchers calculate that China’s built environment emits 3.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year and is set to more than double in size by 2050, from 239 to 562 billion tonnes of material. Less than 2 per cent of China’s construction inputs are reused or recycled material, although this is improving. Increasing this proportion further can make a significant impact on emissions and help the world keep with the 1.5C maximum rise in temperature agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement.“A 1.5 degree world can only be a circular world,” Circle Economy’s chief executive, Harald Friedl, said.Applied systematically, circular business models would “tip the balance in the battle against global warming”, he said.“This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It estimates that in 2016 between 1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of food products shrank in size, while between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent increased.\u0026nbspMike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises.”Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the effect of price rises was “stealthy” in an era of low inflation.“It’s a crafty way to effectively raise prices, because even the most eagle-eyed shoppers tend to only really notice the price, so few will spot they’re getting less value for money.“In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued.“The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn’t spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her?

CHPhilippakis told\u0026nbspNME\u0026nbspin July 2017 that the political landscape was likely to inspire the lyrics of the group’s next tunes.“I think the world is obviously affecting the way we feel as iniduals,” he said.“I definitely feel that when I’m writing lyrics or music, that it’s in dialogue with what’s going on around me in isolation – so I’m sure there will be things in the lyrics to do with, not just the political climate but also the environmental situation that’s happening now.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it went without any more updates until September 2018, and then disappeared from Apple\u0027s website when the new phones were added to it.Apple\u0027s to release three new iPhones –\u0026nbspwith three cameras eachApple hasn\u0027t mentioned the iPhone SE since, and it is not clear where its future now lies. The company never announced the death of the phone, but hasn\u0027t give any indication that it is still alive either.Rumours have continued to swirl about a possible iPhone SE 2, almost as long as the original has been available. In May of last year, there were suggestions that the summer could see the launch of an update – but various Apple events, including the release of the new iPhone XS and XR, came and went without a mention of the SE.The iPhone XR seems to fulfill some of the same purpose as the SE, packing in all of the newest technology into a cheaper handset. But it is actually larger than most of Apple\u0027s phones, sitting somewhere between the iPhone XS and XS Max.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nominations will be announced on Tuesday, 22 January the ceremony itself is set for roughly a month later, on Sunday, 24 February at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre. Here are our predictions for how the nominations will pan out in the main six categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor.The Oscars have the unique ability to nominate up to 10 films for Best Picture, over the traditional five entries – a format change first put in place a decade ago. The awards race has already narrowed itself down to two fierce competitors – Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma and Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born – but there will be plenty of room for other favourites here. Green Book, Vice, If Beale Street Could Talk, and The Favourite are all sure to pick up nominations.However, 2018 offered a stellar slate of films directed by women, all boasting the right amount of prestige for awards season, among them Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace. At this point, it would be\u0026nbspan embarrassing move, quite frankly,\u0026nbspfor the Academy to reveal a slate of 10 films all directed by men.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMost likely to make the cut is Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a beautifully orchestrated character piece that will almost certainly land Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination. Unfortunately, it’s likely to lose out to First Man. Damien Chazelle’s La La Land follow-up is an early frontrunner that’s since fallen by the wayside, but it still has clout to guarantee a few nominations. Although the Academy hasn’t filled the full 10 nominations since 2010, usually opting for a selection of nine, the list below is of the top 10 contenders in the category.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Since Cuarón is heavily favoured to win in this category, any other nominee for Best Director will essentially earn the honour of losing to him. Cooper will almost certainly make an appearance, alongside Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman and Adam McKay for Vice. While The Favourite has fared well this awards season, its director Yorgos Lanthimos didn’t receive nominations at either the Golden Globes or the Directors Guild Awards, and there\u0027s certainly a feeling\u0026nbspthat voters view the film as belonging more to its stars than its director.Although the expanded list of nominations for Best Picture almost guarantees Black Panther a spot, the real test of its awards appeal will be here. The odds aren’t particularly in Ryan Coogler’s favour, since he lost out both at the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild Awards, but we could be in for a surprise. Last year’s debacle, when\u0026nbspthe Academy introduced a Popular Film category and then swiftly recalled it, may have left a lasting impression in voters’s minds, meaning 2019 could see a definitive statement made that the Academy is eager to embrace the quality blockbuster.This category may turn out to be the most hotly contested of the night. Glenn Close, Lady Gaga, and Olivia Colman have all been picking up trophies for the respective performances in The Wife, A Star is Born, and The Favourite. The Critics Choice Awards even struggled to even narrow it down to one person, sharing the awards between both Gaga and Close. Melissa McCarthy is also very likely to see a nomination here for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, while the last slot will be a contest between Emily Blunt for Mary Poppins Returns and Nicole Kidman for Destroyer.The frustrating truth of awards season is, of course, that anyone who isn’t already an established name or a massively publicised Hollywood breakout rarely gets a look-in. The result is that one of the year’s most phenomenal performances, Yalitza Aparicio in Roma, will probably end up going without recognition, even when Roma may sweep the awards elsewhere. \u0026nbspThe odds are less clear-cut when it comes to Best Actor, and there’s a chance the winner here may be partially determined by the mood of the rest of the awards race. Vice’s Christian Bale, Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek, and A Star is Born’s Bradley Cooper form a trio of strong contenders.However, their chances could depend on how favourably the Academy looks on their respective films. If A\u0026nbspStar is Born really ends up being Roma’s biggest competition, Cooper’s chances could go up. If Bohemian Rhapsody is snubbed in other categories, Malek’s chances could go down.\u0026nbspGreen Book’s Viggo Mortensen is also an easy bet here.The last spot, however, could be a little more unpredictable. BlacKkKlansman’s John David Washington is the safer choice, but there’s a question of whether First Reformed’s Ethan Hawke will make a surprise appearance here. The film, at large, hasn’t fared particularly well this awards season, despite the massive critical acclaim it received on release there’s a good chance its indie credentials (it was distributed by A24) have meant the film has been overlooked by voters.Anyone who’s seen The Favourite will be surprised to see Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both pitched here as supporting roles, since the film is quite obviously a three-hander. Call it another case of “category fraud”: studios have increasingly treated the split between lead and supporting as a strategic game, and there’s a clear hope here that The Favourite will end up with wins in two acting categories as opposed to one. However, Stone and Weisz will face stiff competition from If Beale Street Could Talk’s Regina King, with Vice’s Amy Adams and First Man’s Claire Foy also expected to receive nominations.Thomasin McKenzie should be somewhere on this list, since her performance in Leave No Trace has been praised across the board. Yet, like\u0026nbspAparicio, McKenzie suffers a combination of not being a recognisable name, not having had a major publicity push, and appearing in a fairly low-budget independent production.Mahershala Ali’s Golden Globe win for Green Book has secured him as the favourite in this category, but there’s some competition still from both BlacKkKlansman’s Adam Driver and Can You Ever Forgive Me?’s Richard E Grant. Sam Rockwell is expected to appear for Vice, although his work has been overshadowed by Bale’s formidable Dick Cheney impression. Timothée Chalamet, meanwhile, will likely continue his Hollywood ascendency and land a nomination for Beautiful Boy.However, one of the strangest exclusions from this year’s awards race is Sam Elliott for A Star is Born. The actor was an early favourite to win, but has dropped off the radar in recent months without much rhyme or reason, perhaps overshadowed in the film’s publicity campaign by the central pairing of Gaga and Cooper.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.Kevin Hart dropped out of hosting the ceremony after refusing to apologise for resurfaced homophobic tweets he made between 2009 and 2011.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the search is complicated by the fact that it is harder to see the properties of our own solar system, compared with those that we are looking at from the outside.When observing other systems, we often study the disc surrounding the host star to infer the properties of any planets in orbit around it, said Sefilian.The problem is when you\u0027re observing the disc from inside the system, it\u0027s almost impossible to see the whole thing at once. While we don\u0027t have direct observational evidence for the disc, neither do we have it for Planet Nine, which is why we\u0027re investigating other possibilities. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that observations of Kuiper belt analogues around other stars, as well as planet formation models, reveal massive remnant populations of debris.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It estimates that in 2016 between 1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of food products shrank in size, while between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent increased.\u0026nbspMike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises.”Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the effect of price rises was “stealthy” in an era of low inflation.“It’s a crafty way to effectively raise prices, because even the most eagle-eyed shoppers tend to only really notice the price, so few will spot they’re getting less value for money.“In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued.“The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn’t spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you, but believe me the truth is that no-one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum.\u0026nbsp“If you try to force us, to hurry us, you will lose everything.\u0026nbsp And for the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing.”Germany says UK should \u0027think again\u0027 on Brexit with second referendumAt the time Mr Cameron had publicly said he would try to renegotiate EU membership to get a better deal for Britain, and then hold an in-out referendum on whether to leave to stay. The much-vaunted renegotiation failed to secure any significant changes in key areas such as free movement of people. Mr Cameron went on to lose the referendum, triggering Brexit.Tusk added: “I asked David Cameron, ‘Why did you decide on this referendum, this – it’s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know,’ and, he told me ¬– and I was really amazed and even shocked – that the only reason was his own party.“But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory.”David Cameron insists he does not regret calling Brexit referendumCameron\u0027s rumoured return to frontline politics mocked by Labour MPs Tories adopting \u0027far-right ideology\u0027 says former leader of its MEPsDavid Cameron buys shepherd\u0027s hut for Cornwall holiday homeGermany says UK should \u0027think again\u0027 on Brexit with second referendumHe also recounted a telephone call with Mr Cameron ahead of the prime minister’s resignation, describing it as a “day of reckoning”.The first episode of the three-party documentary, Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, will air on BBC Two next Monday evening.Appearing in the same documentary, former French president Francois Hollande, who was in charge at the time, explained why the EU gave few concessions to the UK.“Any concessions made to the UK on freedom of movement in the EU would be easily requested by any other member state,” he said.“I said to him, honestly, if he got a special deal for the UK because there was a fear he might lose the referendum, then other countries under populist pressure would try to organise their own referendum and get their own special deal.”Another former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, recounted discussions with Mr Cameron about special protections for the City of London as far back as 2011 – which would ominously set the tone for future discussions about EU reform.Created with Sketch.

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table. MPs must now act to break the deadlock.Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal.It is time for Labour\u0027s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.Labour supporters of a fresh referendum welcomed the party\u0027s motion. Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Ashley Cowburn looks at one of the amendments\u0026nbsptabled by a Labour MP that aims to avoid a disorderly exit from the EUClick to followIndy PoliticsWill Yvette Cooper’s amendment take no deal off the table?Nothing has changed. Following the greatest defeat in modern parliamentary history over her\u0026nbspBrexit deal, Theresa May has used a statement in the Commons to outline her plan B, which appears remarkably similar to plan A.The prime minister will now seek further assurances\u0026nbspfrom the EU over the highly contentious issue of the Irish backstop –\u0026nbspsomething, of course, she attempted to do after delaying the first “meaningful vote” in December.But this is where the parliamentary battles begin –\u0026nbspas MPs can now attach amendments to the “neutral”, plan B\u0026nbspmotion, which will be tabled today by the government with a view to being debated and voted on come 29 January.One of those amendments will be tabled under the name of the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who\u0026nbspchairs parliament’s Home Affairs Committee.Government to scrap £65 fee for EU citizens who want to stay in UKTusk says he told Cameron to ‘get real’ over ‘stupid’ Brexit voteNo10 admits May needs to try ‘something different’ on Brexit- liveThe Brexit leadership vacuum on both sides has never been clearerIMF slashes global growth forecast and warns on trade warShe is seeking time for a vote on her bill to give MPs the power to suspend the Article 50 withdrawal process if there is no deal in place with Brussels by 26 February –\u0026nbspthus preventing a no-deal scenario on 29 March.If the time is allocated, and the legislation passes,\u0026nbspit would mean Theresa May has just over a month to get parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal. Failing this, MPs would be given a vote on extending Article 50 for a nine-month period.If MPs did vote for the measure, however, the EU27 would have to agree, unanimously, to grant the request to extend the negotiating period.Those backing the move by Ms Cooper are senior MPs from across the Commons, including Nicky Morgan, Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn\u0026nbspand Norman Lamb.The Labour frontbench is yet to say whether it is supporting the amendment, but one of the party’s shadow Brexit ministers dropped a pretty clear hint Jeremy Corbyn would do so.“Absolutely something we are seriously considering,” said Labour’s Jenny Chapman.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAnnouncing her proposals, Ms Cooper said the government “cannot just push the country into no deal because they have run out of time”, adding: “The prime minister should rule out no deal.“But if she won’t, and if nothing else is sorted by the end of February, then parliament should be given a vote on whether to extend Article 50 instead or it will be too late.”Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

That list already includes several notable democrats like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard.Ms Harris could also come under some fire for her tenure as state attorney general in California, a record that has generally been considered to be “progressive” but has come under fire recently as speculation has swirled about her potential candidacy.That includes criticism of Ms Harris’ seeming reluctance to embrace criminal justice reform in the state, and her record on wrongful convictions.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That many want to leave without a deal ­boggles their minds and induces fainting and nausea.So it was on Thursday as they all watched TV’s Question Time, that ­traditional safe space for left-wing, Government-bashing Remainerism.The audience in Derby hollered approval at the idea we should simply walk away on March . Thatno deal can be found, then that is at least the Brexit a majority voted for in .One Europhile writer found it “staggering, terrying”. Which, funnily enough, is how voters view a political and media elite so wedded to a comfortable status quo that they are completely disconnected from anyone outside the bubble.The Sun would prefer a deal. We just cannot support the fatal flaws in Theresa May’s. But millions, not just Leavers now, ARE ready to brave No Deal because they know that democracy must deliver what the majority voted for.Andthe Remainer elite are shocked by a few dozen Leavers on TV they had better prepare themselves.If Brexit doesn’t happen,Article  is revoked andBritain is forced to vote again, the roar of rage will deafen them.COMMONS Speakers normally get a ­peerage. We are delighted to learn John Bercow won’t.One senior minister branded him “a biased f***wit” and “repulsive beyond measure”. Not a ringing endorsement.But then a man who tore up centuries of Parliamentary procedure in his ­personal battle against the biggest ­democratic mandate in our history deserves ignominy, not honour.And that’s before you factor in serious bullying allegations against him.It is a shame he won’t also lose his £million State pension pot. But we can’t have everything.Bercow’s only hope, following his bias against the Government, is that Opposition parties put him up for a Lords seat.But that would rather give the game away, wouldn’t it THE staggering achievements of Brampton Manor should inspire every state school.It’s an academy in Newham, London — one of the country’s poorest areas. Yet  sixth-formers this year alone have got Oxbridge offers. Nearly all are ethnic minority kids, most of them the first in their family ever to go to university.There’s no big secret. Just hard graft, long hours and bright, motivated pupils encouraged to believe anything is possible. Plus tireless and dedicated staff.It’s an incredible success story.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling. It’s time to leave the EU and deliver a better post-Brexit UK economy for workers, small businesses and consumers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems.

All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest. And, naturally, other left-wing councils nationwide are following suit.How very “progressive” it all is.NO ONE expects a flag-waving jamboree on the th anniversary of troops being deployed to Northern Ireland. But why would the MoD not mark it at all It is a snub of a piece with the hounding of veterans over their actions decades ago.It stems from a corrosive political correctness in modern politicians’ attitudes towards our role in the Troubles, where , troops died quelling the IRA’s campaign of slaughter.Labour may be led by pensioner revolutionaries who supported the terrorists.That’s no reason for the Tories to forget who the good guys were — and their bravery in securing the peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463377539.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"weight loss eat table tv dinners fuel obesity","story":"Professor Dame Sally Davies warns Brits “mindlessly” scoff too many calories when chowing down in front of the telly – fuelling the nation’s obesity epidemic.England’s chief medical officer said as well as keeping off needless pounds, social interaction over the dinner table helps boost kids’ brain power.Currently, one in three kids leaves primary school overweight or obese.Being too tubby raises risk of heart disease, type  diabetes and cancer.Speaking at an event organised by think tank Reform, Dame Sally said: “We would like people to sit down and eat together.“If you look at child development, they need to interact with their families.“Proper mealtimes with healthy food are going to help our children develop effectively and probably help our waistlines.“When people are using screens or watching the television their calorie intake goes up, because you don’t concentrate on the food, the social interaction is fairly mindless and the feeling of satiation is not recognised as easily.”Last month, Dame Sally declared herself chief nanny as she outlined radical plans to tackle obesity – including a levy on chocs and crisps.Research by University College London has previously found girls who have TVs in their bedrooms are a third more likely to be fat.Another study found teens exposed to daily junk food adverts were twice as likely to be lardy.Hugo Fry, UK managing director of pharma giant Sanofi, said Brits eat badly.Speaking at the event in London, he said: “One of the reasons that drive the UK up the obesity charts is the way we eat, and the environment we do it in.“So we are massive TV eaters, grab and go eaters.“At the other end of the chart, the French they sit down as a family at every single meal.”Research by Sanofi shows more than four in five Brits say they have a responsibility to stay healthy and cut the burden on GPs and hospitals.However, only one in four was walling to get the over-s NHS Health Check.Campaigners last night backed Dame Sally’s latest nanny state intervention.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said large numbers of families do not even own a table.He said: “Prof Dame Sally Davies is absolutely right. The real problem is we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “There is some evidence to suggest watching screens can distract children from feeling full.With kids consuming the equivalent of , excess sugar cubes a year, teachers welcomed the changes — but critics warned of “fear-mongering”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463330216.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"31 stone plane passenger forces cabin crew to undress him in cramped loo and wipe his bum while he moaned with pleasure","story":"The disgusting incident allegedly occurred on an EVA Air long-haul flight from Los Angeles to Taiwan’s Taoyuan Airport.A flight attendant, whose surname is Kuo and was chief purser on the flight, alleged the unidentied man made her and her colleagues undress him in a lavatory and wipe his backside on January .During a press conference, the stewardess explained the series of events leading to the crew having to pull down the passenger’s pants and clean his bottom after he had finished relieving himself.Kuo said the man, who she estimated weighed kg , boarded the plane on a wheelchair and asked to be given three adjoining seats in economy class due to his size.As the flight was not full, he was granted his request.But this later allegedly escalated to a demand to use the plane’s business class lavatory, as he could not fit in the economy-size cubicle.She said the passenger claimed an injury to his right hand prevented him from fully undressing himself in order to use the toilet.He therefore asked cabin crew to pull down his pants in order for him to successfully relieve himself.Kuo said: “I told him we couldn’t help him, but he started yelling.He told me to go in there immediately and threatened to relieve himself on the floor.But he very angrily slapped my hand away, saying he didn’t want it and only wanted me to remove his underwear so he could use the toilet.”After granting the request, the crew was left further traumatised when the man called them into the cubicle again in order to wipe his bottom.Kuo’s chief attendant reluctantly agreed, explaining that they did not want to leave the lone passenger trapped in the loo.However, the flight attendants’ discomfort then turned to humiliation when he allegedly began moaning in apparent pleasure as the chief attendant wiped his backside while wearing three pairs of latex gloves.Kuo, who was holding onto the passenger to keep him steady, recalled: “He said: ‘Oh, mmm, deeper, deeper,’ and then accused my chief attendant of not properly cleaning his backside, requesting that she do it again.”She said the attendant repeated the action three times before leaving, at which point the passenger said: “You can pull my pants back up now.”EVA Air, which only employs female cabin crew, has said in a statement its staff are not obliged to accept demands from passengers - even those requiring special assistance.However, the Taoyuan Flight Attendants Union, which is representing Kuo and her colleagues, argue that the problem is systemic, stemming from a service industry culture that frowns upon those who do not meet the customer’s every demand.The union has suggested two solutions: ban the passenger and others like him, and begin hiring male cabin staff.Further statements from the airlines and the union are expected in the coming days.The Sun Online is unable to contact the passenger for comment on the allegations.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe.

Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV.

First I was called a peasant and then  hit several times on  the head.”The incident came two days after Prince Philip’s Sandringham crash.Patrick claims the gamekeeper battered him on the head with a stick after screaming: “Mind my dogs you f****** peasant.”Engineer Patrick said: “I came round the corner doing around mph and this toff was stood with his dogs, about  six of them.“I had to stop because they were in the middle of the road. He was waving his stick around and he hit the front of my car.“I wound down the window and before I could say anything he shouted ‘Mind my dogs you f****** peasant.’ I couldn’t believe it.“I was so furious I leapt out and shouted ‘I’m no f****** peasant. Who are you calling a peasant ’Patrick said the tweed-clad gamekeeper, who was holding some dead pheasants, accused him of almost hitting his labradors and spaniels and waved a stick.He added: “I said ‘Don’t threaten me, waving your stick around.’“He replied ‘I don’t use weapons.’ I said ‘You must have used weapons to kill those birds’ and pointed at the pheasants.“He then moved off the road and the dogs followed him so the way became clear again.“I didn’t want anything to do with it so I turned my back to walk back to the car and heard someone shout ‘No! no!’“The next thing I felt a heavy thud on the back of my head then this excruciating pain. This guy then started going ballistic.“I turned round and he’d broken his stick on the side of my head. I could feel the blood trickling down my neck.“But he just kept hitting me with the remainder of his stick like a man possessed.“He smacked me on the left forearm, on the left wrist and round both of my shoulders.“I was in shock.

Doctors have warned him to expect concussion. He also has cuts and bruises across both arms and his body.Patrick added: “After Prince Philip’s crash it makes it look like the Royals think they can do whatever they want.

He said: “I’ve always respected the Royals. But it’s about time they learned to treat the rest of the world with some consideration.”He reported the incident to police but will not make a statement until he knows he is not concussed.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Snow is most likely on northern hills but may settle at lower levels at times.Weather forecasters have said that northern and western areas are also likely to see thundersnow – when heavy snow is combined with thunder and lightning – as a polar maritime air mass moves in.A Met Office spokeswoman said: Northern and western parts are most likely to see any heavy wintry showers, and with that we could see some breaks of thunder and lightning, and heavy snow showers.When thunderstorms form in wintry conditions, they can sometimes give rise to heavy downpours of snow, along with the usual thunder and lightning, so it is called thundersnow.It is considered unusual because it can only really occur during a few months of the year.The severe conditions are expected to last until around am today.High ground is due to be the worst affected with up to cm of snow and rain which will be combined with strong winds to create blizzard-like conditions.Lower-lying areas are expected to see between -cm.The severe weather conditions have led to Public Health England issuing a level three alert for the week in northern England – meaning severe low temperatures, icy conditions and snow are expected -  and a level two alert for the rest of the country.Dr Emer O’Connell of PHE said: “Experience shows us that every winter thousands of people are seriously affected and even die from illnesses linked to the cold.Protecting yourself from the cold may seem like common sense but many people do not manage to keep themselves warm.If you know someone at risk, someone over , anyone with dementia or a heart and lung condition, or a young child, check up on them and seethere’s anything you can do to help.All of us should be heating our homes to at least C, keeping up to date with weather forecasts and planning our days around them.”Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: Skies will cloud over across Northern Ireland and western Scotland, with some rain arriving here by the end of the afternoon.Its a cold day nonetheless, feeling colder in the west as well as those winds strengthen - temperatures generally in the mid to high single figures.Its as we go into Monday evening that things could turn a little bit more disruptive, especially across the north west.We could see hill snow and some heavy driving rain here, so some tricky conditions for that journey home.That system gradually pushes its way into northern England, giving some hill snow over the Pennines, Cumbrian Vales and eventually higher ground in Wales and maybe even the moors of South West England as well.Ahead of it though, it stays clear but the winds will strengthen so not turning quite as frosty as previous nights.Then behind it, as we go through the second half of the night well see a fair scattering of snow showers pushing into the north and west.It sets us up for an icy start to Tuesday morning - be prepared for some tricky conditionsyoure heading out first thing.In its outlook for Tuesday to Thursday, the Met Office says the snow will clear and conditions will become drier and brighter.They said: An icy start as rain and hill snow clears east on Tuesday, followed by blustery wintry showers.Staying cold thereafter, though generally drier and brighter."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463458207.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"michael mcintyres big show singer stalked jealous ex","story":"Rachel Crowe was attacked by James Hall on the same day millions of viewers watched her become the comedians Unexpected Star on the BBC show.The trained opera singer had been in a relationship with Hall, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, for a year before they split in October , a court heard.Shortly after Hall, , began bombarding her with inappropriate messages from dferent email addresses, including one called “pleaseRacheldontdothis@gmail”.On January  - as she appeared on national TV - he approached Miss Crowe in a bar before following her to car and pulling her to the floor by her arm.She managed to get into her vehicle but when she tried to drive away, Hall jumped on the car bonnet and tried to rip her wing mirror off.A few days later he showed up at her house late at night, banging on the windows as she slept.He managed to climb into the back garden where he pounded on her door demanding to be let inside.She called the police but they failed to arrive in the two hours before he eventually left, the court heard.The -year-old singer, who also works as a choreographer, told police in a statement: I feel scared and afraid to leave my house.I’m afraid of coming across the defendant whilst I’m out because of these incidents.“He can be angry and aggressive. He could hurt me. I find his behaviour intimidating and worrying.As I am a singer, I am worried he could turn up as I’m working, which is what has happened on previous occasions.”Hall, a former accounts student, pleaded guilty to assault by beating and stalking Miss Crowe when he appeared at Manchester magistrates court.He appeared emotionless as he was handed a  week prison sentence suspended for  months.Prosecuting, Carl Gaffney said: “The aggrieved Miss Rachel Crowe and the defendant were in a relationship for  months.She describes an escalation regarding his behaviour towards her, and she used words such as ‘jealous’, ‘bullying’ and ‘aggressive’ to describe his behaviour towards her.“His behaviour towards her showed that he talked about their physical tendencies. There were a number of incidents also.The court heard Hall had previously appeared before magistrates in Cumbria last November for criminal damage after he had a bust up with Miss Crowe during a wedding.Halls lawyer Nick Ross said: “He recognises this is over and it’s sensible for this to be over.“His behaviour was very persistent, but only over a few days.It was not his place or position to place his arm out to restrain her, it was a little more persistent on the arm of the complainant.Sentencing Deputy District Judge Thomas Moran said: “You have clearly got a problem with relationships and you have come close to receiving a prison sentence judging by the way you pursued your former partner who is clearly terried of you.“I order for there to be no compensation offered - that is the last thing she is interested in.What she wants you to do is leave her alone,you don’t you will find yourself back here and going to prison.”Hall was also made subject of a restraining order for five years, which prohibits him from making any contact with Miss Crowe or attending her address.He must also complete a two year community order, pay £ costs and engage in a Building Better Relationships programme.Miss Crowe had wowed the audience with a rendition of Jenner Rush’s The Power Of Love on the BBC show, after being duped into going to London to visit the fictitious Museum of Humanity.She was surprised by McIntyre when he jumped out of an Egyptian coffin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463291487.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit travellers new zealand airport deported","story":"At least four of the -strong party of Brits are thought to be flying out of Auckland International Airport today  -

No progress on what Brexit means.And veteran MP Hillary Benn blasted her for failing to listen to what opposition politicians wanted, saying: While her door may have been open, her mind remains closed.The PM told MPs:Mrs May said she would be speaking to the DUP this week and other colleagues, and will go back to Brussels to tell them what is needed to get the deal over the line.We will work to identy how we can ensure that our commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland and Ireland can be delivered in a way that commands the support of this House, and the European Union, she promised.But Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn asked what hope she had of getting the deal passed after she failed to do so last month.This really does feel like Groundhog Day, he said.Some ministers think that the best way forward is to get Leavers on side to win over Tories and the DUP - rather than reaching out to Labour MPs who want a customs union with the bloc and a softer Brexit.Yesterday key Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg suggested hed rather back the deal than risk not leaving altogether.He said this morning: If the backstop could be removed altogether, so could most of the problems be removed.Mrs May also used her speech to slam reports that she could consider reopening the controversial and hard won Good Friday Agreement.The PM stressed: I never never even considered doing so, and neither would I, she said.She also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn for failing to engage in talks to get a Brexit deal done.Last week the Labour boss said he wouldnt talk to her about leaving the EU because shes refused to take No Deal Brexit off the table.Mrs May said she hoped that he would reflect on his decision and said we should all be prepared to work together to get a deal done.He says no more phoney talks - it would be nice to have at least some talks with him! she joked.It would be welcomed by big business - but Brexit voters would be unhappy because it would mean Britain accepting open borders, and following European rules without a say.HOW LIKELY   HARD AS NAILSMost of the Tory Brexiteers who oppose the PMs deal want her toto Brussels and strike a tougher line.But Eurocrats currently insist its impossible to re-open negotiations.HOW LIKELY   REFERENDUM RE-RUNDozens of MPs are hell-bent on forcing Mrs May to hold a second referendum so Britain can stay in the EU.Yet without the support of the Government its unlikely the second vote could become a reality.HOW LIKELY   DEAL OR NO DEAL If Mrs May cannot pass a deal, the legal default is that we will leave the EU without a deal on March .Despite the legal position, the majority of MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to rule out No Deal.HOW LIKELY   MAY TRIUMPHS - EVENTUALLYCabinet ministers remain adamant that a version of Theresa Mays plan will eventually pass the Commons, even after losing last night.They believe sceptical MPs will lose their nerve as Brexit Day approaches - terried of either No Deal or a second referendum.HOW LIKELY   Today Remainers are launching a move to seize control of the Brexit process.Amendments are being discussed today on what should happen next - one plan would be to give backbenchers control, and another would force article  to be extended.The world now knows that Michel Barnier never negotiated in good faith. He reportedly boasted: “I’ll have done my jobthe exit terms are so bad that the British would rather stay.”Yet Remainers want to capitulate anyway: to scrap or “extend” Article , risibly pretending it’s a pragmatic solution instead of what they wanted all along.They would force on us a dangerous second referendum, or some vague pause to avoid No Deal, disgracefully backed by Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and other Remainer Ministers.The tactics are so undemocratic the Queen might have to block them. That’s right, these MPs could force our monarch, in her rd year, into the worst constitutional crisis for three centuries.Mrs May is now taking the only good option short of No Deal — toto Brussels and renegotiate the backstop.The EU may refuse.

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure.

Ms Rudd is said to want a free vote on plans that would allow the  March Brexit date to be extendedtheres no agreement. The Work and Pensions Secretarys private warning, reported by multiple media outlets including The Times, was backed up by a government source. It comes after Ms Rudd refused to rule out resigningthe government pursues No Deal.  At an event attended by the Mirror this month she said: I have been in and out of Cabinet and I find you have more influence in Cabinet. But she did not rule out leaving the government. Other ministers including Richard Harrington and Steve Brine have suggested publicly they could go. And Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood yesterday made a thinly-veiled call to delay Brexit - using the analogy of a cake. Posting a photo of his son eating the cake, he said: Cooked a banana cake yesterday. Told my son it will be ready in  mins - according to the cookbook. It took . It was a big decision - honouring the cookbook or take more time to get the right result. Ms Rudd is believed to want a free vote on a plan by Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, that is due for a vote next Tuesday.   The plan would force Theresa May to ask the EU to extend the  March date of Brexit -there is no new deal by February . Theresa May pooh-poohed calls to extend the date of Brexit last night but did not altogether rule it out. Today, Brexit Secretary StephenBarclaywarned the EU might not support an extension to the date - eventhe UK asked for one. He told the BBC: It is not in the unilateral gt of the UK to extend. There are practical issues. They have been very clear that they dont want an extension with no purpose. And so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against.  Ms Coopers plan is the leading contender in a string of amendments by MPs which seek to block a No Deal Brexit or delay the date. The amendments will be voted on next Tuesday night. Theresa May is still trying to get agreement to renegotiate her Brexit deal, which suffered a record defeat last week. She wants MPs to ask for tweaks to the backstop clause to stop it trapping the UK under EU customs rules. But EU chiefs have already dismissed this plea.

It was hailed by backers of a second EU referendum, who called it a big step forward and grabbing the Brexit bull by the horns. Anti-Peoples Vote MPs then hit back warning they wont support going back to the public. One newspaper called it Corbyn backs plan for second referendum. But amid all the sound and fury, what Labour has suggested isnt actually as dramatic as you might think. Heres a quick explanation of Jeremy Corbyns amendment, what it will do - and what it wont do.  Labour has unveiled an amendment to Theresa Mays Brexit plan ahead of a string of showdown votes by MPs next Tuesday night. If MPs pass it, the Prime Minister would be forced to give MPs a vote on options to prevent a No Deal Brexit on March . Those options would have to include:Negotiating changes to the Brexit deal to secure Labours demands - a permanent customs union with the EU, a strong relationship with the single market and dynamic alignment on workers rights. A second referendum, but only on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.Why are people excited about it   Since September, Labour has been sitting on the fence about exactly how it should solve Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn has kept a second referendum as one option on the table, which apes a motion activists passed at the party conference. Activists are now demanding he swing % behind a second EU referendum after his bid to force a general election didnt succeed. So this new motion, promising a vote down the line on holding a second referendum, has caused lots of excitement. What do second referendum supporters say   Labour MP David Lammy of the anti-Brexit Peoples Vote campaign said: It is a big step forward that for the first time my party is acknowledging in a parliamentary amendment that a People’s Vote may be the only way forward. At the same time, the leadership is saying that Labour’s own Brexit plan should now take centre stage as this crisis unfolds.It is right that any proposal for Brexit deserves to be properly scrutinised. It is only when MPs have had the chance to look properly at these proposals, along with Norway Plus and a catastrophic no deal departure from the EU that they will really be able to decide whether they meet the promises made for Brexit in  and are at least as good as the deal we already have inside Europe. TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes said: This is an exemplary and timely amendment with Labour now grabbing the Brexit bull by its horns as May continues to pander to the far right in her party and outside it.“By all means, Labour must now push the government to negotiate a damage limiting Brexit and it is right that our Party now insist that the British people have sign off on any deal.Of course, not agreeing to the deal and staying as we are must be an option when the people do get that final say. But what do allies of Jeremy Corbyn say   Labour suggest the amendment is simply being faithful to the partys conference motion. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said it does not in any way mean the party is backing a second referendum - yet. Instead she told the BBC: The amendment is very specically-worded to allow for the debate of the options. It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way. And indeedit was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specic issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time. We are prioritising seeking a deal which provides many of the assurances we have sought from the PM. Plus - the amendment may well not pass  Leading Tory Remainers, such as Anna Soubry, have suggested they wont back Labours Plan B amendment. Without the support of a good number of Tory rebels, the amendment is unlikely to pass through Parliament. If thats the case, the MPs vote on a second referendum wouldnt happen. And a Peoples Vote might not have a majority... Under Labours plan a Peoples Vote would need a majority of support in Parliament in order to be held. Supporters of a second referendum concede it might not have a majority in Parliament yet. So has anything changed  Well of course, yes - Labour has laid out more of its plan and the path it wants to tread from here. The promise of a vote on a second EU referendum brings the party a small step closer to backing one, somewhere down the line. Butyou think itll mean a snap EU referendum just yet - you may be a little disappointed. Full text of Labours amendment [This House] “requires ministers to secure sufficient time for the UK Parliament to consider and vote on options to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a ratied Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, and that those options should include:Negotiating changes to the draft Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration so as to secure a permanent customs union with the EU, a strong relationship with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and dynamic alignment on rights and standards, in order to command a majority in the House of CommonsLegislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.”.

But out of the ashes, a string of radically dferent Plan B options are taking shape - and will wrestle for control in the Commons. The Prime Ministers own Plan B will go head to head with plans from Remain-backing MPs that could delay Brexit or stop it altogether. Labour wants to leave with a customs union, while other Remainers want to force a second EU referendum. Importantly, MPs will hold a vote on some of these options at pm on Tuesday  January - giving Theresa May a mandate toto the EU. Although the vote on her neutral motion isnt binding - what would be called an indicative vote - it will spell the way forward. So what are the biggest amendments that have been proposed so far and what will they do  Heres our rolling guide, which well continue to update as the vote draws near. Theresa Mays Plan B: Rework the Irish backstop and go back to EU in February  Theresa May ed to MPs on Monday  January to outline her own Plan B. She suggested she simply wants to tweak her -page Brexit deal - including a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules - instead of ripping the whole thing up. The PM did not categorically rule out the customs union demanded by Labour - or, crucially, extending the  March date of Brexit. But she tried to rebuff calls for a customs union, a second referendum, ruling out No Deal, or revoking or extending the  March date of Brexit. Mrs May said she will continue with further meetings this week and consult this House on its negotiating mandate before ing to the EU to try and agree a further Plan B. She also offered confidential briefings to MPs on the way forward, guarantees on workers rights, and consultation with parliaments committees. Yet key figures in the EU savaged Mrs Mays Plan B pleas as party politics. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: The Prime Ministers invitation to talks has been exposed as a PR sham. Contrary to what the Prime Minister just said there was no flexibility, there were no negotiations - nothing hadchanged. WILL IT SUCCEED  Unlikely. Itd need to EU to reopen talks on the backstop - a red line for Brussels. Itd also need around  Tory Brexiteers to cave in and decide Mays deal is the only way to prevent Brexit being stopped.  Jeremy Corbyns party has tabled an amendment which calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options. Theyd include Labours own Brexit plan - a Norway plus style agreement - and also the option for a second referendum. Party sources say the amendment is in line with the partys conference motion, which called for all options to be on the table. Labour believes its version of Brexit which would include a permanent customs union, relationship with the single market and alignment on rights and standards could get a Commons majority. But a growing number of Labour MPs want a second vote - and more than % of the partys membership also back another poll. Peoples Vote supporters hailed the amendment as a major step forward to a public ballot. But shadow minister Rebecca Long-Bailey denied it made a second referendum much more likely. Jeremy Corbyn said: Our amendment will allow MPs to voteon options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a No Deal.WILL IT SUCCEED  Unlikely. Tory Remainers signalled early on they would not side with Labours motion.   A key amendment would force Theresa May to extend the  March date of Brexit -there is no new deal by February . It is being led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles, both Remain-backers. Specically, it would allow MPs to vote on a motion directing Mrs May to request an extension of the Article  date from EU chiefs. Theres speculation that Mrs May secretly supports this because it will allow her to extend Article  without getting her hands dirty. Ms Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: I think sheknows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. Shes refusing to do so and I think shes hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership. WILL IT SUCCEED  It has a fair chance. Tory Remainers Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan already back the bid, andthe Labour frontbench joins in, it has a reasonable prospect of passing. Dominic Grieve: Backbenchers can take control of them agree   A second, more radical amendment, drawn up by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, would allow something big. MPs would be able to take control of the timetable in the House of Commons - by a minority voting for it. Usually the government has control of the agenda in the Commons, which stops backbenchers going rogue and passing laws. But under Mr Grieves plan,formal business it proposed by at least  of the  MPs - from at least five parties and including  Tories - it would be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day. Downing Street figures branded it a coup. But Mr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to vote on a string of alternatives. These could include a soft Norway-style deal or a second referendum. WILL IT SUCCEED  Its quite possible, but expect Tory MPs to wobble at something thats been branded a coup. Alliance of the forces of enlightenment Supporters of the Cooper Grieve plans are understood to have agreed to come together. One MP involved in the discussions told HuffPost: “It looks like the forces of enlightenment will be advancing on several compatible fronts when it comes to amendments.” It is understood the two camps will table compatible motions. These stand a good chance of passing with the combined weight of supporters for both amendments and the support of the Labour leadership. The Labour leader told the Commons on Monday: “We will, as we have said consistently from the beginning, back amendments that seek to rule out the disaster of no deal.” Hilary Benn: Let MPs choose between four ways forward  A separate amendment by Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, would give MPs indicative votes on the way forward. MPs would choose from dferent options to see which would come out on top. They are:Another vote on Theresa Mays deal A No Deal Brexit Renegotiate the deal with EU to achieve a specic outcome A second EU referendumWILL IT SUCCEED  This amendment has emerged late so its chances of success are not yet clear. A doctors amendment: A straight vote on a second EU referendum  Pro-EU MPs who happen to be doctors are preparing to call for a straight vote on a second referendum, The Sun reports. Tory Dr Sarah Wollaston is leading the bid along with Tory ex-Minister Dr Philip Lee, Labour’s Dr Paul Williams and Dr Philippa Whitford of the SNP. Ms Wollaston told the newspaper: “It’s all about informed consent. You wouldn’t opt for surgeryyou didn’t know the operation you were having. And here, Theresa May is the surgeon.” WILL IT SUCCEED  The MPs involved are reasonably respected, but not enough detail is known yet. Plus - how the Queen could get dragged in   Theresa May could drag the Queen into a showdown with Parliament,MPs try to cancel or postpone Brexit. Former top government lawyer Sir Stephen Laws said trying to change the law in this way through an amendment, without the Government’s participation, could create a constitutional crisis. In a paper for the Policy Exchange think tank, Sir Stephen said: “It could raise a question whether the Government would be entitled or might feel required to reassert its constitutional veto by advising the Queen not to grant Royal Assent to the Bill. “How should the Monarch react to such advice  The answer is not straightforward and the prospect of it needing to be considered in a real le political crisis is unthinkably awful. “It is a sacred duty of all UK politicians not to involve the Monarch in politics. They have a constitutional responsibility to resolve dficulties between themselves in accordance with the rules, and so as not to call on the ultimate referee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour launches bid give mps","story":"NewsLabour launches bid to give MPs a say on their Brexit deal and second referendumJeremy Corbyns party has tabled an amendment which calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options - including a second voteShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsLabours amendment \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour has launched a bid to stop no deal Brexit and shape the UKs future relationship with the EU. Jeremy Corbyns party has tabled an amendment which calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options. Two of those should include Labours own Brexit plans which is a Norway plus style agreement and also the option for a second referendum or public voted. Keir Starmer boosted the hopes of Labour supporters of a second referendum at the weekend when he confirmed the party was now at the final stage of its Brexit plan as set out in its September conference. Labour believes its version of Brexit which would include a permanent customs union, relationship with the single market and alignment on rights and standards would command a majority in the House of Commons.  Party sources say the amendment is in line with the partys conference motion agreed in September. In recent weeks the leadership has insisted that all options remain on the table. But there are a growing number of Labour MPs who want a second vote - while more than % of the partys membership also back another poll. Jeremy Corbyn said: Theresa May has shown today that she has no Plan B after the comprehensive rejection of her botched Brexit deal by MPs last week. The prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table. MPs must now act to break the deadlock. Our amendment will allow MPs to voteon options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a No Deal. It is time for Labours alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote. Wording of Labours amendment:  and requires ministers to secure sufficient time for the UK Parliament to consider and vote on options to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a ratied Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration., and that those options should include: i negotiating changes to the draft Withdrawal Agreement andPolitical Declaration so as to secure a permanent customs union with the EU, a strong relationship with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and dynamic alignment on rights and standards, in order to command a majority in the House of Commons ii Legislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a propositionthat has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays brexit groundhog day","story":"NewsTheresa Mays Brexit \"Groundhog Day\" with Plan B almost identical to Plan AThe Prime Minister failed to impress with her latest updates while fuelling speculation that she may delay Brexit and extend Article ShareCommentsByPippa Crerar:,  JAN NewsMay has been warned by Amber Rudd that dozens of MPs are ready to quit next week unless she rules out a no deal Brexit \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May was accused of being stuck in a Brexit “Groundhog Day” after presenting a Plan B almost identical to her rejected Plan A. The Prime Minister told MPs she will press the EU for more concessions on the unpopular backstop. Government insiders said they hope the EU would be spooked by the clock running down to a no-deal scenario. But it was far from clear that the bloc was willing to give enough ground. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said nothing had changed, despite the PM’s deal being rejected by a record margin last week. He said: “What makes her think what she tried to renegotiate in December will succeed in January  This really does feel like Groundhog Day.”  There was just one major U-turn, with Mrs May saying she was scrapping the pound fee for EU citizens to stay after Brexit, at a cost of poundmillion. Otherwise, the changes were cosmetic. There was little detail on her offer of legal protections for workers’ rights and environmental safeguards and she refused to rule out leaving with no deal as it would not be “honest”. And she suggested a second referendum could “damage social cohesion” by undermining faith in democracy. MPs countered that her approach to Brexit was causing the real ision. Downing Street later denied Mrs May was suggesting there could be riots. The PM also fuelled speculation she plans to delay Brexit Day by refusing to explicitly rule out extending Article . When pressed, she rowed back from a previous commitment to say she was working on a deal “such that we can leave” the bloc.  Welfare Secretary Amber Rudd has warned dozens of ministers are ready to quit next week unless no-deal Brexit is ruled out. The Remainer believes ministers should get a free vote on extending Article . With cross-party talks stalling, the PM’s bid to break the deadlock looked doomed. Senior Tories persuaded her any attempt to compromise with Labour would terminally split their party. Instead, her focus was on offering Brexit bribes to the DUP and hardline MPs over the backstop on the Irish border – and the overtures showed early signs of working. The DUP’s Nigel Dodds praised the PM for “good engagement” and “willingness to try and reach a consensus”. Insiders clung to suggestions from Poland of a five-year time limit on backstop plans. But EU chiefs once again ruled out any changes. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Mrs May already had the “best possible” deal. And Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney said a backstop end-date did not represent EU thinking.  Tory Remainers were furious at the PM’s bid to win over Brexiteers and Anna Soubry said: “Here we are with another week of can-kicking – and the truth is, shynothing’s changed.” Sarah Wollaston added: “It’s like last week’s vote never happened. Plan B is Plan A.” Labour MPs were also angry, with Angela Eagle accusing the PM of “playing chicken” with her own shyBrexiteers and the DUP. It came as senior backbenchers began tabling amendments to the Brexit plan to let MPs take control. Labour’s Yvette Cooper was planning a move to delay departure and leading Tory rebel Dominic Grieve plans for MPs to get an “indicative vote” to seeany other deal option could win a majority. But they both need Mr Corbyn’s backing and the Labour leadership is eyeing all proposals with caution. Downing Street said Parliament was unlikely to have a second binding vote on the PM’s deal until February – playing down the shyimportance of next week’s vote. Meanwhile, former Government lawyer Sir Stephen Laws said the PM could drag the Queen into a showdown with ParliamentMPs try to cancel or postpone Brexit – but this could create a constitutional crisis.

However, weeks later they realised their blunder when a local farmer got in touch to say it was a model. Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said: It is obviously disappointing to learn of this development, but it also adds an interesting element to its story.   That it so closely copies a regional monument type shows the local knowledge, appreciation and engagement with the archaeology of the region by the local community. I hope the stones continue to be used and enjoyed - while not ancient, it is still in a fantastic location and makes for a great feature in the landscape.

One  failed a fire test in Dubai which should have lasted at least an hour after just  minutes. But families were not told for weeks and the firm which built the X shyEastlands block in Manchester tried to cover up the shock results. Fire safety expert Geoff Wilkinson said: “It is immoral.” With the furore from Grenfell still raging, residents of other tower blocks would expect to be toldtheir buildings have similar shycladding to that in the killer blaze. But families living in one were kept in the dark after  covering their homes failed a fire test within just two months of the inferno – a move branded “immoral” by safety experts. And there was fury as the firm that built the block tried to “cover up” the shocking results by demanding those who carried out the examination signed non-disclosure agreements. Leaked test footage handed to the Mirror showed flames leaping up a replica cladded wall within  minutes and reaching temperatures of more than C –  minutes quicker than the recommended guidelines. The exercise was abandoned after  minutes over safety fears. But residents at the eight-storey X Eastbank block in Manchester were not told about the test until seven week later, when we approached them.  Construction firm Forrest went into shyadministration allegedly without passing the damning test report on to the buildings’ owners. It comes as latest government figures show just five out of  private residential blocks have had their Grenfell-style shycladding, or aluminium composite material, removed.  Building inspector and fire safety expert Geoff Wilkinson said: “If this building failed its test so quickly then that is indicating that there is a risk of external fire spread. The correct and moral thing to do is to remove the cladding and replace it.   “The moral thing is certainly to make the residents aware. It is immoral not to have notied someone there is an issue and that you are putting measures in place. You should be aiming to review the information and putting shymeasures in place within a week or two at the most.” Resident Kostas shyDespotelis, , added: “We have heard nothing about this test. It is worrying.” shy Neighbour Nadia Elzenaty said: “We were not aware of this. I knew a lot of companies were testing this cladding after the fire at Grenfell. It is shydisappointing. X should have someone chasing this up.  “They have a duty of care. There are a lot of tenants in this building. I know it is expensive to fix but you cannot undo the damage of lives lost.” Building regulations require a -minute fire protection barrier between shyapartments in a block. In August , Eastbank was found to have potentially dangerous cladding in a fire brigade shyinspection. But a blaze spread test was not carried out until  months later. Emails seen by the Mirror show the Dubai-based testing firm told Forrest on November : “The assembly fire test was conducted today at our facility.  “Please be informed that the assembly did not meet the acceptable criteria stated in BR  classication standard [for fire performance of external thermal insulation].” Forrest, which was in financial shydficulty, did not pay for the test in full and two weeks later demanded the firm signed a NDA. It wrote: “It’s a v simple shydocument, it merely says that you won’t pass details of the test on to rd parties.” A representative of the testing firm replied: “Why is this requiredForrest is taking the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the building and its residents  “Signing the NDA blind would then implicate me in any cover up … I am not prepared to allow the people living in that building to be exposed to that kind of risk.” A Forrest employee replied on December  that “unless the NDA is signed we are reluctant to pay it. That’s the position of our main board not me personally”. Nick Sweeney, chief executive officer at X Developments, which owns the property, confirmed his firm knew the test had taken place and had been “made aware” of the shypreliminary findings received by Forrest. He said Forrest had “indicated that the [cladding] assembly did not meet the BR  classication” but had not handed over the test report. Mr Sweeney insisted additional fire safety measures were put in place when the cladding was first identied, including a “waking watch” to alert tenants to evacuate a fire. He said the building was “safe and habitable”. He added: “We’ve been awaiting the final report so we can then consider what works are required to the building.  “X have received a preliminary statement from Forrest but the draft report had not been provided to X prior to you providing the redacted version of the draft report. “We are meeting our professional team to discuss its contents and we will be putting in place such shyremediation strategy as is necessary. “X has delivered letters via email and through a hand delivery through each door informing the residents that the cladding system is being tested and informing them of the enhanced fire safety which has been adopted. “X has agreed an enhanced fire strategy with the fire officer which will remain until the testing has been completed andrequired any shyremedial works undertaken. “X was not aware of the emails between Forrest and [the testing company] nor of the NDA. The NDA is irrelevant to X as we will not be bound by it and will be providing, as we have done to date, full shyinformation we hold to both the fire officer and the government department.” Since being contacted by the Mirror, X has announced it “will be removing the cladding which is affixed to part of the exterior of the building and replacing it with a new system”. The administrators of Forrest would not comment.  Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said Eastbank was inspected in  and the shycladding was “considered to present a risk of external fire spread”. A spokesman added: “A change to the evacuation strategy was agreed. A number of actions were agreed including the provision of a waking watch in line with guidance from the Government and this was shyimplemented immediately.” The fire service will now “monitor plans to remove and replace the cladding”. X Eastbank, where the  flats cost between pound and pound, a month to rent, was completed in . The Grenfell blaze was started by a faulty fridge freezer at the block in North Kensington, West London, on June , . It spread up the external cladding on the -storey council building, killing  people. Police are considering offences including shycorporate manslaughter. The tragedy sparked a review of building safety. The Ministry for Housing, shyCommunities and Local Government identied  high-rise blocks with ACM [aluminium composite material] cladding, including the  privately-owned ones. Apart from the five private towers that had it removed, figures released last week showed work was underway on another nine. Owners of  blocks said they had “remediation plans in place”, while  “intended” to remediate. But in  buildings shyremediation plans were “unclear”. The Government has spent poundmillion replacing such  on social housing but private owners are accused of lagging behind.

Andrew Newman has snapped up one of the countrys most luxurious new build homes, after making an estimated poundmillion from selling overpriced tickets to gigs at venues across Scotland. The tout, who also works as a computer and IT expert, is reported to have had dealings with thousands of people desperate to see their favourite artists, in venues such as Glasgow’s SSE Hydro. Many of those customers have forked out hundreds more than the original sale price of a ticket, reports the Daily Record. Newman has also been pictured with his German fianceacutee Melanie Rein, who has previously spoken about their luxury lestyle on Facebook.   His move to the opulent new home came to light after ticket site Viagogo was forced to start naming some of the biggest touts on their books. And a court order won by the Competition and Markets Authority at the High Court forced the site to list some of its biggest touts.

Singer Rachel Crowe, , was stalked and assaulted by her ex James Hall on the same day she became the comedians unexpected star on the Saturday night programme. On January , Hall approached Miss Crowe in a bar and followed her to her car where he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to the floor. When she managed to get into her vehicle, he attempted to rip her wing mirror off and jumped on the car bonnet as she attempted to leave. On another occasion, Hall, , from Bolton, Greater Manchester went to Miss Crowes home and woke her up during the early hours banging on the front window, begging her to take him back.He also hounded Miss Crowe with  emails in just three days from dferent email addresses, one such being “pleaseRacheldontdothis@gmail”.In a statement to police Miss Crowe, a trained opera singer who also works as a choreographer, said: I feel scared and afraid to leave my house. I’m afraid of coming across the defendant whilst I’m out because of these incidents.   “He can be angry and aggressive. He could hurt me. I find his behaviour intimidating and worrying. As I am a singer, I am worried he could turn up as I’m working, which is what has happened on previous occasions.” At Manchester magistrates Court, Hall, a former accounts student, pleaded guilty to assault by beating and the stalking of Miss Crowe. He appeared emotionless as he was handed a  week prison sentence suspended for  months. Prosecuting, Carl Gaffney said: “The aggrieved Miss Rachel Crowe and the defendant were in a relationship for  months. She describes an escalation regarding his behaviour towards her, and she used words such as ‘jealous’, ‘bullying’ and ‘aggressive’ to describe his behaviour towards her. “In October last year they split up. There were two sets of incidents. Firstly, there were hundreds of emails sent to the complainant from a number of dferent addresses which had been found. “Some of them were made out to be humorous in an attempt to be playful, but this was beyond inappropriate. For example, one of the email addresses was “ pleaseRacheldontdothis@gmail ”.“It was a dull echo of what it was like when she could have been with him, it was described. The emails are benign. The emails became far more frequent as he asked to be taken back. “His behaviour towards her showed that he talked about their physical tendencies. There were a number of incidents also. “The aggrieved goes out on January th. She is out with a friend when he appeared in the same bar demanding to speak to her.   “He appears in front of her face. She manages to escape when her group go to a dferent bar. He followed her into the bar but he was refused entry to the establishment. She became successful in hiding. “However, when she leaves to go to her car out the back, he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to the ground. She managed to get up and get into her car and locked it. “He then started trying to rip her wing mirror off before jumping on the bonnet of her car trying to stop her from leaving. He was taken off the bonnet by assisting people. “On Janaury th the aggrieved was at her home address when the second incident occurred. He was outside her address uninvited and unsolicited. She was woken up by banging on the windows as the defendant attempted to gain entry. “She was concerned about the noise so went to the front of her address and the defendant was there, begging to get in, but she refused. She remained at the front of the address and she phoned the police and texted her mother and told her she needed to come due to him being outside.   “The defendant then moved round to the back of the address and climbed into the rear garden where he continued banging on the rear door shouting at the aggrieved to let him in. “The defendant was there for up to two hours before he left the address. The police did not come in that timescale. After being arrested, he made signicant admissions and there was immediately no hesitation to guilty pleas. He is a man of a certain physical stature. The court heard Hall had previously appeared before magistrates in Cumbria last November for criminal damage after he had a bust up with Miss Crowe during a wedding.   A probation report compiled by an unnamed author said: “He tells me he didn’t pull the victim to the floor at all, though he did acknowledge jumping on the car bonnet when he thought she was going to drive at him. “Regarding the texts and emails, he said he did make contact as described, but said the victim had sometimes responded to his contact and he said this caused him to make further contact. He used her response to his emails as justication for his actions without giving considerable thought for the impact on the victim. “He said this was a turbulent relationship with the victim because of his alcohol misuse, caused by his dficulties sleeping. This was an angry reaction to the breakdown of the relationship. He kept his own thoughts above that of his victims. He would benefit from intervention to address the offending of this nature.” Halls lawyer Nick Ross said: “He recognises this is over and it’s sensible for this to be over. Regarding the conviction for criminal damage, he ‘kicked off’ at a wedding whilst in drink. He caused some damage to some items at the wedding. He found himself homeless after a fall out with his father. “His behaviour was very persistent, but only over a few days. It was not his place or position to place his arm out to restrain her, it was a little more persistent on the arm of the complainant. He did do that and recognised he was overstepping the line. This assault was not a punch or a kick or a slap.”   Hall was also ordered to complete a two year community order, pay pound costs and he was ordered to engage in a Building Better Relationships programme. Sentencing Deputy District Judge Thomas Moran said: “You have clearly got a problem with relationships and you have come close to receiving a prison sentence judging by the way you pursued your former partner who is clearly terried of you. “I order for there to be no compensation offered - that is the last thing she is interested in.

Mr Freeman - nicknamed Mr Loophole - said there is there is no requirement for the Duke of Edinburgh to do anything as a criminal investigation has started. He said it would be wrong to apologise while liability or culpability for the crash has not been established. But Mr Freeman added thatthe duke is culpable, he should save taxpayers money and admit his guilt. A criminal investigation is going on so theres no requirement for the Duke of Edinburgh to do anything of provide anything, he said. If he apologises, he could be admitting hes guilty. The dukes Land Rover was in collision with a Kia carrying Emma Fairweather, an unnamed female friend and her a nine-month-old baby near to Sandringham on Thursday.   Ms Fairweather, who broke her wrist on the crash, claims she has not received an apology from the royal family even though she could have been killed. She told the Sunday Mirror: It would mean the world to mePrince Philip said sorry but I have no ideahes sorry at all. What would it have taken for him and the Queen to send me a card and a bunch of flowers   Ms Fairweathers friend also required hospital treatment but her baby was unhurt.Mr Freeman said in most accidents people dont apologise and the duke should keep his own counsel. He added: The duke has three options: wait and see what happens with the investigation, grab the nettle and cough up to what hed done and offer to surrender his licence or he can attempt to get round it.  Buthes guilty he could save the taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds and come out and say, I was at fault. The duke was reportedly overheard telling police at the scene that hed been dazzled by the sun. Mr Freeman previously said the duke could be prosecuted for driving without due care and attentionhe was deemed to have made a mistake. But, he added,the sun was so low that it was in his eyes and made it impossible to see, that could afford him a defence.

But imagine, for a moment, that one little thing was dferent. Britain has been plunged into mourning by the death of Prince Philip in an horric car accident. In a tragic echo of Princess Dianas death  years ago, it is thought he was not wearing a seatbelt. The Queens strength and stay of  years was killed after he stopped his Land Rover at a junction and was hit by a second vehicle...Or perhaps: A Greek migrant is being hunted by police after crashing into a car carrying a young mum and baby on their way home from a day at the beach. The identity of the man, considered a menace by local road users, is known to officers. It is thought he is married to a local woman, although it is not clear whether he has a legal right to remain in the UK...Or even: Third-in-line to the throne Prince George escaped unscathed after his mum the Duchess of Cambridges car was in a smash on a death-trap road. The woman driver of the other vehicle, who also had a child in the back seat, was breath-tested at the scene... The fact a -year-old was involved in a collision has been used to demand older people resit their driving tests, have their licenses revoked and or be confined to barracks.But as the RAC has quite reasonably pointed out,you revoked the right to drive of those people most likely to have a smash, it would mean young people had the most to lose.So imagine a younger household name was involved: Road safety campaigners demanded footballer Raheem Sterling be jailed after a car smash with a young mum and baby. The controversial midfielder, , was seen getting behind the wheel again just a day later, and our exclusive pictures PROVE he didnt even wear a seatbelt. Young people are a bloody menace on the roads, said Prince Philip, while unveiling a plaque just a mile from the crash scene...But the problem isnt age. The problem is us, and our attitude to royalty. Had Raheem Sterling broken a womans wrist in a car accident, leaving her to get washed and dressed with help of her teenaged son, facing two months off work and possible surgery to rebreak the bones and a letime of that wrist never being quite right again, she wouldnt expect his girlfriend to send flowers. Anyone in that situation would more likely be spitting tacks at the thoughtless arsehole who caused a painful injury to a complicated joint that will require a year of rehabilitation, and would be demanding the insurance company screw him for every last penny.And theyd never expect a personal apology, on the grounds everyone in an accident knows admitting responsibility is something best left to the lawyers. The victim probably wouldnt say it could all be resolved with a phone call from Raheem askingshe was all right, because shes such a big fan of Man City.  And had Prince Philip been just about anyone , the accident might not have happened.The Royals do not know what traffic is, because they are never stuck in it. There are chauffeurs, advanced driving experts, and motorcycle outriders ensuring that they can whizz up the hard shoulder, shoot through the lights and ignore the right of way. When Philip drove his own London taxi to get around the capital, it was so he could AVOID traffic.When they get to wherever theyre going, the gates are open. Someone salutes. People wave. Everyone keeps clear of the wheels, which, of course, are always clean. You will never see a Royal in a car that has fingermarks in the weeks worth of road splatter around the doors. Youll never see their wing mirror with a ding or the wipers on their last swipe. Prince Andrew has been accused of ramming gates with his car at Windsor, and knocking over a police officer at the gates of Buckingham Palace. Princess Anne has been done for speeding at mph, and when Prince Edward was courting Sophie Rhys Jones her neighbours got used to ing into hedges to avoid being mown down as he whizzed along the country lane leading to her family home.They all do it. If that family lived in a Hackney high-rise, theyd all have an ASBO. Perhapsthey had experiences more like the rest of us, then when he pulled up to a T-junction where the sun was dazzling his vision the Duke of Edinburgh would have stopped until he could see there was no traffic.Someone with no experience of traffic, though, would assume the road was empty and just pull out. Andsomeone that daft and entitled was behind the wheel of what was literally an armoured vehicle - regardless of their age - theyd get nicked by police. If they had been ploughing into other cars on a semi-regular basis throughout their driving career, theyd get taken to court.Andthe police actually LIVED with them and spoke to them EVERY DAY, it would happen in minutes. Royals have always, traditionally, been pretty deadly. When they were around, serfs were more likely to be beaten, maids certain to be ravished, and large public protests far more likely to see their leaders run through with a sword. Wars were inevitable with every marital breakdown or romantic refusal.Removing some of their powers was a great idea, but giving them -wheel drive and several tons of moving metal to fling about the countryside at whim probably wasnt. The problem weve got is that we treat the Royals like a dferent species, and are disgusted when they act like one.We want manners and Britishness but we get rude Prussians, with fat fingers and tin ears. We bow and scrape and curtsey and mutter about why they arent a little more thoughtful, while removing from their lives all things that require deep thought - careers, taxation, a lack of opportunity.As long as we have a Royal Family that is allowed to own the place, they will continue to act like they do. Butwe demanded they had lives more like ours, they wouldnt be Royal any more - thered be nothing special about them, or perhaps more importantly us. Thats why we put up with them we like to think it rubs off.There is a solution, though: remove the gates from their palaces so they cant get out. Theyd still have lots of space to drive around, theres no traffic to bother them, and we all get to live another day."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy 16 london council estate","story":"NewsSchoolboy, , from London council estate wins £, Eton College scholarshipState school student and East End lad Hamid Patel, , has become an rising political star and is heading to the private school favoured by the royalsShareCommentsByTom BarnesMatthew Young:,  JAN NewsHasan Patel has earned a paid place to top private school Eton favoured by the famous \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager who shares a two-bed council flat with four family members has won a pound, scholarship to Eton.

The ice is melting quicker than experts previously thought, and they say it will likely lead to faster sea level rises, due to the continued, accelerating warming of the Earths atmosphere. The study flies in the face of US President Donald Trump who has repeatedly denied the scientic consensus on climate change. He once claimed the phenomenon was a Chinese hoax intended to hurt American exports. Researchers concerned about global sea level rises have focused on Greenland, where large glaciers stream iceberg-sized chunks of ice into the Atlantic. The chunks float away, eventually melting.   But a new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the largest sustained ice loss from early  to mid- came from the countrys south-west region, which is mostly devoid of large glaciers. Study lead author Professor Michael Bevis, of The Ohio State University in the States, said: Whatever this was, it couldnt be explained by glaciers, because there arent many there. It had to be the surface mass - the ice was melting inland from the coastline. The melting, which Professor Bevis and his colleagues believe is largely caused by global warming, meaning growing rivers of water are streaming into the ocean during summer.   The key finding from their study is that parts Greenland, which previously had not been considered a serious threat, will likely become a major future contributor to sea level rise. Professor Bevis said: We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers. But now we recognise a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea. He said the findings could have serious implications for coastal US cities, including New York and Miami, as well as island nations that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels. And he warned there is no turning back.   The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming - its too late for there to be no effect, he added. This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point. Climate scientists and glaciologists have been monitoring the Greenland ice sheet as a whole since  when NASA and Germany joined forces to launch the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as GRACE. It involves twin satellites that measure ice loss across Greenland. Data from the satellites showed that between  and , Greenland lost around  gigatons of ice per year, equivalent to an annual sea level rise of . inches.   But the rate of ice loss across the island was far from steady. Professor Bevis team used data from GRACE and from GPS stations scattered around Greenlands coast to identy changes in ice mass. The patterns they found show an alarming trend - by , ice was being lost at nearly four times the rate that prevailed in . And the biggest surprise was that the acceleration was focused in south-west Greenland, a part of the island that previously hadnt been known to be losing ice that rapidly. The scholar’s findings are at complete odd to Trump’s views.   Only on Sunday, the US leader mocked the issue of climate change as eastern America was hit by temperatures as low as -C. He tweeted: “Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record-setting cold. “Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!” Trump was trolled on social media for his lack of understanding of climate change confusing it with simply cold weather.

The holidaymakers - thought to be from Liverpool - had been issued a deportation notice after being accused of a string of offences. The group have incurred the wrath of the country after allegedly dumping rubbish, stealing from shops and threatening locals. Although they had been told to the leave the country, they were said to have  days to depart. However, sources have now told the New Zealand Herald that at least four were booked on an international flight in the afternoon, local time.   Several of the group were confronted outside Auckland International Airport with luggage this afternoon but sped off before giving any answers. It is not clearall of the -strong group are departing and alsothe final destination is back to the UK. It comes after several of them were named in media reports, including Barbara, Joe, and Eileen Doran. Among the accusations leveled against the tourists are:Leaving rubbish on Takapuna beach before a boy in the group - thought to be eight years old - threatened to knock the brains out of a local who challenged them Causing chaos on a flight to New Zealand Threatening journalists and grabbing a reporters phone before deleting footage Walking through a drive-through section at a Burger King, prompting police to be called Refusing to pay for meals at Backyard Bar and Restaurant after claiming there were ants in their food Threatening staff and leaving without paying at Artwok eatery in Takapuna Refusing to pay for  of food - the equivalent of pound - after claiming there was hair in it at Mr India in Northcote   In newspaper interviews, Joe Doran had given his name as John Johnson, and claimed his grandfather is the th richest man in England - prompting him to be nicknamed Honest John. Another member of the group, -year-old Tina Cash, appeared in court on Wednesday last week charged with theft. Barbara, , has claimed the family are being tortured after their antics attracted interest around the world, and thousands called for them to be deported.   She told Daily Mail Australia that she was left very, very frightened. Among the accusations against the unruly family are that they have repeatedly eaten at restaurants but refused to pay. She said: Im not going to go and get food without paying for it. Im not going to put myself that low. Joe Doran, claiming to be a dad-of-three named John Johnson, told News Hub: We are a respectable family, we are a British family who have come here, as a Commonwealth country, to see New Zealand, to see the Hobbits and see the mountains. The way we have been treated, intimidated, we are scared to leave, we are scared to move, we are hiding at the moment.We dont know what to do.

The best friends reportedly wanted to surprise their mums by going home before their scheduled collection time in Yakutia, Siberia, the world’s coldest inhabited region. But they were not prepared for the bone-chilling cold on their -minute walk. CCTV caught the moment they fled nursery into the treacherous conditions, unseen by teachers. They put on their coats and hats but neither of the girls was wearing gloves - even though one of them had mittens in her pockets. Now the pair are recovering from frostbite and hypothermia after being out in a temperature C colder than ever recorded in Britain.   One of the children, named as Lena, remains in hospital as doctors battle to save her three frostbitten fingers. She had ended up forcing her way into a house and begging for help, after her unnamed friend got lost in the remote Namtsy village. Her friend was found one hour later, reported The Siberian Times.   Lenas mother said: “Three of her fingers froze hard. “She is crying. The children are still in shock.” The mother arrived early at pm to pick up Lena and found her coat missing. “We all started to panic,” she said. Then our grandfather called and said that Lena had just come home alone, all in tears, frozen.”The mother explained: “The girls decided to give their parents a surprise and come home by themselves.”  They certainly gave them a surprise - but there is now relief that the children are safe. Lenas mum added: Lena had mittens in her pocket - but she did not wear them.” An investigation is underway into how the girls managed to leave the nursery without anyone noticing. There is also concern that passersby did not stop the girls, although one helped one of the girls tie her scarf.

As the passengers genitals were now exposed, one of my colleagues brought a blanket, which I used to cover his modesty.

Elena Karimova also bought lighter fuel before allegedly strangling her daughter, Khadizha, four, and son Suleiman, two, in the back seat of her rented Kia Rio car. It is claimed she then set their bodies on fire and buried them in woodland. The -year-old, from Russia, who has , followers on her Instagram cosmetics business, was detained on murder charges nine months ago. The case is set to go to court in the coming months. Today, CCTV video was released of Karimova at a filling station purchasing petrol, a Snickers bar and barbecue lighter fuel.   She can be seen calming walking back to her hired car — where her two children are inside — to fill up with fuel before ing to collect the items which she is seen carrying as she gets back into her car. An hour or so afterwards she parked the car and strangled her children, it is alleged. It is claimed she took the bodies into woodland and used the lighter fuel to incinerate their bodies.   But Karimova, from Nizhny Novgorod, feared locals would see the smoke, so used water to extinguish the flames on their burning bodies, and put the charred remains into her car, say state investigators. Karimova went home for the night with the bodies in the car, it is alleged. The next day, its claimed, on  April, she brought the burned corpses to an abandoned warehouse near the city and set fire to the building.   Firefighters initially found what appeared to be one severely burned body after extinguishing the blaze. “The fireman initially thought that the charred corpse belonged to a dog,” said local resident Evgeny Katyshev. But when he came up closer, he realised these was the bodies of two children. “They were in unnatural poses, and rumours spread that they had been transported in a suitcase.   “The bodies were so damaged only one leg remained, and it was impossible to identy the gender of the corpses.” People noticed Karimovas car at the scene and police interrogated her leading to her full confession, say detectives. “I couldn’t provide for my children,” its claimed she told officers, blaming money problems for her actions. But she later retracted her admission that she had murdered her children.   In her original court appearance she had acknowledged that she killed them saying: “Im very sorry for what happened. I do not even know how I could go about this.” She added: “I lived with my husband, and then we orced and it became dficult to raise children.” Despite her financial problems, she spent pound a month on car rentals and went on holidays, its claimed. Shocked family members and friends said her action was “totally out of character” and refused to believe she was capable of such barbarity.   The man who rented her the car provided evidence to police that she had been responsible for the crimes, according to the Russian Investigative Committee which brought the criminal case against the mother. The committee insist that she had no accomplices. She underwent psychiatric tests and was found to be sane, say law enforcement officials. After releasing the video, a key part of the case against her, the committee said: CCTV cameras at a filling station recorded on the day of the murder as a -year-old resident of Nizhny Novgorod filled the tank of a rented car, and also bought lighter fuel, and for children, who were in the car, the last chocolate bar of their lives.”   Karimovas mother Natalia Testenkova said after the murder: “We do not believe this. “She is the most loving mother. How could she kill her kids  “We do not know what has happened, but we do not believe these are her kids that were found.” But the investigation found they were her children, say law enforcement.   Her godmother Valentina Butnar said Karimova had been in a “good mood” shortly before her children were killed. “I just cannot believe this is true,” she said. Two weeks before the alleged double murder the mother wrote on the birthday card of her daughter: You are my soul, my dearest little one, my long-awaited daughter…. “The one I live for.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly. It was scrappy but one good ball and one good header and it’s a good day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c41d925525d28.88073341.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds sam stanton does not want to experience another scottish cup shock","story":"Sam Stanton has been on both ends of cup shocks in his time, and it’s the feeling when he was on the wrong end of one that makes him determined to make sure Dundee United win their fourth-round tie against Montrose.As a Hibs player, Stanton was part of the side that made an unexpected exit at the hands of Raith Rovers.That painful memory is one he does not want to experience again.“I’ve actually had good and bad in the cup and, hopefully, this can be another good memory,” said the midfielder.“When I was at Dumbarton, we had a couple of games where we weren’t expected to win and did, so that was a nice feeling.“But, when I was at Hibs, we were beaten by Raith and that definitely wasn’t a nice experience.“They were in the Championship and we were in the Premier League, so everyone expected us to get through.

It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

","title":"ewan gurr the three js dundee is now all about the three ps poverty politics and people","story":"“I cannae wait to get oot o’ this s********” was a riposte I often used to hear from the natives of Dundee growing up here in the s.By , , people were leaving the city each year to pursue opportunities anywhere but here so it is quite the juxtaposition to now be listed among the Wall Street Journal’s Top  “hot destinations” and described by GQ magazine as “the coolest little city in Britain”.Jute, jam and journalism were the three recognised pillars of Dundee’s industrial heritage.The last five decades, however, have seen our other big cities set out their stall to secure a stake in Scotland’s future.Edinburgh is revered as our country’s capital, Glasgow as the city of culture and Aberdeen as the commercial centrepiece – but where does Dundee fit into this emerging mosaic There has been an implicit sense that the deindustrialisation of Dundee had left our city behind.At its height, the jute industry employed more than % of the working population of the city before the jobs were exported to India and the last mill closed in .Then, Mackay’s jam moved from its roots on the edge of Dundee’s east end to Arbroath, taking several hundred jobs with it, more than a decade ago.Last year, my family went to the Beano exhibition at The McManus across from the headquarters of DC Thomson, which is home to the one final pillar that is holding up our historical heritage.The exhibition featured a portrait of Sir John Leng, who wanted to create an affordable paper for the working classes.In , the first edition of the Eveningwas printed and retailed for the modest cost of half a penny.There are three other words which now come to mind when I think of Dundee: poverty, politics and people.Poverty moved in like an unwelcome lodger just as soon as jute vacated the city.Politics became a mechanism for the working classes to amply their unheard voices.And, though manufacturing industries have come and gone, Dundee’s finest commodity has always been its people, who are the true leblood.There is little doubt these three Ps are stitched together by the working classes.More than  years on from the birth of “the Tully” and there is as strong a need for a working class voice as ever.It is a voice that is currently absent in our press and our politics.This is one of the few remaining papers you can purchase for less than £ with access to writers who live in slums, rather than suburbs, and a political perspective from people who know more about poverty than prosperity.The working-class people of Dundee are the incarnation of the warmth that makes it such a “hot destination” and as our city sheds the dead skin of austerity in pursuit of a future marked by prosperity, it is high time that we maximise the marginalised voices of those who, as political activist Arundhati Roy once said, are not voiceless but just preferably unheard."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c45bcf1d6b1f8.61488205.jpg ","title":"excitement for dundees first ever trans pride event","story":"Dundee

long-serving players – Dennis Gillespie and Doug Smith being the others.“All of them were outstanding club men, and great examples for our young players.”The Dundee United directors also showed their

needs after school at the halls of the Mains Parish Church on Claverhouse Road for  years.However, its future was cast into doubt last year when the Church of Scotland announced plans to sell up.But thanks to a local benefactor, Spectrum has secured the church halls for good.Kirsty Anderson, chairwoman of Spectrum’s board, said the open day next Saturday was a chance for her and her staff to thank locals for their help.“Friends, families, residents, businesses, former parents – anyone that has helped us over the years is welcome,” she said.On the open day, which runs from noon-pm with a grand opening at .pm, locals will be able to see what Spectrum does to support children with autism day in, day out.Stalls will be set up offering information on autism, as well as how to access other services across the region.“I don’t think people realise how much work goes on behind the scenes to make this place run,” said manager Lori Clark.“It’s not just the building – it’s us driving autism awareness.”Spectrum was started in  by local parents to promote the wellbeing of children with disorders on the autistic spectrum and has been based on Claverhouse Road since .After the Church of Scotland revealed its plans to sell, the charity scrambled to find a new home.However, the generosity of late local woman Margaret Craig, who left a substantial sum in her will to support autism services, helped it to buy the halls.Margaret’s husband John is the father-in-law of Derek McDonough, a former treasurer with the charity.With Margaret’s only instruction being to use the money to support autism causes, John visited Spectrum while it was still looking for a new home – and elected to give it a boost.Lori added: “Derek has been so supportive – both him and his we Beth are probably our biggest supporters.“John came and saw what we did and he liked it so he thought it was a good use for Margaret’s money.”Other local support has come from Tesco, whose community team helped repaint, and kitchen wholesaler Houdens which supplied a complete kitchen free of charge.Local joiner Grant Sampson, of G Samson Contracts Ltd, installed the kitchen without charging a penny.Other help given to the charity, however, is tinged with sadness.Local business JR Man  Van came by in recent days to pick up equipment which had been damaged beyond repair by thoughtless vandals.The charity has examined the possibility of CCTV to prevent it happening again – but it is beyond its budget at this time.Lori added: “People have been going the extra mile for us, putting in their own time after what happened.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c45bbd46a9d95.54576897.jpg ","title":"world class artists like sir tom jones are talking about dundees slessor gardens","story":"Music icon Sir Tom Jones will play in Dundee this summer when he sets foot on the Green, Green Grass of Slessor Gardens.The Welsh legend will belt out classics like She’s A Lady, Delilah, and What’s New Pussycat when he takes to the stage on Saturday July .The concert has been put on by promoters the Liz Hobbs Group and promises to be a memorable night for Dundee.Liz Doogan-Hobbs, chief executive of promoters LHG Live, said Sir Tom is a performer she has been keen to bring to Dundee for some time.She said: “We are delighted to be working with Tom Jones once again.“He remains one of the most popular artists in the industry and truly captivates his fans whenever he takes to the stage.“I have been trying to bring him to Dundee since we started doing concerts in Slessor Gardens three years ago but this is the first time the dates have worked out.“He was one of the first names I put on my list to bring here and I’m delighted that he will now perform in Dundee this summer.“Dundee is a vibrant place and we are certain that the concert is going to be greatly welcomed in the city, promising an evening filled with Tom’s most recognisable and popular hits.“We are looking forward to seeing all his fans there.”Sir Tom isn’t the first big name to perform at Slessor Gardens in recent years, with the likes of Little Mix, Simple Minds and Primal Scream among others taking to the stage.Craig David is also pencilled in for this year as top acts make their way north of the border.Liz reckons more and more big name acts will see Dundee as an attractive proposition in the months and years to come as the city continues to grow.And she believes word is already getting out about the Slessor Gardens venue.Liz added: “Dundee is really beginning to earn itself a fantastic international reputation for everything that is going on in the city.“World class artists like Sir Tom are talking about Slessor Gardens.“They are asking about the venue and word is spreading that it is a great place to perform.”Tickets for the Tom Jones concert go on sale on Friday at am.Standing tickets cost £., £ and £.There is a booking fee for all tickets, which are available from tomjones, ticketmaster and lhgtickets."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"lunar-eclipse-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-natural-phenomenon","story":"GLASWEGIAN astronomers and skygazers will be on the look out for a lunar spectacle on Monday morning as a total lunar eclipse takes place."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-glasgow-city-council-to-sell-assets-to-its-own-property-firm-to-fund-500m-deal","story":"Glasgow City Council will sell off valuable assets to its own property company - then pay to lease them back to fund the equal pay settlement."},{"url":null,"title":"how-celtic-rated-in-scottish-cup-win-over-airdrie","story":"BAIN: Took the gloves from Craig Gordon for the Cup run.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"busy ayr gym wants create","story":"NewsBusy Ayr gym wants to create new spaBannatyne’s in Whitletts has lodged plans for a single storey extension to its Highfield Drive club.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsBannatyne’s in Whitletts has lodged plans for a new spa\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA busy gym wants to create a new spa.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"we-want-to-make-innerleithen-the-european-mountain-bike-capital","story":"A DATE has been set for driving forward plans to turn Innerleithen into

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside. She said: \"There is so much fear about Alabama rot because not much is known about it. Its impossible to say where Georgie got it, she could have picked it up anywhere.\"We still walk by the river most days, we arent scared to walk there but I do make sure I get the mud off after.\"\"My advice to other dog owners is to be aware and on the lookout for sores on your dog.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mammoth-catch-at-this-years-selkirk-haggis-hunt","story":"MORE than  hunters headed onto Selkirk Hill at the weekend in search of the illusive haggis.And, as was forecast by organisers, they ed with a record catch.Glorious sunshine and crisp footing made for an excellent mornings sport.And for the first time in the historic huntrsquos history, woolly mammoth haggi were caught on the breeding grounds.Dave Scott from the organising committee told us: ldquoThe woolly mammoth haggi is an ancient strain of our beloved creature and they were plentul in Selkirk for the first time this year.ldquoFor decades it was thought they were extinct, but we have noticed more and more of these large colourful haggi here in Selkirk when weve been doing our inspections.\"There was a fear that theyd be like grey squirrels and scare away the smaller indigenous haggi but they all seem to live happily together.\"Were not sure why they migrated to Selkirk Hill but were happy to have them.ldquoEvery year there are more and more hunters but we are lucky having such tremendous breeding grounds that our haggis numbers remain fairly solid.As has become customary over the decades, the hunters were piped from the Market Place at .am.And, as superstition insists, the Haggis Polka was danced outside the Argus Centre to bring luck.Matthew Burgess, who took over as head huntsman from his late father Bob, made sure the strict rules were adhered to before toasting the haggis on competition of the dayrsquos sport.Mr Burgess told us: ldquoThere can be few better sights than  tartan clad hunters marching towards Selkirk Hill.ldquoOur forefathers maintained this wonderful tradition even when haggis was scarce, and their hard work has meant that today the next generation will never go hungry on Burns Night.Experts, many with with red noses, within the Townrsquos Arms hunt headquarters weighed in more than  haggi on Sunday afternoon ndash including more than  of the recently discovered woolly mammoth strain.Townrsquos Arms mine host Louise Stephen, who provided the pre- and post-hunt whisky toast, was delighted with the dayrsquos sport.She said: ldquoFewany left the hill without a catch.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-glasgow-city-council-to-sell-assets-to-its-own-property-firm-to-fund-500m-deal","story":"The council last week agreed a deal to settle the claims of around , women with a final bill in the region of pound million.The cash-strapped council has been investigating how best to raise the cash and using key city assets has emerged as the main option to provide the bulk of the cashIt would mean selling buildings like leisure centres and the Royal Concert Hall and the Emirates Arena built for the  Commonwealth Games to City Property.Historic and architecturally important buildings like the City Chambers and Kelvingrove Museum would be excluded from any deal.:Glasgow City Council confirms poundm equal-pay settlementCity Property, which is wholly owned by the council, would borrow cash from the lending market to purchase the buildings from the council, providing most of the cash to settle the claims.Then the council would lease the buildings back and pay the cost of the City Property borrowing, probably be over  to  years.A spokesman said: ldquoWork on a financial strategy to meet the cost of settling equal pay has been ongoing, in parallel with negotiations, for a number of months.ldquoThe council has previously acknowledged this will involve making best-use of the cityrsquos assets over a number of years to support borrowing.ldquoDetailed proposals will be put before committee for approval in the near future.Women were celebrating last week when the council, unions and lawyers representing claimants announced they a had reached agreement on terms of a settlement.The lawyer, Stefan Cross, who has taken forward thousands of the claims however said it will take months before offers are sent out and then more time before cash is in their bank accounts.:Equal pay agreement is just the beginning of the end for GlasgowThe long-running sage came to a conclusion after years of the council under the previous Labour administration challenging court rulings.Susan Aitken, SNP council leader said she would settle the cases and had the council agree to ending the legal challenge and work towards negotiating a deal.However, there was still a bitter dispute which culminated in strike action towards the end of last year.Meanwhile, Greens have warned that the cost of settling claims canrsquot be used to justy cuts to services."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-for-all-our-sakes-four-facts-about-the-snp-that-we-can-all-hopefully-agree-on","story":":Alex Salmond takes swipe at SNP leadership over IndyrefSo, in the spirit of trying to encourage more facts in a post-fact world, could I offer you four which I think we can rely on  I realise, of course, that some people will immediately look at my list and say theyrsquore not facts at all, theyrsquore opinion, but all I can say is that this is a genuine effort to distil the last few days of argument over the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and the Alex Salmond investigation into four areas where I think most of us could find agreement. Here goes.The first one is this: the Salmond investigation is unlikely to change many minds on independence, which is where Walter Macfarlane comes in. Walter, I should explain, has been dead for  years but I only came across him for the first time a few days ago while I was reading the journals of the great Scottish diarist James Boswell. Boswell writes about meeting Macfarlane in the entry for Sunday  November  and describes him as a man who was ldquokeenly interested in the reigning contests between Scots  English.:Poll suggests SNPs credibility damaged by Alex Salmond allegationsldquoHe talked much against the Union, writes Boswell of his new friend. ldquoHe said we were perfect underlings, that our riches were carried out of the country, that no town but Glasgow had any advantage of trade by it, and that many others were hurt by it.Why am I bringing this up now  Mainly because it demonstrates something thatrsquos often forgotten, which is that unhappiness with the Union and support for independence is not a modern phenomenon, and itrsquos not all about the SNP either. As you can see from Boswellrsquos diary, Macfarlane was complaining about the Union just  years or so after the Act of Parliament that brought it about and  years before the SNP was even thought of. Which is the important point: independence has always been a strand of Scottish opinion and, seen in that long historical context, the travails of Nicola Sturgeonare unlikely to greatly change that one way or the other.The second fact is this: the Salmond investigation has emphasised that there are serious isions in the SNP. Some nationalists appear to be offended by this idea and deny there is any ision at all but the briefings of Salmond supporters against Sturgeon and vice versa speak for themselves. In fact, even as he made an apparent appeal to end the acrimony at the weekend, Alex Salmond couldnrsquot resist turning his handshake into a punch. He said he had ordered his team not to become involved in any more exchanges before criticising Sturgeon for not concentrating on independence. There may be some in the SNP who insist this doesnrsquot represent ision but then Baghdad Bob insisted there were no American troops in Iraq to the sound of American troops in Iraq.The third fact leads straight on from the ision in the SNP but is about nationalism more generally and itrsquos this: levels of support for both sides of the independence debate have not shted.In some ways, this third fact is the most surprising of all because, on the face of it, the circumstances are in place for a breakthrough on either side. For the opposition parties at Holyrood, therersquos the Salmond investigation and its implications for Sturgeon and yet support for the SNP has not changed, and for the nationalists, therersquos the crisis of Brexit and yet the polls continue to show  per cent of Scots want to remain in the UK. The nationalists may talk about a ldquosurge and the unionists may revel in the SNPrsquos crisis, but the polls havenrsquot changed. Thatrsquos a fact.Which leads us to the fourth, final, and perhaps most controversial fact: a second referendum on Scottish independence before  is less likely than it was two years ago. Partly, this is because of those polls againbut itrsquos also because of the logistics and timing. The reality now is that we may not know ndash even by  ndash what Brexit is going to look like and Sturgeon herself has said there will be no announcement until the fog has cleared. Then therersquos the clincher: there is no prospect of a Section  order giving permission for a referendum from the Conservative Government. Thatrsquos a fact many of those in the independence movement simply pretend does not exist.:Calls for public inquiry into \"unlawful\" handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Alex SalmondThe effect of all of these facts, as Irsquove confidently called them, is another matter entirely and depends on how much the politicians resist them. In the wake of the Salmond investigation, itrsquos certainly hard to imagine the SNP fighting the  election campaign with any of the confidence it had in  and , and even in , but then again therersquos every chance Nicola Sturgeon will stick to the grid and announce a referendum before  in the hope that its rejection by the UK Government will increase support for her position.Should that happen, I have honestly no ideathe strategy would work ndash the facts donrsquot stretch that far ndash but maybe now would be a good time toto the diaries of James Boswell for some insight from the past.Writing on  December , just a few days after his meeting with Walter Macfarlane, Boswell got to thinking about the upheavals caused by unrest and war. He did not much care for the quarrels of Mankind when ided into particular states and nations, he wrote, but he could see that they depended not on facts but on the frailties of humans. ldquoI can see that Great People, those who manage the fates of Kingdoms, he said, ldquoare just such beings as myself."},{"url":null,"title":"loch-fleet-freezes-over-as-temperatures-drop-across-scotland","story":"Yet, as the North Sea froze as it fed into Loch Fleet in Sutherland between Dornoch and Golspie, where the Met Office recorded temperatures of -degCand -degCon respective nights, it betrayed how cold Scotland is right now.To chill the spirits further this Blue Monday, forecasters warn worse is very much on the way.:Cold weather lsquohere to stayrsquo with disruptive snow possible, say forecastersTonightrsquos evening rush hour is already forecast to be a miserable affair, with gales in the north, snow on high ground and torrential rain in the Central Belt.Transport networks, particularly west coast ferries, are likely to be disrupted.Luke Miall, of the Met Office, said: ldquoItrsquos Blue Monday and the temperature maps look pretty blue, too.

Ghost, known by its registration plate AX , was built by Rolls-Royce in  and soon earned global fame for its quietness, luxuriousness and price.It is considered something of a holy grail among enthusiasts and is thought to be the most valuable motor in the world, with an insured value of pound million.Last year, Rolls-Royce launched a new, limited edition car to commemorate the history of AX , named the Silver Ghost Collection.Just  were produced and are on sale for hundreds of thousands of pounds.But a curious fact about the carrsquos famous Spirit Of Ecstasy hood ornament has come to light almost a year after it first launched ndash and one that Rolls-Royce has not even advertised to the public.The bottom of the statue on the bonnet of the  Silver Ghost Collection models contains a small copper ingot, marked with the AX  insignia of the original car.Rolls-Royce enthusiast Ruth Blair has revealed the copper is, in fact, taken from a pipe on the original  car that has been melted down and placed on to the  model in homage to the Silver Ghost.Mrs Blair, a charity fundraiser who has a farm near Cumbernauld, said she acquired copper from the original Silver Ghost after it was reconditioned in  by Rolls-Royce heritage experts Paul and Andy Wood.The brothers replaced some copper piping from the engine bay of AX  and ious steel components, and kept them for  years, waiting for an appropriate way to use them.In  they gave the metal to Mrs Blair, who at the time was creating a miniature Rolls-Royce for children that she eventually sold to raise money for charity.Realising the immense value of the parts, she sold them back to Rolls-Royce in  for an undisclosed amount of money and suggested the manufacturer create a limited edition tribute car to its most famous model.The company then commissioned  cars and has sent them all over the world to be sold to wealthy collectors, investors and enthusiasts.Last night, a sales representative of the Leven Car Company said the source of the ingot was kept a secret until salesmen could be sure a potential buyer was serious about purchasing the car.Details of the car were also kept out of the public domain to protect the Rolls-Royce brand.A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said: ldquoThirty-fiveof the extraordinary and exceptional Silver Ghost Collection have been created by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.ldquoInidually, as customers purchase these cars, they are intrigued to discover the provenance of the small copper ingot at the foot of the Spirit Of Ecstasy, and are surprised and delighted at its origins.After researching the car on its release last year, Mrs Blair realised the company had not advertised that the copper at the base of its hood ornament had come from the original AX .She told The Herald she acquired and then sold the copper from the Silver Ghost, and that it had been kept a secret from Rolls-Roycersquos own potential customers.Her husband, John Blair, who is a former car salesman, travelled to the Rolls-Royce factory at Goodwood, West Sussex, while the cars were being manufactured.He learned that even the engineers working on the Silver Ghost collectionrsquos construction had not been told by the companyrsquos executives where the materials had come from.To practise creating a copper ingot, and not wishing to use the precious century-old copper, Rolls-Royce bought some of the material from a local scrapyard to create a prototype of what would become the limited edition Spirit of Ecstasy, she said.Now only one of the cars remains in the UK, at the Leven Car Company in Edinburgh.Mrs Blair still owns steel wheel assembly nuts, coach bolts and a starting handle spring from the Silver Ghost.And she says she is looking for a partner who may be able to help her rework or redevelop them.ldquoI originally gave them all the parts ndash the steel and the copper ndash and they gave me the steel parts back, she said.ldquoJohn took the parts down

time made up a vanishingly small proportion of the worldrsquos whisky market, was championed by curators who wanted to develop unique flavours.The firm now has a huge collection of whiskies from historic and long-closed distilleries that it occasionally bottles and puts on the market.Now, after  years of maturing a whisky from the Glen Grant distillery, Gordon  MacPhail has uncorked the barrel and is selling bottles to customers for pound, each.For Stephen Rankin, director of prestige, whose great-grandfather John Urquhart selected the whisky for the company collection on June , , tasting Glen Grant for the first time is an ldquoemotional experience.He tried a dram from the cask with his cousin, who also works for the company.ldquoIn a nutshell, itrsquos incredibly smooth, incredibly mellow, but itrsquos got a huge amount of character and flavour, he says.ldquoWhen you drink something of this sort of age, it takes you back in time to things that were going on back then, in .ldquoYoursquore thinking about the Geneva Convention, which was to come out not long after that. It was years before we started putting men in space, and while ious things have happened, this whisky has quietly matured throughout all of that.Gordon  MacPhail competed with blended whiskies from labels such as Johnnie Walker and Chivas Regal in an approach that was considered eccentric at the time. The company refers to itself as a ldquocurator and creator,not a distiller.Mr Rankin describes the Glen Grant as having a dizzying array of flavours, including vanilla fudge, strawberries, raspberries, white stone fruit, orange peel, cinnamon, mahogany, mint and cardamom.It began le as spirit, produced by the Glen Grant distillery in Rothes, near Elgin. At the time, the distillery would have used traditional whisky-making practices and burned peat as fuel in its distillery.Gordon  MacPhail, located in Elgin, bought a cask of the spirit and began to mature it in a cask that had transported sherry from Spain. As the spirit matured into whisky, it borrowed the other spiritrsquos flavours, left over in the wood of the barrel.For the next  years, the cask stayed with the company, being checked regularly by members of the Urquhart family to measure the rate of maturation and the impact of the wood on the spirit.Last October, the family finally decided the whisky had reached its ideal maturity, and has produced  bottles from the -litre cask to be sold as part of its Private Collection range.The Private Collection is a selection of whiskies chosen by members of the Urquhart family from closed or little-known distilleries, which sell for huge amounts of money.It has a collection of whisky from  distilleries in Scotland, of which  no longer exist.Last year, a bottle of the companyrsquos  Glenlivet whisky sold at auction for more than pound,.The Glen Grant is bottled at the cask strength of . per cent in a hand-blown crystal decanter and will be sold on the market for pound,.Mr Rankin says there are three types of people who typically pay thousands for a bottle: collectors, investors, and what he calls the ldquoRegular Joes, for whom the history of a whisky and its rare flavours prove too much to resist.ldquoItrsquos like an antique, he says. ldquoIt cannot be recreated. You cannot go back to the s to remake this, and whisky back then was made dferently. People want to try things the way it was. Wersquove had regular people who probably live in suburbia, for example, but the story of the whisky will touch them on a level you canrsquot understand, because itrsquos personal to them.ldquoIt might be when their mother or father was born, or when their business was started, or when they were born. Therersquos lots of emotional tie-ins.For Mr Rankin, the emotion of drinking the  spirit comes from knowing it is members of his own family that have looked after the cask for decades.He said: ldquoMy grandfather George would have had a signicant role in the selection of whiskies, and he would have done this overseen by his father. He would then have passed on the skills to analyse and check maturing whisky to his children. All that knowledge and history has been passed down to us."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-lets-give-power-to-the-people-through-citizens-assemblies","story":"The current political system will never give ordinary people control. Did an X on a ballot paper ever create the change you really want  Politics has failed across the west. To apply the word ldquouseless to politicians of all stripes is to be kind. But systems can be reformed, even the rotten stagnant ones in the UK ndash and the national disaster thatrsquos Brexit could be the catalyst for change.The issue of a Citizensrsquo Assembly, as a means to resolve the Brexit crisis, is now moving on to the stage ndash andwe go for it,we truly give power to the people through Citizensrsquo Assemblies, then we could transform our dying democracy into the most vibrant democracy on Earth.Citizensrsquo Assemblies are about ordinary people ndash you and I ndash honestly informing the thinking of other ordinary people without the involvement of any politician whatsoever.If yoursquore a little unclear about what a Citizensrsquo Assembly does, then look to the west and see what Ireland has been doing of late ndash a country which has transformed itself into one of the few healthy democracies in Europe with an engaged and informed electorate.In , Ireland knew it had to deal with the issue of abortion. A previous referendum more than  years before had been ugly and isive. So, Ireland looked back to the founders of democracy in ancient Athens and experimented with a Citizensrsquo Assembly ndash giving real say to the people, allowing ordinary voters to shape the debate.Some  randomly-selected Irish citizens, with a back-up team of another  in case of drop-outs or sickness, were chosen to become what amounted to a jury on abortion. Like a jury they were meant to be representative of the population in terms of age, sex, class and geography. They were chaired by a judge, had staff attached to them to take notes and give advice ndash effectively their own civil service ndash and they met every weekend for  months to hear evidence and discuss abortion, and four other topics. The  were split into smaller groups so they could interrogate evidence and witnesses in microscopic detail.Citizen Assembly members could call anyone they liked to speak to them. On the issue of abortion there were , submissions and they heard from every shade of opinion. The hearings were public and streamed live online, so every nuanced piece of evidence, every statistic, every medical fact and figure was relayed to Irelandrsquos . million citizens as the assembly heard submissions.As on a jury, it is hard under such circumstances to keep your mind closed, or to fall back on your beliefs rather than what the evidence of your eyes and ears is telling you. Hard-working facts will defeat lazy opinion.Politicians in elections and referendums do not try to convince us with detail and evidence ndash they play fast and loose with the truth, and they manipulate our prejudices and emotions. Politicians want us to be uninformed as then we can be swayed ndash as Brexit showed, with a bewildered, confused electorate making choices to leave or remain based on their gut and their heart, not their mind and the facts.In , after their long deliberations, the Irish Citizensrsquo Assembly members voted ndash and  per cent recommended that the Dail allow abortion in Ireland. It was asthe tide went out and never came back in again. It marked a sea-change in Ireland. The facts ndash the truth ndash had been pored over in minute detail and when the national referendum campaign on abortion began no-one could get away with a cheap lie, or a manipulative advert as the public had been informed.In the end, Ireland approved abortion by  to . The idea of a deferential Ireland tagging along behind the Catholic Church was dead, and the nation stepped forward as a progressive, clever, flexible and informed democracy ndash one that Britain with its tarnished travesty of a democracy should envy.It isnrsquot just Ireland where Citizensrsquo Assemblies have been tested. In the Netherlands, an assembly looked at ndash and recommended ndash electoral reform in Japan, it was nuclear power in Poland, they looked at flood prevention and migration Texas used one on energy Canada for health.Citizensrsquo Assemblies would transform our adversarial democracy into a deliberative democracy, one in which thought, consideration and consensus are the brokers, not lies. The worst elements of populism would be leashed ndash as who could say, when it came to the big issues, that power did not lie with the people. In this age of unreason, we would start to restore truth fake news would be fought with fact.Citizensrsquo Assemblies would also restore that most important part of democracy ndash compromise, something which we have lost. Without compromise there can be no democracy, only the tyranny of the majority.Citizensrsquo Assemblies could unlock a peaceful non-isive path by which we could resolve our most intractable problems. For a start, we could reform our defunct UK-wide voting system which keeps two Jurassic parties in power and smothers new, interesting and representative voices.A Citizensrsquo Assembly on Climate Change would silence forever the nonsense of climate denial ndash in a forum of facts, the climate deniers would be reduced to the status of flat-earthers. And surely, a Citizensrsquo Assembly here in Scotland on the question of independence would allow the people to truly get to grips with the issues that were puppeteered by Better Together and the Yes campaign last time around. What is the truth about the economy  What are the facts about Europe  About oil  About Trident  About pensions, tax, welfare  As a Yes voter, I thought I was right when I cast my ballot for independence ndash but was I, or was I working on gut and spin Why not permanent, rolling Citizensrsquo Assemblies on tax, health, poverty, education, prisons, policing, defence We live in semi-darkness at the moment. Politicians keep facts and truth in the shadows so they benefit, not us. But sunlight is the best disinfectant.Read more: Ireland votes on abortion"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-our-mps-must-now-unite-to-act-in-the-best-interests-of-the-people","story":"This is of course the same Dr Fox who blithely predicted that ldquothe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. Such rash statements and empty promises from Brexiters really do need to be robustly challenged. It would be very interesting to know how many \"free trade\" deals with other countries Dr Fox has secured since the  Referendum Are we really to believe that the UK will be able to secure better trade deals with these countries than the ones that we already enjoy as members of the EU  This is just one example of the nonsense that we are expected to take on board from the Brexiters.Dr Fox knows very well that we live in a representative democracy where our Members of Parliament are given the responsibility of acting in the best interests of the country. The Brexit referendum was purely advisory and while Parliament voted to honour the narrow decision to leave the EU, clearly circumstances have changed dramatically. The full costs of our departure from the EU are becoming ever more apparent. We have the extraordinary situation where our leaders from finance, business, manufacturing, transport, the NHS, the hospitality industry, the academic world have united to warn that our country is facing perhaps years of depression. This stark analysis is confirmed by the Governmentrsquos own projections. None of the ious options being touted round will leave the UK in a stronger position than we are just now as members of the EU. With Parliament so hopelessly ided, the decision has to be given back to the people.Hopefully our MPs will not behave like their counterparts in Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe and leave \"that brain outside and vote just as their leaders tell lsquoem to\" but rather unite to act in the best interests of the people that they have been elected to represent and serve.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN , as a naive \"Wilsonista\", I voted to remain in the European Economic Community . I was too ill-informed thento realise that the EEC was the first big step towards the political union of Europe. Then, the political and media \"sophisticates\"deliberately concealed the trajectory towards an end-state of European political union now, the elites patronise and sneer at the working class who do not share their bourgeois superior vision and moral virtue on the EU.In the s , I came to realise that I did not want a European superstate dominated by France and Germany, supported by a payroll vote of smaller nations, and funded disproportionately by the British taxpayer. I was against joining the euro, because a monetary union cannot work without a banking union, a debt union, a fiscal union and a political union. Accordingly, the single currency and its dogged maintenance has bankrupted Greece, brought Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland to the brink of economic disaster, and impoverished millions by unemployment. Even Germanyis teetering on the edge of recession. Yet those European countries not in the euro, but having their own flexible currency exchange rates , create jobs and \"do alright\".Furthermore, and after events in the s in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia , Kosovo, and, more recently, Ukraine, it has not been the EU, but Nato, that has stabilised peace in Europe with British and American interventions.Yet, despite the evidence above, Remainers inside and outside Parliament press on to keep the UK in the EU. But they cannot convince voters of the benefits of the customs union and the common external tarf, the single market, the \"common rule-book\", the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. Remainers may well succeed in destroying a real Brexit on WTO unilateral free trade terms ndash what they call \"crashing out\", \"no deal\" ndash and imply the abrupt end of trade between the UK and the EU . All Remainers have to do is persuade Parliament to rescind Article  or to extend it beyond the scheduled departure date of March .No doubt, as \"good Europeans\", Remainers would then expect the UK to participate in the European Parliament election on May . Would that election not constitute a second EU referendum  Would they not get hammeredby \"Tell them again Vote Leave\" candidates  Would they then demand a third referendum Richard Mowbray, Ancaster Drive, Glasgow.I GATHER that there are a group of hardcore Remain supporters who are rejoicing at the prospect of the \"Deatherendum\", the process by which the passing of senescent old doddererslike me, who had the effrontery prejudices to vote Leave in the  referendum, removes us from the Electoral Register, our places being taken by a cohort of youngsters, whose enthusiastic, uncritical acclaim of the glorious European superstate would sweep Remain to a convincing victory in any subsequent poll.While it is true that a disproportionate number of older voters tended to vote Leave , the overall narrowness of the Leave victory would lead me to suspect that a substantial number of SODs voted Remain. So unless these Remainers can precisely control where the Grim Reapers scythe swings, they had better be careful for what they wish.In the meantime,its not too late, I will be paying a bit more

for the French version of the  graphic book Asterix and the Picts to be used in primary schools as a language resource.The move is part of a wider initiative between the university and curriculum body Education Scotland to produce a range of new online teaching materials based on academic research.A total of  resources have been created for pupils in primary and the first three years of secondary school, including the history of the Vikings in Scotland, political songs and poems and medieval history.In addition, Polish films will also be used as a language resource while pupils can learn about the hundreds of Scots words used to describe snow.Other topics focus on prehistoric monuments in urban areas, the art of storytelling in computer games and le in high rise blocks of flats.The resources all take dferent forms, but generally consist of materials such as lesson plans, slide shows, workbooks, edited texts, audio files, videos and pictures or photographs.Laurence Grove, Professor of French Text and Image Studies at the university, who help secure the copyrite to allow the Asterix book to be used, said the familiar characters were an ideal way to engage pupils.He said: ldquoAsterix is the worldrsquos biggest-selling book series because generations of children have been drawn into the stories.ldquoThese books encapsulate a lot of human character, but they are also fun which means children will learn more about the French language.Launching the resources at Glasgow University, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he hoped other universities would be inspired to work on school materials.He said: ldquoWhat most excites me is that we are bringing high quality research from academics together with the skills and knowledge of teachers to make really exciting resources for all.ldquoThe Asterix books were very much part of my childhood and it is lovely to see these stories and characters having such longevity and being used to inspire future generations.ldquoI was also fascinated by the topic on housing in high places, which is a real insight into th century Scotland and the improvement in the quality of le that high rise living meant for so many, but also how that concept did not deliver everything that people had hoped for.The collaboration, which started as a pilot in , is run by academics Professor Dauvit Broun and Dr Joanna Tucker and Lynne Robertson, from Education Scotland.Mr Broun, director of the universityrsquos ArtsLab, which supports research-led activities, said teachers and academics had produced original, creative and useful resources which could be used by any teacher in Scotland.He said: ldquoThe strength of this scheme is that it allows researchers to work with schools in a way that is truly collaborative, and produces resources which speak directly to the needs of those actually working in the classroom.ldquoWorking with school teachers has been extremely rewarding, since they approach the subjects in such a creative and open way, which challenges us researchers to rethink our own work.ldquoWhen designing this scheme, it was fundamental that the teachers be in the driving seat, steering what the resources would look like, since they have the real experience of what works in the classroom.Ms Tucker, arts and humanities innovation researcher, said the scheme was part of a new era where schools and universities would work together more closely.She added: ldquoAs university researchers our work does not always fit directly with the subjects taught and examined in schools.ldquoThe scheme demonstrates the common purpose of learning, regardless of whether it is in a primary classroom or a lecture theatre.Mrs Robertson said a group of senior education officers at Education Scotland had worked with the researchers to establish what would work best.She said: ldquoIt is our job to take a decision on what aspects within the research areas will work in schools.ldquoThen our role is to help the university recruit the teachers that would be the right fit to work with the academics.ldquoA good example is the medieval resource where we have created about  dferent topics which lets children explore more than just the traditional subjects of kings and queens or battles.ldquoThe kings and queens are there too and that is important, but this also allows them to explore the lives of ordinary people like them as well as what it would have been like to live at that time.Mrs Robertson said the flexibility within the resources was key to allowing teachers to chose what topics would engage their pupils, but everything included was backed up with high quality university research.The scheme is funded by the universityrsquos ArtsLab which supports research-led activities in the College of Arts.ArtsLab pays for the teachersrsquo time while Education Scotland provides support for the scheme by recruiting teachers and curating the resources

And when they , they have to speak to around , fellow pupils about their experiences.“We see them transform from painfully shy youngsters into young adults who are confident enough to lead the expedition.“Our pupils have gone on to study at university and be leaders in their fields.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks. Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection.

During that time, hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered their time providing the RSPB with over eight million hours of monitoring garden birds.This year’s event takes place on ,  and  January .The public is asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden or local green space, then send their results to the RSPB.Close to half-a-million people join in the Birdwatch every year and, in Aberdeenshire, the most commonly recorded bird last year was the house sparrow, followed by the starling, chaffinch, blackbird, blue tit, and goldfinch.Over the last  years,  million birds have been counted giving the RSPB an astonishing amount of insight into how our wildle is faring.Mike Clarke, RSPB Chief Executive, said: “Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildle. Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a signicant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades. Those taking part work together as part of a community with thousands of other Big Garden Birdwatchers to help the RSPB’s work to protect birds, other wildle and the places they live.“Reaching  years is a huge achievement and shows just how passionate people across the UK are about their wildle.The survey started as a winter activity for our youth members. It’s now the largest garden wildle survey in the world and appeals to both children and adults because it’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.” As well as counting birds, the RSPB is once again asking participants to log some of the other wildle they have seen throughout the year. This year, people are being asked to look out for badger, fox, grey squirrel, red squirrel, muntjac deer, roe deer, frog and toad.To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Set in , it sees protagonist Scott and his father James take the car ferry across the Beauly Firth to Inverness as they watch men working on the Kessock Bridge.Scott agrees to attend a farm roup with his father and feels he is being watched by a yellow eye from a dirty painting hanging amongst the lots. Unknown to his father, he successfully bids for it and his le starts to alter in remarkable ways.The action swings between Aberdeen and Florence as Scott embarks on a journey of discovery.Mr Herd, who describes himself as ldquo going on , said time spent alone working on so many films served him.He said: ldquoBy the nature of film work there wasnrsquot a typical day because all trips y. The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months. Being in a hide that long gives you plenty of time to think.ldquoLying awake in bed in the morning, plot ideas and characters nag at me and I have to get up to write about them.ldquoI am a hopeless two-fingered typist which is very frustrating because they canrsquot keep up with whatrsquos going through my head. That aside It does surprise me how easy it is for me to write, I donrsquot know where that comes from. I try to write at least a thousand words a day but quite often Irsquoll hit a brick wall.ldquoI donrsquot worry about that because I know that I will get the inspiration to carry on later.ldquoI try to write about what I know, itrsquos much more convincing and I use locations Irsquove been to. For example, in The Medusa Shield, Scott goes full moon night fishing off the Black Isle coast in a Zulu boat. While I was in India the fishermen on the east coast do that every month.The Medusa Shield is available from Amazon Kindle, Kobo and other digital publishers.Tuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group. Lizzie and the group will then create sketches from these conversations to use as prompts for the group to aid their design of the memory blanket.The programme is supported by the UK-wide DEEP project , and the blankets will be used at a DEEP gathering to be run at Evanton Woods in the spring.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month. According to Cllr Smith, garden users are ldquodevastated but adamant they wish to continue.She wants to see NHS Highland play a full role plotting the way forward, including carrying out self-directed supportassessments, a tool that aims to ensure people who are eligible for support are given the choice and control over how their inidual budget is arranged and delivered to meet their agreed health and social care outcomes.Tain-based Mike Herd, whose son has happily attended the scheme in Invergordon, said: ldquoNHS Highland made a commitment to me last year that they would try to help the garden project continue through a dferent funding formula. However, the reality is that letters asking for SDS funding have been ignored. It seems that NHS Highland have just abandoned the gardeners to a bleak futurelong-term funding cannot be agreed.Cllr Smith added: ldquoI make a plea, especially to big businesses locally, to contact me and offer some funding towards this worthwhile project that gives the adult users with learning disabilities pride and a reason to get up in the morning.ldquoIt is only a one-off payment I am seeking, not continual funding.NHS Highlandrsquos head of service for learning disabilities and autism, Arlene Johnstone, said: ldquoDue to financial pressures NHS Highland is no longer able to contribute funding to the Garden Project in Invergordon. However, we are supporting Councillor Maxine Smith in her efforts to find a new funding model and we have offered that,successful, they can continue to use the land in the grounds of the Isobel Rhind Centre.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home.

The committee said those councils which felt they had to charge should particularly consider access for those pupils least able to afford it.The inquiry came after many of Scotland’s councils introduced fees for musical instrument tuition or increased existing fees for students, which campaigners said made it unaffordable for many pupils.High-profile musicians including violinist Nicola Benedetti and Mick Cooke, trumpet player in indie band Belle and Sebastian, joined forces to campaign against the practice, which they said could have catastrophic consequences for Scotland’s music scene.The inquiry last year heard evidence from people affected by the charges, including music students who gave an impassioned plea for charges to be cut. One local authority had seen nearly  per cent of pupils receiving music tuition dropping out following the introduction of charges. Clackmannanshire council revealed in June that it was to double the cost of lessons to £ a year – or £. per half-hour class. Clare Adamson MSP, convenor of the education committee, said: “There is little doubt about the positive benefits that music can have on us as iniduals, as communities and indeed to the wider Scottish culture and economy. “However, for too many young people these opportunities are being lost because of increasingly unaffordable fees. This is why our committee believes in the principle that music tuition should be free.“However, we recognise that in many local authorities, charging for music tuition is a reality and a decision which will not have been made lightly. This does not mean there is nothing to be done. “Local authorities must work harder to make sure that those who can afford it the least do not lose out the most. This is why we have recommended that the funding for these services is re-examined and that more is done to extend concessions and discounts where possible.”Campaigner Ralph Riddiough, who presented a petition to Parliament on the issues with almost , signatures, said: “It is encouraging to have the support from the committee, although it doesn’t solve the problem.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4860115.1548100161!/image/image.jpg","title":"why my kids want to watch prince philip drive around in a field aidan smith","story":"Prince Philip apparently loves driving but perhaps it#s time to stop doing so on the public roads and find a field instead, writes Aidan Smith.My children love the stories of their great-grandfather and motorised transport. It’s not so much his daring Second World War bombing raids they want recounted again and again but the one about him driving his car across his lawn.There are many tales of scrapes real and metaphorical in his faithful old Citroen but their favourite has the starting-point of firm medical advice that maybe his motoring days were behind him, which he of course flagrantly ignored.Or to be fair circumvented. Grudgingly, he kept off the roads but reckoned he wasn’t doing any harm chugging through the neighbouring field and a few laps just before martini hour became part of his daily routine. But imagine great-granny’s surprise when she looked up from her crossword – “Three down, eight down, five across: semi-affectionate term for elderly man prone to persistent, low-level blundering” – to see him glide past the sitting-room window, flattening her beloved rose garden.Silly ... old ... goat. Great-grandpa was not far off the Duke of Edinburgh’s  when he finally had the car keys taken off him for good. He died a few years ago but the stories endure. “I hope he isn’t planning on driving to Heaven,” my youngest daughter remarked, “otherwise he might not get there.”Can we call Prince Philip a silly old goat  When the story of his little accident first broke, I think we could have done, and indeed many did. The Twitter question “Where does Prince Philip actually go in his car ” prompted much chortling . But it’s gone beyond goatery now. Hurtled right past it.: Aidan Smith: What I learned from the seven-year-old meThe more detail that emerges about his bump on the A near Sandringham in Norfolk, the messier things have become. The Duke’s blunderings, which have become persistent, cannot really be called low-level. What’s to be done with him  Well, “It’s not the destination, it’s the journey” sounds like something his grandson Prince Harry might say, the Duke of Sussex having just revealed that he’s big into meditation. Maybe the Royal who meditates every day can have a quiet, calming word with the Royal who drives every day, regardless. It could be the only solution.Prince Philip’s car collided with another carrying two women – one suffering a broken wrist – and a nine-month old boy. This might have unnerved most other -year-olds, at least until the insurers with that annoying dog for a mascot had begun processing the claim, but a replacement Land Rover was delivered to Sandringham the next day and the Duke was quickly taking it for a test drive – without wearing his seatbelt.There was an apology. Well, sort of. Buckingham Palace passed on what’s been called a “goodwill message” to the women, although this disappointed Emma Fairweather as it was delivered by a police liaison officer. A fan of the Royal Family, she’d hoped for a note or maybe some flowers and that Prince Philip himself might have said sorry. Instead the message said: “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh would like to be remembered to you.” It “didn’t even make sense”, Ms Fairweather said.: Aidan Smith: Is The Simpsons’ Groundskeeper Willie offensive to Scots If only, while out for a spin, the Duke had simply churned up a field. It might have incurred the displeasure of his eldest son on one of the Prince of Wales’ “Hello trees, hello sky” excursions, but I’m sure the old man could have lived with that. If that was all that happened last Thursday then I’m sure there would have been some sympathy for HRH.After all, he’s now retired from public le. His final official duty had to be conducted in a Biblical thunderstorm and, bless him, he braved it out. Free from royal inspections of fuse boxes, meeting fat astronauts and wondering out loudspears are still thrown, he should be permitted his fun. If Netflix’s The Crown is truthful then he loves cars, especially hanging out the back of a fast one en route to his gentleman’s club where the waitresses don’t wear many clothes. Let the man drive, for goodness sake. But this is going to be tricky now, and especially after his staff proved no less able to hold a straight and trouble-free line in the aftermath of the crash. “Weekend wheels fell off Royal PR machine” ran one headline yesterday. Such a pity, this, after a run of feel-good moments for the House of Windsor: the weddings, the new babies, the big birthdays , the addition of Holywood glamour and Kate Middleton trying to save our high streets by wearing £ dresses. Thoughtruth be told the gold piano struck a jarring note.You’ll remember this:  Christmas message, the Queen urging us all to get along with each other, nice photos of her family’s new additions resting on the ... aagh, look at that joanna! What the hell did it cost  Did Henry VIII audition a succession of court minstrels to play Greensleeves on it and,he didn’t like their playing, chop off their hands Bright sunlight has been blamed for Prince Philip’s accident. Maybe it was actually the dazzle from the piano. Either way he should definitely find a field for his driving from now on.

That’s why we’re backing the Peoples Vote, the second EU referendum.“Butthat’s not possible, in terms of our wider interests, the chaos and the fiasco of the last couple of years have shown that the worst thing for Scotland is to be thirled to Westminster when it’s making such a mess of things. We’d be far better off in charge of our own affairs.”: Brexit chaos makes case for independence ‘increasingly clear’The First Minister spoke to the Prime Minister by telephone late on Tuesday, following the unprecedented Commons defeat of the government’s Brexit deal by a margin of  votes.Downing Street says it will open talks with opposition MPs in a bid to salvage the deal, but the strength of the rejection by MPs has further raised fears that the UK could leave the EU without a deal on  March.“This is the biggest crisis the UK has faced in our letimes,” Ms Sturgeon said.“I think the PM’s position sounds asshe is deluding herself about what is possible in the next  days that hasn’t been possible in the last two and a half years.“It is time for everyone to get real, the country is facing a Brexit clf edge, we cant carry on limping towards it oblivious to the reality.“I think it makes people in Scotland think thatwe were in charge of our own affairs we would perhaps be steering a better course right now now.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848739.1547813565!/image/image.jpg","title":"these are the 6 most wanted people in scotland in 2019","story":"Can you help police track down these  men on their most wanted list Police Scotland would like to speak to the people below and are asking anyone with information to call .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vaarie ","story":"Offers over £,Detached four bedroom house, built in , with large garage and spacious garden, in excellent condition in quiet location  minutes from Lerwick."},{"url":null,"title":"lecturers go on strike at shetland college ","story":"Lecturers on the picket line outside Shetland College in Lerwick.A picket line has been formed outside Shetland College as lecturers campaign for an improved pay offer.Strike action was backed in December by . per cent of EIS-FELA union members on a turnout of . per cent.A total of  lecturers are taking shts to stand outside their Gremista workplace today , some holding placards with slogans including: “The cost of living affects us all #negotiate now”.Shetland College branch secretary Andrew Anderson said: “The last thing any lecturing staff want to do is take strike action because that does affect students and we don’t want that but we’ve been left with no other option – we’ve been put into this position.”The lecturers are wanting a better offer than that on the table – a . per cent rise covering -, previously branded “derisory” by Mr Anderson.for more..."},{"url":null,"title":"jobs template week 3 ","story":"We are initially inviting Notes of Interest from inidals who would be interested in joining our small dedicated team.Positions available are:Permanent and seasonal opportunities are available, ious hours will be considered.Wage is dependent upon age and experience.

These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8779110.1548153767!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Students from local schools were thanked by Action MS recently for their fundriaising efforts over the last year.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

They are told with the reverence and respect you would expect from someone whose fictional characters populate the very streets and alleyways he himself walked and walks. These are stories sympathetically woven from yarns shared at wakes and barricades and they are told with all the authenticity and captivating power of a backstreet seanchaí.And while the protagonists are sympathetically drawn — there are no psychopathic terrorist godfathers or feeble-minded IRA cannon-fodder here — there is deceit, treachery and even murder.If your conception of Ballymurphy circa  is based upon the ramblings of our mainstream media commentators scrambling for credibility or the pulp fiction ravings of Jack Higgins, then the short stories in ‘Gáire in Éag’ will be like epistles from another planet. If, however, you actually knew people who stored weapons for the IRA, sheltered republican active service units, engaged in armed struggle for the IRA or even betrayed the IRA — and most probably called them your neighbours — then these stories of ordinary people in extraordinary times is a tonic for the retired troops. Of course, to enjoy this exceptional collection, you will have to be able to read Irish, the literary language of ‘John Boy’ Ó Muireagáin, evennot his mother tongue. That, the author says, is the book#s strength — evenit means not all those who would be able to recognise themselves in its pages will get to enjoy it.“I don’t think you would get a publisher for this book in English,” says Seán . “To be published in English on the topic of our conflict, you need to have a certain point-of-view which often has not even the faintest connection to the reality we experienced. In ‘Idir Dhá Thine Bealtaine’, I tell the story of a woman who kept an arms dump for the IRA. I don’t judge her but I dotell her story as a writer who is very proud of the republican and nationalist people from whom I come. After all, the people who hid IRA weapons were, some might say, more heroic than the people who did the shooting. Every night, they went to sleep dreading the early-morning raid. And yet, no-one is telling the story of those overlooked heroes who are at the core of any revolution ” A member of the extended Ó Muireagáin tribe which spearheaded the Irish language revival in the Upper Springfield area, Seán, now , didn’t start writing until he was well into his forties. “I started with poems about ten years ago,” he says. “They helped me make sense of my own le but about four years ago I started to try my hand at short stories. I wanted to tell the story of my own community, a story which hasn’t been told despite the mountains of books which have been written about us. I felt I could do that in Irish easier than in English. The Irish language community is tighter and more understanding than the larger English language public and you can sidestep the inevitable condemnation which would rain down on anyone who wrote stories with this worldview in English.”His fluent story-telling style is comfortable and engaging and firmly rooted in lives which would be considered humdrum and ordinarythere wasn’t a war raging in the background. His fealty to his subjects is reminiscent of the master Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga who tells the story of an entire people without leaving the tiny mountain village of Obaba. But the Ballymurphy man’s genius with words doesn’t stop there for in setting his stories against the background of the battlefield, he takes up the mantle of Kenya’s greatest author Ngugi wa Thiong’o whose books demolish the previously accepted white-man’s-burden version of the Mau Maustruggle against British colonialism. However, anyone expecting The Victor comicbook-style war stories of republican derring-do is likely to be disappointed.“The stories are about war and conflict at a very personal level how conflict affected the lives of ordinary people,” says Seán. “In ‘Sceithire# , I look at the informer not in traditional black and white republican terms but with empathy for the tout#s family and, of course, with an eye to the mirrors-within-mirrors nether world of informers.”The longest story in the collection, Pól, is a dark, macabre helter-skelter in which an enraged lover sets out on a murderous rampage, covering up his deeds in the undergrowth of Troubles’ killings. “I always wonderedsomeone with malign intent could literally have got away with murder and through Pól I get to let my imagination roam free,” says Seán. “However, no-one should reopen any cold cases all my characters are fictional. True, many are inspired by a titbit of true information or by a real event but ultimately, this is fiction not loose talk.”Seán is keen to let his short stories do the talking for him but he does have a fascinating story of his own to tell — perhaps in memoir form now that he is taking early retirement from the Irish language agency Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta to focus on his writing. A poet, short story writer , a consummate sean-nós singer and even a stand-up comedian, Seán was a renaissance man before the term was invented but his renaissance started with the Irish language.“I am just an ordinary person who had the good luck to discover this Irish language which has nurtured me since I was a teenager,” he says. “Now I want to give back by writing plays, poems and stories which do justice to the ordinary people who make up my community and who have come through the most extraordinary times with their heads held high.”Seán Ó Muireagáin has no plans for an English language translation but what brought Atxaga and Ngugi to a wider audience, the gt of translation, could reveal this gem of a book to a wider audience in the time ahead. Indeed, that would be the perfect way to mark the centenary of our own wee country in !

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us.

An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

I see them as denying a mothers right to be with her son, with her family.\"My sister would also love to come here, but as her employment isnt earning her enough, and she has two children, which puts the threshold on income up even higher, theres no chance under current legislation that she can come to live here, again despite being a UK citizen and holding a UK passport. The world is a smaller place than it was, but I seem to be further away from my family than ever.\"Since July , when current Prime Minister Theresa May was Home Secretary, the UKs immigration rules have required non-EEAnationals to satisfy a financial minimum income requirement in order to secure a visa to join a British settled spouse or partner in the UK.Available maintenance funds equivalent to a minimum gross annual income of £, are required.

But they will run out at the end of March and she doesnt know what to so when that time comes.\"They could have had the option of moving to the Republic of Ireland, but with the Brexit deadline approaching, theres no time left to try to organise that, and once Britain leaves the EU, that option might not be available, either. We simply dont know.\"We just want to be together. Were UK citizens, but we cant live in the country of our citizenship.\"The Home Office said it could not comment considering there had been no application received for a permanent visa in this case.\"My mother has been advised by agencies in South Africa that a six-month holiday visa was the best we could hope to get to allow all of the family to be together. There was no guarantee of that, but we did eventually manage to get that arranged, though it runs out in a couple of months time,\" he added.\"My mum obviously doesnt want to leave her husband and will have toto South Africa with him but thats the way these regulations treat a family like mine.\"Theyre basically saying my mum cantto live in the UK, where she was born, unless she leaves her husband behind, and thats ridiculous.\""},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine in nearmiss with ferry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I feel that people who are doing their best arent being treated properly. \"Yes, theres fraud in the system, but there has to be a better way to deal with that than taking it out on decent people.\"My question would be: how much money has this actually saved the taxpayer  I doubt very much at all.\"Ombudsman investigations are normally only carried out on receipt of a specic complaint.However, the own initiative power allows the watchdog to act even when no complaint has been received.Ms Anderson said that following an assessment of the departments procedures, she was satisfied the criteria for an own initiative investigation have been met.The Ombudsman received  PIP complaints since June , but she was only able to act once the complaints procedure had been exhausted.A recent report from the Northern Ireland Audit Office said that , PIP decisions were made between June  and September .Around a quarter of all PIP decisions were challenged, with over halfof cases that went to an appeal tribunal being overturned.The Department for Communities said it noted the proposed investigation by the Ombudsman.\" is administered no dferently from the rest of the United Kingdom, with the exception that in Northern Ireland welfare supplementary payments are available for those who are adversely impacted by welfare changes,\" it said.\"The department is operating within the appropriate statutory mechanisms including the independent appeals process. \"Since June , , decisions have been made on PIP claims. \"To date, the department has received six referrals from the Public Services Ombudsman relating to PIP.\""},{"url":null,"title":"wedding bells for karen lyons a year on from lifesaving lung op","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Two months later, after tests at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, doctors noticed that the area around her gallbladder had become inflamed and also found a clot in her heart. Eight litres of fluid were drained from her lungs and she spent five days in intensive care before being transferred to Newcastle. Prior to the surgery, Karen was receiving oxygen  hours a day as she only had a lungof %. A fortnight before her operation she believed a match had been found, but the organs were deemed too large for her body.Finally, after a tense wait, a suitable donor was found and she had the surgery, ing home for the first time in three months last March. Since then Karen has gone from strength to strength and while she still attends the hospital in Newcastle for regular check-ups, she has delighted doctors with her quick recovery. She said: \"This time last year I had days to live and was terried I would never make it waiting for the right lungs. Luckily the beautul new lungs came and gave me my le back.\"I cant believe it has been a year. I feel like a completely dferent person and Im delighted to say I have had no rejection so its all looking great!\" As well as marking her anniversary, Karen is preparing for another milestone this week. On Friday, she will finally marry Greg at Enniskillen Town Hall - and it will be a case of third time lucky for the couple who have had to cancel their wedding twice in the past due to Karens illness. She explained \"We had initially planned to get married in Australia. \"Because my health was getting worse, we re-booked our wedding for December  but had to cancel that, too.\"We decided to go ahead over Christmas and set a date. \"After all we have been through, we wanted a small and intimate ceremony.\" They will marry in front of  family members and close friends, including Gregs parents who have flown over for the big day. As she marks one year on from her le-saving operation, Karen is particularly mindful of her organ donor and family to whom she will be forever grateful.\"Obviously I dont know what happened to my angel donor, but because of her I have been able to start living and dreaming again. \"I wish I could give her and her family the biggest hug and tell them all about my new le, hopes and dreams that they are making come true.\" Karen has been documenting her story on her My Lung Story Facebook page, in a bid to get more people signing up to become organ donors. \"You cant shut me up about organ donation - I talk about it everywhere I go to show people that this is what it does. \"I dont think a lot of people have met an organ recipient so I want to show the dference it can make to someones le. \"I know of so many people who have signed up because of my story so hopefully Im doing something right.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dublin sees hand of british in polish hint over brexit backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If Ireland appealed to the EU to change the agreement on the backstop in the agreement with the British so that it would apply temporarily, lets say five years, the matter would be solved,\" he said.\"Of course, this would be less beneficial for Ireland than an indefinite backstop, but much more favourable than the non-contractual Brexit, which inevitably approaches.\"Warsaw is one of the UKs closest allies within the EU and has repeatedly spoken out in support of May and her Brexit proposals - although has always been slapped down.Last September, at the General Affairs Council, Polands Europe Minister raised the risk of the Republic causing a no-deal but was swtly countered by heavyweight core countries like France, the Netherlands and Germany.Mr Coveney told reporters in Brussels yesterday \"putting a time limit on an insurance mechanism effectively means its not a backstop at all\".His comments were quickly backed up by Germanys Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who said: \"I am completely with my Irish colleague. He has already said what he thinks of it, which is nothing.\"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also insisted that amending the backstop is no longer an option on the table.\"The withdrawal agreement with all its dimensions, including the backstop, is the best deal possible,\" Mr Barnier said. \"It is now for the UK leaders to build a stable and positive majority for a deal. We are waiting for the next steps from the UK Government, but we are ready to work again on the political declaration.\"Irish sources last night sought to play down the signicance of Polands intervention, suggesting that it may have been a \"set-up\" between London and Warsaw.Mrs May was subsequently asked about the comments in the Commons. She said: \"I look forward to exploring in more detail the proposals that have been put forward by the Polish Foreign Minister on this particular issue of dealing with the backstop.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour not in any way backing second referendum with amendment","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a second referendum after tabling an amendment allowing MPs to vote on ways to end the “Brexit deadlock”..pushShadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the amendment had been carefully written and did not tie the party into backing a new vote “in any way”.It came as Theresa May was due to hold her weekly Cabinet meeting to discuss her next moves, with backbenchers also planning ious amendments designed to make ious changes on Tuesday.Labour’s amendment calls for a vote on Labour’s plan for a customs union with the EU, and whether to legislate “to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition” that is supported by a Commons majority. is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any wayLabours Rebecca Long BaileyFacebookTwitterBut Mrs Long Bailey reiterated to BBC Radio ’s Today programme that the party was “prioritising” its own Brexit deal.She said: “The amendment is very specically worded to allow for the debate of the options.“It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way and indeedit was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specic issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time.”However, Mrs Long Bailey also described a backbench amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper designed to stop a no-deal Brexit as “fantastic”, suggesting Labour could support it.The move came as it was understood that Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd had urged Downing Street to allow Tory MPs a free vote on moves aimed at preventing a no deal, amid fears that dozens of ministers could otherwise resign.Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Tory HQ has been effectively put on a snap general election “war footing” due to the Brexit situation in Parliament.Despite Mrs May’s claim that a second referendum could “damage social cohesion”, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the option should be considered.He said: “Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal.“It is time for Labour’s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.”In a break from usual parliamentary rules, MPs will be able to amend the so-called “neutral motion” tabled by the Prime Minister on Brexit, with votes due to take place on amendments chosen by Speaker John Bercow on January .A cross-party group of MPs, including Ms Cooper and Tory former minister Nick Boles, is seeking to give time for a Bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Labour’s Hilary Benn has tabled an amendment to the Government motion calling for a range of indicative votes on ious Brexit options.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper He tweeted: “Just tabled an amendment for next week’s Brexit debate calling for the House of Commons to hold a series of indicative votes on a way forward.”And Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve is looking to allow a motion by a minority of  MPs – from at least five parties and including  Tories – to be debated in order to allow for indicative votes on where to go next.In a sign of Labour isions on the issue of a second Brexit referendum, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn said she could not support such a move.However, Chuka Umunna, a prominent supporter of a People’s Vote, called for a firmer stance.Meanwhile, Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl poured cold water on a suggestion by her Polish counterpart that the Irish border backstop, a key stumbling block in the Brexit deal process, could be time-limited.Jacek Czaputowicz said on Monday that it could be set at five years to allow a deal to pass the UK Parliament.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But Ms Kneissl told Today her Irish counterpart Simon Coveney had made it clear “Ireland belongs to the ” at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday and “anything that was negotiated by commissioner Michel Barnier was part of the position that Ireland was part of”.She added: “We were all taken by surprise when the Polish minister made his statement.“We have had cohesion and we wish to continue having cohesion on the EU position, so the statement by our Polish colleague came as a surprise, but I don’t believe that it will cause some sort of breakthrough, certainly not becausewe start having all kinds of bilateral suggestions it doesn’t lead us anywhere.”She also dampened hopes of an extension to Article  to give the UK more time to negotiate, saying: “Where is the added value of the new British suggestion ”Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also suggested that European politicians might not all support an extension to Article the UK asked for one.He told Today there were “practical issues” over the European Parliament elections in May, adding: “From the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don’t want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against.”"},{"url":null,"title":"widening gap between rich and poor scots visiting their dentist figures suggest","story":"

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

He added:“Instead of a Plan B we got a rehash of previous statements and a commitment to inclusivity that is two years to late.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Today’s statement proves only one point – that the British state is in chaos. Boxed into a corner, the prime minister is running out of time and running out of options clinging to the DUP to help her hold on to power.”\"  \"  Police dealing with second bomb scare in N.I. housing estate - four masked men with gun hijack delivery vanBrexit: Theresa May dismisses claim she might amend Good Friday Agreement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

amendment","story":"Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the amendment had been carefully written and did not tie the party into backing a new vote ldquoin any way.It came as Theresa May was due to hold her weekly Cabinet meeting to discuss her next moves, with backbenchers also planning ious amendments designed to make ious changes on Tuesday.Labourrsquos amendment calls for a vote on Labourrsquos plan for a customs union with the EU, and whether to legislate ldquoto hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that is supported by a Commons majority.But Mrs Long Bailey reiterated to BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that the party was ldquoprioritising its own Brexit deal.She said: ldquoThe amendment is very specically worded to allow for the debate of the options.ldquoIt is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way and indeedit was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specic issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time.However, Mrs Long Bailey also described a backbench amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper designed to stop a no-deal Brexit as ldquofantastic, suggesting Labour could support it.The move came as it was understood that Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd had urged Downing Street to allow Tory MPs a free vote on moves aimed at preventing a no deal, amid fears that dozens of ministers could otherwise resign.Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Tory HQ has been effectively put on a snap general election ldquowar footing due to the Brexit situation in Parliament.Despite Mrs Mayrsquos claim that a second referendum could ldquodamage social cohesion, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the option should be considered.He said: ldquoOur amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no deal.ldquoIt is time for Labourrsquos alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.In a break from usual parliamentary rules, MPs will be able to amend the so-called ldquoneutral motion tabled by the Prime Minister on Brexit, with votes due to take place on amendments chosen by Speaker John Bercow on January .A cross-party group of MPs, including Ms Cooper and Tory former minister Nick Boles, is seeking to give time for a Bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Labourrsquos Hilary Benn has tabled an amendment to the Government motion calling for a range of indicative votes on ious Brexit options.\"Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper He tweeted: ldquoJust tabled an amendment for next weekrsquos Brexit debate calling for the House of Commons to hold a series of indicative votes on a way forward.And Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve is looking to allow a motion by a minority of  MPs ndash from at least five parties and including  Tories ndash to be debated in order to allow for indicative votes on where to go next.In a sign of Labour isions on the issue of a second Brexit referendum, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn said she could not support such a move.However, Chuka Umunna, a prominent supporter of a Peoplersquos Vote, called for a firmer stance.Meanwhile, Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl poured cold water on a suggestion by her Polish counterpart that the Irish border backstop, a key stumbling block in the Brexit deal process, could be time-limited.Jacek Czaputowicz said on Monday that it could be set at five years to allow a deal to pass the UK Parliament.\"But Ms Kneissl told Today her Irish counterpart Simon Coveney had made it clear ldquoIreland belongs to the  at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday and ldquoanything that was negotiated by commissioner Michel Barnier was part of the position that Ireland was part of.She added: ldquoWe were all taken by surprise when the Polish minister made his statement.ldquoWe have had cohesion and we wish to continue having cohesion on the EU position, so the statement by our Polish colleague came as a surprise, but I donrsquot believe that it will cause some sort of breakthrough, certainly not becausewe start having all kinds of bilateral suggestions it doesnrsquot lead us anywhere.She also dampened hopes of an extension to Article  to give the UK more time to negotiate, saying: ldquoWhere is the added value of the new British suggestion Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also suggested that European politicians might not all support an extension to Article the UK asked for one.He told Today there were ldquopractical issues over the European Parliament elections in May, adding: ldquoFrom the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they donrsquot want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against..push,i[r].l*new

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcnally.jpg","title":"brexit immigration tips for employers","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business Due to the impact of Brexit, immigration law in the UK is set to substantially change. Facing this prospect, which key areas should employers be aware of, asks Philip McNally from KPMG Legal Services  Navigating the ongoing Brexit negotiations is a challenge, particularly for employers. Much is reliant on the make-up of any final deal but, armed with the right knowledge, there are some actions which both employers and employees can take now to make sure your business is prepared.  The rights of Irish British citizens: The most frequently asked question we encounter in KPMG’s immigration practice relates to the rights of Irish employees have to work in the UK, and British employees to work in the Republic of Ireland. Due to the impact of the Common Travel Area and associated rights and privileges, Irish citizens are not considered to be ‘foreign nationals’ in the UK, and British nationals are not considered to be ‘foreign’ in the Republic of Ireland. As a result, the right of Irish citizens to work in the UK, and of British nationals to work in the Republic, will not be impacted by Brexit.  The impact on recruitment If there is a transition period, employers will be able to recruit EU nationals , just as they do now, until December  . If there is no deal, it is unclear when “free movement of people” will end. However, it could end as early as March , .  The EU Settlement Scheme Under the EU Settlement Scheme, every EU national in the UK must make an application. The application will cost £ for each adult, and is due to open in March . This scheme is set to come into force whether or not a deal is concluded between the EU and UK.  Conduct an immigration audit In order to frame your immigration Brexit planning, we suggest that you conduct an initial audit of your workforce to gauge your exposure to Brexit. You should identy how many EU employees you have, their role and the location that they work in. Thereafter you can assess what you need to do to encourage and assist such employees to retain their right to work in the UK.  Make your plan Once you know your immigration exposure, you can plan your response. If you have a low percentage of EU Nationals working in your organisation, it may be sufficient to supply those workers with information about the EU Settlement Scheme, and hope that they make the application. However,you employ a high percentage of EU workers, we advise that you intervene and assist or get assistance for these workers to make the mandatory applications.  The post-Brexit immigration system Under the proposed post-Brexit immigration system , employers will face a number of challenges. These potentially include a minimum salary requirement of £, and the necessity for a work visa for EU nationals. As such, those employers who rely on low paid EU employees, are at risk of not only losing their EU workers but will struggle to recruit after  due to the post Brexit restrictions. Bearing that in mind,your organisation is affected in this manner, we advise that you retain your existing workforce by assisting them through the EU Settlement Scheme.  KPMG’s Corporate Immigration team is assisting employers and their workers in assessing their immigration status and supporting the relevant applications to minimise the effect of Brexit on the workforce.

According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.
