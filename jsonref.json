(Pictured at the naming ceremony for the  RRS Sir David Attenborough) The Duchess, who was once afraid of public speaking, which led to her talking in affected, clipped tones, now speaks faultlessly about causes close to her heart in a more natural voice.Her increased confidence has, inevitably, been reflected in her wardrobe, too, with a subtle makeover replacing her old ‘armour’ of knee-length tailored dresses and clutch bag with bold, designer blouses and chic mini-handbags. She has a new hairstyle and has even toned down her make-up.The insight into Kate’s values emerges in a special edition of The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine today, which reveals how she has become increasingly self-assured and focused on her priorities.A source said: ‘She is very clear on her priorities and the values that guide how she lives and works. It’s about treating other people well to get the best out of them.‘She takes her role very seriously and just wants to do the best job she can.’With attention fixed on recent controversies surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Prince Andrew, Kate’s quiet transformation has gone almost unnoticed.

This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

The huge monument was also inspired by the Trevi fountain in Rome, and contains references to Damien Hirst’s formaldehyde shark, Winslow Homer’s Gulf Stream and JMW Turner’s Slave Ship.At a press conference on Monday, Walker said when she first visited Europe she was shocked by the grand scale of colonial-era monuments. “I think as an American girl coming to Europe for the first time as an art student, I was perversely moved by the grandeur of the palaces,” she said. “Because it really is very jarring when you think about what that’s built on the backs of.”Walker said there was a direct comparison between the Confederate statues in the US, which have polarised opinion and triggered a debate about whether they are inherently racist, and monuments to the British empire such as the Victoria memorial. “It’s only really recently that there’s been a concerted national conversation about these monuments, about how they got there and what they mean,” she said.The artist, best-known for her 2014 work A Subtlety, the huge sphinx-like figure she housed in an old sugar factory, told the  the Turbine Hall commission was an “irresistible … grand prize”, and that she had had to educate herself about the history of race and Britain in preparation.Hilton Als, the New Yorker critic and curator of a solo show at Sprüth Magers that coincides with her Tate commission, said Walker was a “social critic with heart” whose work has consistently explored America and Britain’s shared and complex racial history.“One of the things that is powerful about Walker is her work about slavery, and how black people were traded by the British and Portuguese,” said Als. “The African-American relationship to Britain is a very complicated one and she is again examining it in a powerful way.”Walker said both Kehinde Wiley’s newly installed Times Square monument, Rumors of War, which is 8 metres (26ft) tall and references Confederate statues, and her own Turbine Hall commission formed “an interesting moment for monumentality”. “What the Confederate debate and removal of statues from places like New Orleans has done is not just reignited the debate, but unearthed the racism and cruelties that have lived fairly quietly under the surface for some time,” she said.Als said both works addressing Confederate and colonial monuments showed both artists’ desire to engage with contemporary issues.“It’s like James Baldwin said, he never wanted to be in an ivory tower cultivating his talent, he wanted to be out in the world expressing it,” he said. “It’s a continuation of this idea that the artist wants to be in the moment and commenting on the world around them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0574bda34dbb29ad7f14aeff295c4d44591f7c46/0_65_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc46a3448f7993dd2f07d2103b9835a2","title":"the street artists taking over scaffolding new york city canvas","story":"In a new project, female and non-binary artists have created murals to enliven construction boards in New York CityConstruction work in New York City is practically a proverb – there’s always loud drilling and banging on a set of scaffolding somewhere.But while New Yorkers might see the green-painted plywood construction slabs practically everywhere – the city has over 300 miles of street-level construction – one initiative is hoping to beautify the blahs and paint them red, yellow, blue and greens with the help of some local artists, for a new project called City Canvas.Strangely, it isn’t on canvas, but wood. This first project that kickstarts the series features murals from seven New York women and non-binary artists outside of the Google office in Chelsea, where they’ve painted on murals that stretch across 8th to 9th Avenue on West 16th Street.It’s powered by ArtBridge, a public art non-profit, who have teamed up with the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, the mayor’s office and Google to bring what ArtBridge’s director Stephen Pierson says, is an initiative “to promote early and mid-career artists, but especially those whose backgrounds and narratives have traditionally been disempowered or marginalized”.He adds: “We aim to not merely beautify the city but empower local artists to be community-builders.”The current project will be up until the winter, but other similar projects will pop up over the next two years, not only on wood, but construction sheds and fences across the city, too.The main goal was to use construction boards across the city as a space where artists – and their Instagram handles – can snag the attentions of passersby looking up (instead of gazing down at their smartphones).“Why not use it as a canvas for talented artists?” asked Brad Holyman, New York state senator, at the impromptu press conference held in a basketball court. “It’s for anyone who can look up and see these amazing artists and their work.”That artwork, across the streets from the basketball court on West 16th Street, includes portraits by Jess X Snow, who writes: “Our queer joy breaks borders and binaries,” adding that “I uplift the legacy of queer non-binary and transgender folks of color that call New York City our home.”There are also artworks by Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, whose stunning portraits of black women have been called Stop Telling Women to Smile, while Natasha Platt has painted a series of flowers, brightening up the street.Gera Lozano, whose street artist name is GeraLuz, has used a repetitive abstract pattern that ties into what she calls going “from the Amazon jungle to the concrete jungle”.“In my artwork, I feel like an agent of mother Earth,” she says. “She speaks through climate change and hurricanes, but she also speaks through me.”ArtBridge hopes to bring roughly 30 mural projects over the two-year period to all five boroughs. “We want to get artists where they can be seen, as well as low income areas that could use beautification,” said Pierson. “We will use the scaffolding around these buildings to bridge the ide between residents and the surrounding communities.”Google approached ArtBridge to beautify their building, which is under construction, offering a budget of $35,000. According to Pierson, the future projects will be funded by foundation grants, inidual donors and corporate sponsors. “Many of our exhibitions will derive from partnerships with local, community-based organizations,” he said.One artist on view here, Danielle Mastrion, painted a pair of women’s eyes looking down at you. “Lack of eye contact in our city is either to avoid conflict with another person or because they’re on their phones and are not paying attention or looking around,” she said. “This project makes people look up, even for a second.”But with the world’s most notable street artists being white men – from Shepard Fairey to Banksy, KAWS and JR – it’s about time for women to be recognized for their contribution, as well.“Street art is very male driven, but the more women are painting, the more it will inspire other women to paint,” said Mastrion. “I hope that in five or 10 years from now, we’re not just women street artists, we’re just artists.”This project could be an important step towards that. “There needs to be more projects like this, where women are put to the forefront, as it’s not just a mural project with just one token woman artist,” she said. “That happens all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05d7dd157c728474828189c04a63ba019476d03c/0_0_3954_3199/master/3954.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4bff0049a02229ffb7f41495bdff2acd 1400w","title":"crispin odey denies backing no deal brexit shorting opportunity","story":"Hedge fund manager says he is optimistic about UK and claims as to motivations are ‘rubbish’Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who is a leading backer of a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson, has dismissed claims his support is motivated by an opportunity to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound as “absolute rubbish”.Odey told the  he was optimistic about the prospects for the UK after Brexit, denied influencing strategy at No 10 and said his fund had an overall “neutral” position on UK stocks.The founder of Odey Asset Management said he had spoken to Boris Johnson only once since he became Conservative leader, “two days after, to say congratulations”. He added: “I am an observer. When it comes to his strategy, I am not involved.”Over the weekend, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, questioned the political connections of some hedge fund managers backing a no-deal Brexit, and the former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson argued he was right to do so. Responding to the criticisms on Monday, Odey said: “It’s absolute rubbish. It really is. Politics doesn’t drive markets. Markets are very bad at observing political events because they are not monetary.In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, the government rejected claims from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, that Johnson risked a conflict of interest if a no-deal Brexit benefited his friends and donors.“Isn’t there a danger the promotion of a no-deal scare by the prime minister, resulting in profiteering by his friends and donors, could be seen as a conflict of interest by any standard and contrary to the ministerial code?” McDonnell asked.Odey donated £10,000 to Johnson’s Conservative leadership campaign and has given almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns in the past. The wealth of Odey and his wife, Nichola Pease, has been put at £775m by the Sunday Times rich list.Odey said he supported holding a general election, arguing “the problem is that this parliament was never set up to deal with Brexit”.A fresh election, he said, might result in a parliament that was “more closely aligned to opinion in the country, so not 80:20 but 50:50. It is not good for the country that we live on a knife edge every single day and everyone wants to postpone.”“Most people’s view of the UK is that ‘it’s not going to get any better’. My view is that, if we get out, we will have all this invigoration of things we have got to do, including reforming the constitution. There are parts to the constitution that need reform, including the upper house, which is far too large,” he said.“The idea that Boris is a tyrant doesn’t make sense, if you look at the experience of his time as mayor of London. He is an enterprise man.”Asked why Hammond and Macpherson might question his motives, Odey responded: “It’s the deep state. They are feeling, for the first time, a little bit frustrated.”He backed a no-deal Brexit, he said, because alternative methods of leaving the EU would lumber the UK with the equivalent of unattractive “non-voting shares”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381546f116c5113976a961145ba36d260a400d74/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edbc2e09cfa28e5c5f042c1557e65216","title":"wework scraps share sale adam neumann","story":"WeWork has pulled plans for a share sale after ousting its founder and amid investor scepticism over its sky-high valuation. The decision leaves the rental company facing a cash crunch as its new bosses prepare to make deep cuts to stem its massive losses.In a statement, WeWork’s newly installed co-chief executives, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, said they had suspended the initial public offering to “focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong”.The pair said they “have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future”.The shared workspace operator had planned to start an investor roadshow earlier this month before an IPO. But the company, which had been valued at $47bn earlier this year, found investors worried by its valuation and by corporate governance issues. It was forced to slash its valuation by more than half.Last week, the co-founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, was ousted from the company, which was until recently the most valuable startup in the US.Neumann was axed after the Wall Street Journal revealed he had taken $700m out of the company before the IPO. Investors questioned a dual-class share sale that would have given Neumann and his associates total control even after the IPO.Neumann’s eccentric behavior further undermined his position, with reports of marijuana smoking on private jets, tequila shot-fueled meetings, and claims he was working on becoming immortal.WeWork’s new co-chiefs are reportedly planning thousands of job cuts and other cost-saving measures, including the sale of a $60m jet bought last year, as they seek to staunch WeWork’s massive losses. Some 5,000 employees, one-third of the company’s workers, could lose their jobs.The company has amassed losses of $3bn over the last three years and could run out of money some time after the first quarter of 2020, according to Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein \u0026amp Co. We Co, as WeWork’s parent is called, had $2.5bn of cash as of 30 June and is running through about $700m each quarter.We reported spending $1.3bn in 2018.The company would have raised billions for new spending from the IPO and had been expected to receive loans of $6bn if the share sale had gone ahead at its original price.The company’s cash position is further complicated by a bond offering that We made last year. Under the terms of that deal We must keep at least $500m of cash, according to S\u0026ampP Global Ratings. Last week S\u0026ampP downgraded the company’s bonds to negative from stable.We’s stock market flop is the biggest failure yet for the new generation of tech giants. The company is the largest private tenant in Manhattan and London and is still growing rapidly. But its once enormous valuation has been cut as investors have questioned its claim to be a tech company that runs a “physical social network” and started to value it as a property firm.WeWork rival IWS, which also runs co-working spaces, and is of a similar size to WeWork is valued at just $3.6bn, a third of the $10bn some analysts have claimed We is now worth.The pace of We’s expansion is expected to slow as landlords become more cautious of signing deals with the company. rents offices from WeWork in the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/038d8d7fa0dce0aafaf99bb4a2877f16140095dd/0_494_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1210c6d08269787975a8e6d6651b19bd","title":"weworks long road to rehabilitation starts with ditching its co founder","story":"Officially the firm’s IPO is on pause but it looks impossible as long as Adam Neumann stays aroundOfficially, WeWork is “postponing” its initial public offering (IPO), or stock market flotation, and could return for another attempt soon. Well, good luck. The uncertain road to rehabilitation looks more like the work of many years.The new co-chief executives, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, are dropping the right hints about selling the Gulfstream jet and cutting thousands of jobs. One assumes WeWork will also jettison its corporate drivel about “elevating the world’s consciousness” if it now accepts it’s a regular company in the dull world of shared office spaces.Yet the first big task is daunting. WeWork requires money – and quickly. It reported about $2.5bn (£2bn) in cash at the end of June. Halting the signing of new lease agreements can help to make the money last longer than next spring, which was the trajectory in the IPO prospectus. But it still needs SoftBank, the Japanese fund that has been the prime backer, to step up. That transaction has to happen, as opposed to just being talked about.As for profits, last year’s outcome was a loss of $1.6bn on sales of $1.8bn. Would-be investors surely won’t touch the shares until they can see hard bottom-line income that can withstand a market downturn.Still, if the journey is long, it will allow time to remove the co-founder Adam Neumann entirely. He’s been shoved into the chair’s seat, which some seem to believe solves the many governance headaches. It doesn’t. While Neumann is still hanging around, WeWork deserves to be uninvestable for the public markets.Susan Searle, the chair of Woodford Patient Capital Trust, is playing things by the book, merely saying the board is “continuing to evaluate” the position of Neil Woodford as manager of the investment trust.Three months ago, in the aftermath of the crisis in Woodford’s empire, fence-sitting was understandable. It was too soon to ditch a manager who had assembled an esoteric collection of mostly unquoted stocks. But now? Searle needs to prepare the sacking letter.Woodford himself, as ever, was full of apologies in the half-year update but the damage has been done. The crossover in unquoted holdings between Patient Capital and the gated Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF) has been a disaster for investors in the former. The shrinking WEIF fund hasn’t been able to support follow-on funding for companies in both portfolios, thereby hitting the value of assets in Patient Capital.More fundamentally, Woodford has made poor bets. The quoted fund has been whacked by steep writedowns in recent weeks on two major investments, energy company Industrial Heat and BenevolentAI. For all his plaintive pleas about long-term opportunities (“It only requires a few of the larger companies in the portfolio to deliver …” ) the fact is that the trust’s asset value sits at 65p versus 100p at launch in 2015.The share price, 44.9p, is even lower for a combination of reasons. First, the market fears more writedowns. Second, outsiders don’t know who will be managing the trust in future.Searle could help to remove the latter problem by getting on with the obvious handover. Woodford had his chance – it’s time to move on.What were they doing in Prudential’s boardroom? Were they too busy counting the fortunes being made in Asia to notice that post-crisis regulators in the UK might one day jump on underhand tactics that could short-change customers?The dates are the astonishing feature of the near-£24m fine for the Pru for “serious breaches” in its annuities business. From July 2008 to September 2017, says the Financial Conduct Authority, the insurer failed to advise customers that they might get a better deal if they shopped around.In the banking world, the scandal over payment protection insurance bubbled away for years before Lloyds threw in the towel in 2011. That affair, you might have assumed, would have served as a prompt for the Pru’s board to ensure their own organisation was squeaky clean when selling a more crucial financial product for customers.As it happens, Prudential at the start of 2013 did reform a system that could almost have been designed to create abuses: it stopped offering sales-linked incentives, such as bonuses and spa breaks, to call-handlers. But the FCA’s report also establishes that as late as 2015 some scripts used by call-handlers were substandard.The Pru got out of the non-advised annuity business in February 2017. So – aside from a total £400m provision – the tale can be regarded as ancient history. Certainly, the demerger of asset manager M\u0026ampG will not be affected. But, as an example of how toxic practices can fester for years in financial services, the main elements are depressingly familiar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b868aa799f95ee35270f7559c4253ff4ccd66f/0_185_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071b51fad74ce2b29e7ea378b4a278e7","title":"hong kong pro democracy movement china","story":"Western governments could have joined the battle against China’s repression. Instead they offered spineless servitudeWho lost Hong Kong? It’s a question that should worry – and anger – western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony’s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China’s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable.The malign nature of Beijing’s looming actions may only be intensified by the large-scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People’s Republic’s 70th anniversary. Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans, pre-emptive arrests, brutal police tactics and media intimidation. But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence, similar to that seen at the weekend.If Hong Kong’s battle for democracy – meaning universal suffrage, direct elections, civil rights, free speech and observance of the rule of law – has not already been lost, it is teetering on the brink. This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests when they began in June have suddenly changed their view on Beijing’s devious efforts to deepen its control.It is certainly not because the protesters have miscalculated or somehow blown their chance of change. In promoting their demands they have, for the most part, shown dignity, eloquence, restraint, persistence and admirable innovation, for example through “be water” pop-up demos, organic ground-up organisation and alternative peer-to-peer social media. These are future paradigms for global protest.But after four months of epic struggle, what do the pro-democracy forces have to show? Official withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the upheaval is their sole tangible victory to date. Meanwhile, increased violence involving a minority of protesters is playing into Beijing’s hands, feeding its false narratives about malign agitators, terrorists and foreign agents.The cause is being lost because, firstly, it was always a grievously unequal battle. China’s rulers, initially taken aback by the scale and intensity of its inhabitants’ alienation, are now moving with growing determination to suppress it, not address it. They can do so with increased confidence because the turmoil has not prompted significant copycat protests in one-party mainland China, as some initially predicted.Beijing is winning because no discernible internal political challenge has emerged to Xi Jinping, China’s paramount leader – even though his inflexible and complacent approach has made matters worse. Xi, a strongman leader who casts himself as a latterday Mao with a little red online book of political thoughts to match, is not backing off. He’s doubling down.Beijing is also winning because Hong Kong is no longer quite the vital financial and commercial hub it once was. It was once the primary gateway to China now the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong. Beijing is winning because the painstakingly fabricated “one country, two systems” fudge agreed with Britain in 1997 has not lasted the course. Nowadays it is seen from Beijing as less of an asset, more a liability – an artificial arrangement potentially prolonging mainland exposure to Hong Kong’s subversive ideas.At the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China’s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing’s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced. What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China’s adaptability – and the Communist party’s undying attachment to political uniformity, not plurality.If Hong Kong’s battle is indeed lost, could the pro-democracy movement – with the odds stacked against it – have reasonably expected any other outcome? Yes, it could. Such hopes were not wholly delusional. As a legal guarantor of Hong Kong’s freedoms, Britain has a duty to stand up to China’s repressive behaviour. But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges, it has signally failed to do so. Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing.The US counts itself a champion of global democratic values, or did so before Donald Trump took office. Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action. If the US applies punitive measures to China, they concern unfair business practices – not human rights. In fact, Trump’s ruinous trade war has intensified Beijing’s paranoid sense of a hostile global contest. In such circumstances, any unilateral climbdown, anywhere, is deemed politically unacceptable.Despite waging a trade war, Trump also frequently praises Xi under the mistaken impression that insincere flattery will render him more amenable. Yet the behaviour of other western governments since the Hong Kong crisis blew up has been no less servile. What this spineless dereliction implies for other, similar pro-democracy movements opposed to authoritarian regimes, such as those in Egypt and Russia, or for China’s persecuted Uighur and Hui Muslim minorities, is gravely dismaying.In Washington, London and other capitals, it’s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads. Perhaps it was always thus. Yet if Hong Kong is permanently, definitively lost to democracy, it will be, at least in part, because the west failed to fight for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1452ac1bfa6c3f7746341599f588649ef209f31a/278_275_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b80d0e51cd4b3aa1d6f28268e798d31","title":"the guardian view on the peoples republic of china at 70 whose history","story":"Seven decades of Communist rule have seen notable advances but at horrific costThe 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, which will be marked on Tuesday by a mass military parade in the heart of Beijing, is less a historical commemoration than a political event. The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to “recall past bitterness”, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands history’s importance better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that “historical nihilism” was an existential threat to the party’s rule on a par with western democracy.The tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic’s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the People’s Liberation Army unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges.Many in China are grateful for the party’s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in life, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao’s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution.Even some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state’s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls vocational training centres. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China’s own law to uphold basic rights.The party-state’s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly “Tiananmen mothers” who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today.Since the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on “national education”, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to “national humiliation”. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth – fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation – are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state’s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections – undermining Beijing’s hopes.Under these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The “people’s leader” has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the idea of struggle. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more.

Many announcements crumble under scrutinyLook at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did – ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country.Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use “any means necessary” to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.Observers ask if this party is falling apart in front of our eyes: expelling its MPs, pursuing a no-deal Brexit whose catastrophic effects would render the party unelectable for ever. If they only knew it, the Benn Act – preventing a no-deal crashout at the end of next month – saves them from themselves. Some of the 21 banished will not be kept away: Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve and David Gauke brave the hissing. Any moderates here stay quiet, expect for one businessman tapping me on the shoulder, despairing at what no deal would do to his company. He handed me a paper. I was amazed to find a timeline of the rise of the Nazis. “That’s how Hitler did it, used the constitution step by step,” he murmured. Even the moderates are extreme.After a decade of the most savage erosion of every service, the pre-election spending announced by the chancellor will not begin to repair the damage. More hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny – not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six. “A relatively gradual increase in spending,” said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Welcome, yes, but Sajid Javid’s offer of “a decade of renewal” will be greeted with wry disbelief, too late to change public perceptions when voters see the threadbare services around them.Taking a breather from the fetid airlessness of this conference where all intellectual oxygen has been sucked out by “Get Brexit done”, I found Coffee4Craig, a small haven for the homeless, open two hours an evening for food, clothes and advice. Risha Lancaster opened it when her brother died on the streets from a heroin overdose. Among the old-timers, such as the woman in the wheelchair who comes for supper every night, she is alarmed to find so many more newcomers: she tries to ert them towards early help. “They get beaten up, everything stolen, especially shoes and ID. Everything spirals out of control.”The five-week wait for universal credit, along with benefits sanctions, tips many on to the street. “There’s nowhere to send them for mental health, so many addiction services shut down. There’s no beds.” Several have stumbled in to die here, turned out by hospitals. Here is the 54-year-old woman in a flowery blouse thrown out by her landlord, and a live-in chef sacked with no benefits for rent. “Not the council’s fault, after all the cuts to their funds. They do all they can.”The end of austerity will be a long time arriving here, if ever. Rough sleepers are only the most visible sign of the disintegration of all key services – from housing to A\u0026ampE waiting times, and benefit levels that no longer keep working families’ heads above poverty. None of this is anywhere on Johnson’s one nation horizon.He may think spaffing some last-minute cash has shot Labour’s fox. I doubt many voters will think austerity is over until there are no homeless in their supermarket doorways, until they can get a GP appointment, schools stop begging for pens, and the government takes the climate emergency seriously – virtually unmentioned here. Brexit stirs strong passions, but come an election the state of the nation counts for more – and the Tories will have no cover for their abysmal decade of strife and decay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

But analysis by the School Cuts coalition shows the additional funding is not enough to repair the damage that has been done to our schools and colleges and that further investment is required. We are not being churlish, we are just stating the facts. The funding crisis is not over.”According to School Cuts, children in almost all local authorities in England will lose out and schools with the highest levels of deprivation will be worst affected despite the government’s funding injection.Education for the 16 to 19 age group, which has been particularly badly hit by austerity in recent years, will still face a shortfall of £1.1bn, despite the government’s promises on additional funding, School Cuts claims. Even with the additional £700m promised for children with special educational needs and disabilities, campaigners say that high needs block funding, which supports the most vulnerable children and young people, will still be £1.5bn short.Kevin Courtney, the NEU joint general secretary, said: “Johnson has made lots of empty promises on school funding – but his numbers don’t add up. The latest funding announcement falls well short of settling the shortfall for every child. And crucially it fails to reverse the cuts schools have suffered since 2015.”John Richards, the head of Unison’s education ision, said: “Schools are so cash starved that staff are buying equipment like pens and stationery with their own money. Valuable teaching assistants are also being axed by schools as they struggle to balance budgets. The government keeps promising resources but schools need money now.”“The government has committed to extra funding of £4.3bn per year in today’s prices, which will be enough to reverse cuts on average. However, that won’t fully come in until 2022. It’s therefore unsurprising to see analysis showing that most schools will have lower budgets in real-terms next year as compared with 2015.”The Department for Education said the government had announced the biggest funding boost for schools in a decade which would give every school more money for every child. “We are investing a total of £14bn more in schools over the next three years to 2022-23,” a spokesperson said.“This means all secondary schools will receive a minimum of at least £5,000 per pupil next year while all primary schools will get a minimum of at least £4,000 from 2021-22 – with the biggest increases going to the schools that need it most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81f493da4b8a2287234a9e3ed38372e09d99d80/0_192_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e754ddc2c614b6cc49831fba4f9eda","title":"statement sleeves and sharp tailoring the enduring style legacy of judy garland","story":"As Renée Zellweger gears up to play the Hollywood star in Judy, the film’s costume designer explains why Garland’s clothes are as memorable as her voice and one-linersPicture Judy Garland and what do you see? For many, it will be a rosy-cheeked 17-year-old in a blue-and-white gingham pinafore en route to the Emerald City. No surprise, then, that when the fabric of picnic hampers began its fashion renaissance circa spring 2016, appearing on catwalks, Instagram and the woman next to you on the bus as frequently as Dorothy longed for home, Garland’s character was often cited as style inspiration. The checked print is a byword for the wholesomeness associated with this young girl from Kansas – and fashion wanted a slice of it.Watching the new biopic Judy, in which Garland is played by Renée Zellweger, it’s clear her style didn’t start and end with that pinafore. Before Garland’s death, after an accidental overdose at the age of 47, she starred in more than 20 films and, according to the film’s costume designer, Jany Temime, Garland’s style is as enduring a part of her legacy as her voice, warmth, and one-liners.“She had a very specific style,” says Temime. “She was always playing. She was a comic a witty woman.” She thinks of the outfit she dressed Zellweger in for the scene of Garland’s wedding to Mickey Deans, her final, short-lived marriage. The short blue dress, with frills at the neck and a matching blue pillbox hat was a look that Temime interpreted for the film, “but the original is as stupid and silly as that. She styled it herself with that little hat. That’s so Judy Garland. She was trying to have fun with life.” And fashion fun rang out via her love of feathers and sequins.The film focuses the spotlight on her later life, specifically the year before her death in 1969. Tweaked out after decades of drug addiction and alcoholism, broke and haunted by past trauma, she is forced to go to London for five-weeks of performances at the Talk of the Town cabaret club in a bid to earn enough money to help her reunite with her two younger children.The costumes were all inspired by things Garland wore, but nothing is an exact copy “because we had very heavy copyright” says Temime, “but also because I didn’t want to copy. The film is about Judy Garland, but it’s not a documentary about Judy Garland it’s a drama.”Red scarves worn by Garland were reinterpreted as a giant red bow tie on Zellweger’s character – a nod, says Temime, to the well-known tune Be a Clown. A red, pleated frock Temime saw Garland wearing in an interview became a red dress worn during an ill-fated TV appearance, followed by an ill-fated performance at the club.“It was understanding her and thinking she would have worn red at that moment – I was having a sort of sixth sense telling me this.”“It was much better to work in opposition on that film,” says Temime of the clothes. For example, at the start of the film, when Garland finds herself essentially homeless, Temime dressed her in a bright orange jacquard suit and green silk blouse. “She’s trying to find a hotel to spend the night, and she’s dressed up for the stage. This is her life at that moment. She is a star without a roof, but she had to look like a star.”In a later scene, before a high-stakes opening night performance and shut away in her hotel bathroom, Garland makes for a crumbling figure, but her clothes would have you believe otherwise. Her dress, says Temime, is “a very big contrast with her state of mind at that moment … She feels like a piece of shit, she feels terrible, she’s drinking, she cannot sleep, she’s full of drugs.” But the outfit speaks of Hollywood glamour meeting the London stage. Later, when she is buoyed up by a successful first night in London, Temime dresses her in pastels: “She starts feeling better, so I thought I don’t need, any more, the aggression of the colour.”Garland’s style has echoes in the modern day beyond picnic hamper-chic. Look to the statement sleeves that her character, Esther, wore in Meet Me in St Louis – now ubiquitous, from high-end brands such as Balmain to high-street shops such as Zara. Or the waistcoat and tailored jacket she wore in A Star Is Born, which wouldn’t look out of place at the most recent Marc Jacobs, Gucci or Burberry shows.Then, of course, there’s the prairie dress, which has made the last few seasons feel like O Pioneers! – or a journey down the Yellow Brick Road. Garland’s off-duty “mum wardrobe” in the film, which Temime made distinct from her more glamorous variety looks, chimes with the kind of easy style Miuccia Prada likes to champion. There are abstract printed shirts and camel-coloured cigarette trousers. “She was a woman from the States, and in the States they were wearing slacks,” Temime says.The modern feeling of some of the costumes helps to hammer home the present-day echoes of Garland’s story. It was during her adolescence, which played out on sets, that she first became addicted to the drugs that would cause her death – MGM, to which she signed at 13, would give her amphetamines to keep her awake for long working days, and barbiturates to sleep on command. The film flashes back to these years of weight-shaming and abuse. It is no secret that child stars are also often beset by difficulties well into adulthood. “It could have happened today,” says Temime. “We have lots of examples.”Despite using lots of vintage clothes, she didn’t want it to feel like she was creating a historical figure, hoping instead to make her feel dynamic and alive. “I didn’t want to put Judy Garland in a pocket of 1968,” she says. “At a certain point you forget that it was once upon a time, it could be now,” she says. “I wanted to make it feel like she is completely eternal. She could still be alive. She’s not dead, she’s still there and everything she was wearing we could wear it now.”• Judy is released in the UK on 2 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0036be9aabfaa74bf3942a71adad323c3fb47b3/0_101_2789_1674/master/2789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaedf9b994c41be69b69d0bb20fac5bb","title":"hollywood film industry ageism judy garland renee zellweger","story":"Renée Zellweger’s Garland biopic is a powerful reminder of the attitudes that infect youth-obsessed HollywoodIn 1962, Judy Garland received an Oscar nomination for her role in Judgment at Nuremberg and regarded it as an auspicious restart for her career. She had been thrown into the deep end of Hollywood’s unforgiving waters as a child actor, and since her early success, every aspect of her life had been marred by desperate attempts to keep her head above water. Unsuccessful marriages to other struggling artists, an addiction to drugs that was spurred on by abusive producers and, above all, her constant anxiety to control her appearance – all these problems were symptoms of her toxic relationship with Hollywood. “Isn’t this pretty good for somebody Hollywood thought as too old, too fat and too undependable to offer a job?” she wrote. Judy, the new film starring Renée Zellweger, recounts the sad ending that she was heading for instead.Judy joins the list of Hollywood biopics that carry an air of atonement, in which the misfortunes of earlier generations of stars who were cast away from the industry – largely due to their age – are memorialised and sentimentalised. Films such as The Artist and Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool have an admirable goal: celebrating the lives of performers who were callously underappreciated toward the end of their careers. But it is becoming more and more difficult to take away a positive message when Hollywood itself draws attention to how much Hollywood hasn’t changed.The star of Judy is herself re-emerging from a hiatus: one that was caused by the same maladies afflicting old Hollywood that the movie depicts. Zellweger retreated from acting after she entered Hollywood’s dead zone for women aged 40 or over. She borrows from a familiar sense of disenchantment with the profession when she tries to give life to Garland’s emotional state at the end of her life. In interviews for the movie, Zellweger says she is ready for the roles that will embody her maturity. Whether the studios have the same plans remains to be seen.Some big-screen veterans still attract an enthusiastic audience. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy, which explored the lives of retired Brits living in an Indian hotel, exceeded expectations by grossing more than $130m worldwide. Book Club put the same trust in the box-office power of older American actors, including Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen. Both movies secured sequels and softened the industry’s attitude towards taking risks with older actors.But for every hard-earned movie project that serves the age demographic well by telling a complicated story about old age, Hollywood churns out two Schwarzenegger movies with tag lines like, “Retirement is for sissies”. There are obviously Hollywood pitch meetings reserved for the older male action stars of the 80s. Twelve of the 15 highest-grossing movies of that decade have been remade, and most of them are produced to mask the age of their stars. Rambo 5, Terminator 6, Die Hard 5, Indiana Jones 5 and now the second Top Gun, all ride the new American myth of super-agers.To pull this off, Hollywood encourages bizarre anti-ageing clinics even as it abandons the female stars of the 80s, pairing their former male co-stars with much younger on-screen love interests. And now the industry has added a new weapon to its digital arsenal: de-ageing technology. Advocates believe that VFX technology could help ameliorate the representation problem. But it’s more likely that de-ageing technology help Hollywood avoid the problem of finding roles for older stars by erasing signs of age as opposed to embracing them.In the past, small- to mid-budget projects have been the most welcoming to older stars. Many darlings of the screen who hit their peak in the 1940s, 50s and the 60s bid their adieu delivering memorable performances in this subgenre. Among them were Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda playing ageing parents in On Golden Pond, John Wayne as an out-of-time gunslinger in The Shootist, and Julie Christie as a woman struggling with memory loss in Away from Her. More recent examples – Robert Redford in The Old Man and the Gun and Clint Eastwood in The Mule – underwhelmed artistically and commercially. Perhaps Marlon Brando was the most accurate predictor of the future. Toward the end of his career, he had come to terms with Hollywood’s commodification of youth and vitality. He sought the help of early adopters of VFX technology to create an animated 3D version of his face, believing that the studios would, after his death, want to keep a young Brando alive on the screen. “Maybe this is the swan song for all of us,” he said, even though it’s not real and “inside a computer”. Today, Hollywood’s fascination with de-ageing technology seems to affirm Brando’s bleak premonition, as it continues to insist older actors surrender to its obsession with youth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01253320259719b205ca5bd80d3936b52ebfbf0c/0_0_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2482aa3bc362a613a54c3c94e01026b4","title":"cardiff ordered to pay nantes 6m over emiliano sala transfer","story":"Cardiff City have been ordered to pay Nantes the first €6m (£5.3m) instalment of the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala, which is a defeat for the club’s argument that the contract to sign the player was not fully concluded at the time he died in a plane crash on 21 January.Fifa’s players’ status committee, which determines disputes relating to international transfers, found against Cardiff and in favour of the French Ligue 1 club, for whom the 28-year-old Argentinian striker had been the top scorer before Cardiff signed him.Nantes are expected to seek the two further annual instalments when they fall due, and the Fifa ruling means Cardiff are likely to be ordered to pay them.Cardiff publicly announced Sala as their record signing on 19 January but after his death the club refused to pay Nantes the due first instalment, arguing that the contract had not been legally concluded. In an assertive response after Nantes took the case to Fifa Cardiff claimed the terms proposed in the contract breached Premier League rules governing signing-on fees and that four specific clauses still needed to be renegotiated and finalised.Nantes, however, argued that all required paperwork had been completed and filed and that Fifa had registered the international transfer certificate for Sala at 5.30pm on 21 January.The Piper Malibu light aircraft commissioned to fly Sala back to say his farewells at Nantes crashed on the return flight, at 8.16pm that night.Last month investigators stated that Sala had potentially fatal levels of carbon monoxide in his blood and the pilot, Dave Ibbotson, 59, was likely to have been similarly exposed as the cockpit was not separate from the cabin. Ibbotson’s body has never been found.Fifa said in a statement announcing the decision of its 24-person players’ status committee, which is chaired by a senior South African lawyer, Raymond Hack: “In a meeting held on 25 September 2019 the Fifa players’ status committee established that Cardiff City FC must pay FC Nantes the sum of €6,000,000, corresponding to the first instalment due in accordance with the transfer agreement concluded between the parties on 19 January 2019 for the transfer of the late Emiliano Sala from FC Nantes to Cardiff City FC.“The Fifa players’ status committee, which never lost sight of the specific and unique circumstances of this tragic situation during its deliberations on the dispute at stake, refrained from imposing procedural costs on the parties.“Within a deadline of 10 days Cardiff and Nantes can request a copy of the grounds of the decision, which can be appealed to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne.”A spokesman for Cardiff said the club will be “seeking further clarification” from Fifa on the ruling “in order to make an informed decision on our next steps”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2024754de2bb0fa78965d746bdd78495fdf7181e/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6ee65ac64360730fc44bf8212f10d6","title":"manchester city to face atletico madrid in last 16 of womens champions league","story":"Manchester City were handed a tricky tie in the Champions League last-16 draw, with Nick Cushing’s side set to face the Spanish champions, Atlético Madrid, as Arsenal were paired with Slavia Prague.City cruised past the Swiss side Lugano 11-1 to reach the second knockout round but they will be out to make amends after the team whimpered out of the competition to Atlético in the round of 32 last season.

Let’s hope that carries on in the second period.45+1 min: Well, I don’t think anyone saw that coming. James did brilliantly on the break, his cross just evading Rashford. The England striker, though, kept the ball alive and pulled it back to the edge of the box where McTominay took a touch and fired home, via a slight touch of Sokratis.Crikey! What a strike this is!

The forward, though, looks a little tentative and defenders get back to smother the danger. 41 min: Young clatters Guendouzi (who has been in the wars this half) and goes into the book. Four yellows so far.40 min: Pogba is loose with his control. Again. But he’s hardly been alone this half.38 min: It’s always nice to be surrounded by friends. But here we’ve got a Friend being surrounded. Pepe and McTominay clash in midfield and the referee gives the free-kick Arsenal’s way – cue protestations – before changing his mind (correctly). 36 min: Arsenal get a shot on target away. Aubameyang finds Pepe at the back post but De Gea gathers his weak shot.35 min: Pogba, looking a little rusty, gives the ball away and Arsenal quickly hand it back.34 min: From the free-kick, Xhaka dinks the ball over the defensive line but it’s pretty aimless and unthreatening. A breakdown in communication perhaps.32 min: Pereira sends Guendouzi flying and goes into the book as Arsenal get on the front foot.30 min: And another. It’s Pépé this time. It’s hopeless but it still counts. He’s in a decent amount of space on the corner of the United box but wangs his effort way over the bar.29 min: What’s this? A SHOT! Pereira skitters forward, angling his run in from the right and getting defenders backpeddling. David Luiz is beaten with aplomb but his shot from the edge of the box is smartly stopped by Leno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8acbb072dc1237e888b919cf8de870fd57d54be9/0_464_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d66a3fbb1fe46482ae63b5484310c95","title":"british history can be clearly seen through spectacles","story":"Cubitts founder Tom Broughton on the story of eyewear in BritainI’m fascinated by spectacles because I’m a consumer of the product. I’ve worn them from a young age and they’re an indelible part of who I am. I’ve always liked them. My dad wore glasses too, and I remember for family photos he’d take them off whereas I’d put mine on. What amazes me is that although over two in three need spectacles, very few people know the story of them.The business of spectacles comes from the Enlightenment. Sir Isaac Newton was looking at refraction of light in the late 1600s. In 1704 he wrote a book called Opticks when he was living on Jermyn Street, London, and that paved the way for different industries including the invention of microscopes and telescopes, and the optical lens industry was another child of that moment. The industry blossomed, with key proponents including Edward Scarlett, who made the first frames in 1727, and John Dollond, who was the son of a Huguenot silk weaver who moved to Spitalfields from France during the persecution. He joined the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, who used to meet in a pub, get pissed on mead and talk about numbers. He made the world’s first achromatic lens and set up the first opticians – Dollond \u0026amp Aitchison – turning spectacles from a matter of pure science into a consumer proposition. In 1750, when the first opticians were set up, life was pretty shit. Life expectancy was 38. Glasses were seen as academic, scholarly and scientific, and they were extremely expensive, though in the early 19th century they expanded from scientific to affluent communities – and the materials used changed accordingly. Glasses were originally made from steel but that extended to rolled gold, tortoiseshell and horn. In came the lorgnette, invented in 1785 by George Adams, for wealthy ladies to whip out at the theatre. The early 1900s were the golden age of optics. Glasses could be produced more cheaply and the cost came down but they were still the preserve of relative affluence. Your glasses would be the most expensive thing you owned and your most treasured possession. As a consequence, there was an industry of repair. Timpsons shoe repair used to mend spectacles alongside shoes.The seismic moment was in 1948 when the National Health Service was established. One of its key pillars was taking spectacles to the masses. They went from being the preserve of people who could go to Clerkenwell to spend a small fortune on spectacles to being given to anyone who needed them, for free, by the state.That scheme was unprecedented: nothing had been attempted like that before in the world. Sight is still a major problem – more than 2 billion people worldwide don’t have access to glasses.It also had a huge impact on the industry. At the start of the second world war there were 200-300 different workshops across Britain making bespoke and small-run stuff. The NHS offered seven shapes of frames, and 5m frames a year. The workshops that got the NHS contacts thrived and everything else shut or combined. By 1986, when the NHS stopped offering free glasses to all, there were three companies which had the NHS contracts knocking out these stock agreed frames. Two of these three went out of the business. The third – called The Algha Works – managed to survive. They went back to traditional premium materials such as rolled gold. At their peak they employed 500 people now they employ seven.This has all left us with a peculiar relationship with glasses. British standards in optics are still stringent. We have dispensing opticians if you wander the streets of Paris you see beautiful little shops that sell glasses whereas in Japan you put your head in a machine which uses autorefractors and prints your prescription off. But the NHS scheme meant that glasses became seen as a medical device and the frames weren’t designed to look nice but to find the smallest number of frames that could fit the maximum number of heads. So spectacles became derided. When I was at school the stigma associated with them was huge. They were a sign you didn’t have money or style. I grew up in Leicester and I was exposed to a new world when I came across the brand Cutler \u0026amp Gross. When I started working and received my first pay cheque I got a pair of their frames sent up from London. It was a big deal and there was an unveiling at the opticians. The more you find out about the history of British optics, the more you realise how incredible it is. Spectacles touch on so many things – they enable your vision, they’re about manufacturing, design, phrenology, optics, materiality. The story is intoxicating.Tom Broughton is the founder of Cubitts spectacle makers "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/317_133_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0fa67de279d55c13869e4722e5e1e3","title":"naga munchetty bbc reverses decision to censure presenter","story":"Director general Tony Hall emails staff to say he is overturning ruling over impartiality guidelinesThe BBC has reversed its decision to sanction BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines with her comments about Donald Trump, following a staff uprising against the ruling and enormous political pressure.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, emailed all staff on Monday to say he had reviewed the decision following internal and external protests. He said that, on reflection, the BBC’s complaints unit had made the wrong call when they ruled against Munchetty, one of the BBC’s most prominent minority ethnic journalists, for expressing a personal response to the US president’s statement in July that four American congresswomen of colour should “go home”.Asked about Trump’s comments on BBC Breakfast, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.”The U-turn over censuring her came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence casting doubts on public claims about the complaints process made by a senior BBC executive, as he attempted to explain why Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker had escaped punishment, despite taking part in the same discussion.The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention the male presenter. “The simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role,” he said in one interview. “The complaint was about Naga Munchetty.”However, copies of the viewer’s complaint leaked to the  show that the original correspondence was explicitly about both Munchetty and Walker, leading to internal anger from BBC employees who demanded that women and minority ethnic journalists should be treated fairly by the corporation.The original complaint from a member of the public was titled “Blatant political bias from both presenters” and described Walker as “very unprofessional”, with the member of the public making clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments.The original complaint said: “Dan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump’s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump’s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally ‘furious’ about his comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It’s about time they were reminded of this.”The BBC insisted Jordan had not lied in the interviews when he said that Walker was not mentioned. They said Jordan was only referring to a revised version of the complaint, submitted by the same member of the public, which had been elevated to the corporation’s executive complaints unit. The BBC said this final version of the viewer complaint was solely about Munchetty, meaning it could not investigate Walker for his role in the discussion.On Monday night, BBC employees said the issue had reignited wider concerns about on-screen ersity at the corporation and how the BBC treated prominent senior white, male journalists differently to staff from a minority ethnic background.“People don’t care if it’s a conspiracy or not it just exposes the hypocrisy at the BBC,” said one senior journalist. “It’s come out by chance but it’s symptomatic of the arrogance of how BBC management treats women and people of colour. What’s really important is that Naga has said nothing and done nothing to encourage this, people have reacted spontaneously. This has got so big because journalists have just got together on their own and complained.”BBC journalists described growing concerns about the broadcaster’s role in an ongoing culture war which uses the BBC’s news coverage as a battleground for settling political scores, with particular concerns about a sometimes opaque complaints process that can be influenced by a single persistent member of the public.The U-turn followed several days in which the BBC management staunchly defended the original decision, insisting that although Munchetty was allowed to call Trump’s comments racist and offer a verdict on how they made her feel as a woman of colour, she could not cast aspersions on his character.The BBC had originally attempted to defend the decision, with Jordan saying it was not its role to be “calling out people for being liars or racist”.However, the corporation had come under intense political pressure to change direction, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for it to be reconsidered and Labour MP Seema Malhotra organising a letter to Hall, signed by 100 MPs, calling for a meeting to discuss the decision.Hall’s email to BBC staff explained why he had changed direction: “I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself,” he said. “It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgments.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”However, Hall fell short of apologising to Munchetty and did not address the issue of Jordan’s comments or why Walker had not be investigated for taking part in the discussion. On Friday, the BBC’s entire team of executives – including Hall - signed a public letter which backed the original decision, a position that has now been abandoned.The decision also raises major questions about the BBC’s ability to enforce its impartiality guidelines in the future, given the director general has now shown himself willing to intervene and overturn ruling by the semi-independent complaints unit in face of public pressure. The corporation’s management has been struggling to stop its journalists speaking out in a personal capacity on issues such as the Munchetty ruling and LGBT rights, with staff increasingly willing to ignore warnings from bosses to stay quiet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4186dbc8660bce2bf97e866da608918869ab65e2/190_110_2653_1591/master/2653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a672fd4dd58e632ffd8ca1860cb4f4ca","title":"peter frampton how we made baby i love your way chris kimsey","story":"‘There were 8,000 people going nuts for us in San Francisco. The band were on fire. And we ended up with the best-selling live album of all time’When I was 11, I saw this guy on the steps of our school playing sax and singing Elvis Presley songs. I asked my father – the school’s art teacher – who he was. He said: “Oh, that’s Jones.” I said: “I want to be him.” We became great friends, and “Jones” became better known as David Bowie. David used to tell a story about seeing me on Top of the Pops with the Herd and going: “That’s Peter! Why isn’t he in school?”I also played guitar in Humble Pie with Steve Marriott from the Small Faces, but wanted to lead my own band and do some singing. After my first three solo albums flopped, I was convinced the record company were about to drop me.I had three weeks off, so took my guitar to Nassau in the Bahamas to write another album, knowing it was probably make or break. I bumped into Alvin Lee from Ten Years After at the airport and thought: “I won’t get any work done now.” I don’t remember anything about the next two weeks, but after Alvin left I thought: “I’ve got a week left to write the album.”The next day I messed around with my acoustic and in about 20 minutes came up with the chords that became Show Me the Way. I had some lunch and a little swim and under a palm tree I then wrote Baby I Love Your Way. Both songs are about the girlfriend I was about to start living with. With Baby I Love Your Way, the sun was setting, so I wrote: “The shadows grow so long before my eyes.” The moonlight brought the fireflies out, so they went into the song, too.We recorded the studio version of Baby I Love Your Way in a castle in Gloucestershire, using Ronnie Lane’s mobile studio. The idea was to get away from London and the label, not that they interfered much. It was more a manor with a few turrets than a full-on medieval castle, so not too goth, but dank and miserable. There were balls and chains and armour.Quite often when anyone’s under pressure in music, you find that something special happens very quickly. Peter was listening to a lot of Stevie Wonder and was impressed that Stevie played every instrument on his records, so Peter did that, too – everything except the drums, and he’s a really good drummer!The live version is more stripped down, faster, with more electric guitar. Peter sings his heart out. He wasn’t really noted as a singer so he wanted to make his mark, and he succeeded. The energy of the live album feels as if there’s sunshine on it – Big Mountain kept that feel for their reggae cover version – whereas on our initial album version it was probably pissing it down with rain.People always ask me whether the live album was overdubbed. It was all live apart from a keyboard part we had to fix because a lead came out on stage. Frampton Comes Alive! was never intended to be a double album. Peter’s manager went: “Nobody will want to listen to the whole gig.” But, when A\u0026ampM Records owner Jerry Moss came down to listen, he said: “Where’s the rest of it?” So we had to go back in and mix the rest. After the live album came out, Peter couldn’t go out on his own because he’d get mobbed. In New York, girls would be jumping on him – not just a few but loads of them – trying to rip his clothes off. It was insane.• Peter Frampton’s new album, All Blues, is out now. His farewell tour of the US ends on 12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

That’s not true,” he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times.“If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I’ll look at a deal if there is one,” he said.Francois’ comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Boris Johnson.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.As recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May’s deal completely.Johnson has publicly said May’s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, due to go to the EU next week, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop.“My acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?” Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group.“I want nothing more than to see the sun rise on 1 November on a free country,” he said to cheers.He said his support for a deal “rather depends what’s in it … As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don’t then I will vote against it and if we don’t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.”His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as “advocating” one.She told the Bruges Group: “It would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop” but added that it would be “good to get a deal”.She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.“A period of silence will be welcome,” she said, criticising commentators in the UK, Ireland and the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760fe4028c98eefe78d85ee968ac9d9a044b4cb/13_0_3484_2091/master/3484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efa78264223268fac8c4ed296ba54e4","title":"theresa may i would rather write alpine whodunnit than memoir","story":"Ex-PM says she would like to write novel based on ill-fated 19th century ascent of MatterhornHe was the British mountaineer who led the first ascent of one of the most formidable mountains in the Alps. She was the prime minister who is likely to go down in history for ultimately failing to reach the summit of her own personal Matterhorn.Yet in her first public interview since leaving Downing Street – at a book festival in where she was asked about what book she might now find the time to write – Theresa May revealed that it was the dark rumours surrounding how four of Edward Whymper’s climbing party fell to their doom that most appealed to her.“A number of people sadly died on the way down and there is a question as to the rope that was used. Why it broke is an interesting question,” said May, to laughter from an audience at the Henley literary festival for a talk about her career and the books that had inspired her.Anyone seeking a parallel to her own ill-fated attempt to drag the Conservative party towards a difficult Brexit deal may be struck by the ’s 1865 account of the accident, in which it is reported that after the leader of the expedition decided to press on to the summit against the expectation of others in the group, one of the party slipped and dragged three others to their demise.Speaking as the Conservative party conference took place in Manchester, May did not point out any similarities, but suggested that her interest writing a real-life 19th century whodunnit set in the Alps was a combination of her love of detective novels and walking near the Matterhorn with her husband.“I suppose because we like walking in the Alps I might like to write something about that,” said May, after vigorously shaking her head when asked if she was planning to write a memoir, or had kept diaries while in Number 10.Interviewed for an hour by Olympic gold medal-winning rower Dame Katherine Grainger, nothing had changed when it came to May’s famous reticence. Her stack of cookbooks now numbered 150 but she couldn’t name a favourite. She also hadn’t read David Cameron’s recently published memoirs. Instead, detective fiction in the form of an Inspector Montalbano novel was currently beside her bedside.One of the more striking revelations about a book that had shaped her centred on Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the 1962 text that is sometimes credited with laying the foundations of the modern environmental movement.May had not read it but said that it had shaped her mother’s thinking. May said: “I know that my mother was very taken by it and it impacted on her, and that sort of fed through to me. In a sense it was quite unusual for vicar’s wife in north Oxfordshire to read a controversial book like that but I am very glad that she did.”Rather than awakening May up to a radical green agenda, however, Silent Spring seemingly had a more abstract effect of making her “cognisant of the environment in which you are operating” while also showing the impact a book could have.Adding that she didn’t believe her mother would have been “demonstrating on the streets”, May expressed regret that not enough attention had been paid to the issues raised by Carson.“I always say now that on climate change, my husband and I enjoy walking in Switzerland in the Alps and there is one particular place where over the years we have been going there we have been seeing the glacier retreating year by year and you just think: something is happening, something is changing here and we need to think about how we manage it.”Meanwhile, one of the few moments when May was questioned about contemporary controversies came when she was asked if she was surprised by the reaction to her honours list, which bestowed a knighthood on Geoffrey Boycott, the the former England cricket captain.The honour sparked controversy owing to his conviction in a French court more than 20 years ago for assaulting his then girlfriend.“Well I put my honours list together believing that there were people who I believed should be honoured in that way,” said May, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.“There was reaction in a variety of ways to my resignation honours. You just put together the names that you thought were appropriate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

The scientists behind the study have previously proposed it might have its evolutionary roots in a reflex linked to the release of eggs during sex – a mechanism that exists today in several animal species, including rabbits.Since humans have spontaneous ovulation, the theory goes that female orgasm may be an evolutionary hangover. They say the new experiment supports the idea.To explore the question the team gave 12 female rabbits a two-week course of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) – an antidepressant known to reduce the capacity for women to orgasm – and looked at the number of eggs released after the animals had sex with a male rabbit called Frank.Further experiments backed the theory that the drug was affecting ovulation through a mechanism involved in copulation and entailing the nervous system, rather than acting directly on the ovaries or other routes.The team said the results fit their theory that rabbits needed to experience something akin to an orgasm to have a hormonal surge and ovulate, although it is not known if it gives the animals sexual pleasure.They also said their theory was supported by a previous finding that animals that rely on sex-induced hormonal surges for ovulation tended to have a clitoris – the organ behind the female orgasm – in a position that meant it was more likely to be stimulated during sex.Pavličev said it remained unclear exactly how Prozac affected the reflex in rabbits, and thatfurther experiments with other animals was necessary.She added that even if the theory was right, an important question was why is the organism still there – could it be that it had acquired a different function, that there was a function on female health?Elisabeth Lloyd, a professor of biology at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm, praised the study and said it offered support for the team’s theory.She said questions remained, including whether the same muscles and nerve fibres involved in the reflex in rabbits were present in the female orgasm. She also noted that ovulation and orgasm were linked to different hormones in humans, though it was unclear why – if female orgasm had its roots in ovulation – orgasms in men and women showed so many overlapping features.Such features, she said, had generally been thought to support the theory that orgasm evolved to reward males for fertilisation, with the female orgasm simply a bonus arising from the way embryos of different sexes develop from a common form. Lloyd and Pavličev said it might be that the theories could be reconciled, with one potentially explaining the origin of female orgasm and the other indicating why it still existed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b6e97a818bf3cfd69b3bc3c8dd43cb786e364e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8bb08a2ecbf503db1c953be80c4337a","title":"downpours forensic analysis and lots of pasta on the team bus at the cycling worlds","story":" Australia was granted exclusive access to Australia’s male riders during the 2019 Road World Championships in YorkshireA decade ago, Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the pinnacle one-day race on the international cycling calendar: the UCI Road World Championships road race. Last week, Canberra’s Michael Matthews travelled to Yorkshire hoping to replicate that feat, having placed second in 2015 and third in 2017.Treacherous English conditions turned the race into an epic, pushing the best riders in the world to breaking point. As Matthews and his seven Australian teammates fought for the rainbow jersey,  Australia was along for the ride.Australia’s technical director Brad McGee is holding court. In the lounge room of a grand rural residence converted into a rehabilitation centre for police, but occupied this week by several national teams, the Australian riders have gathered. A television screen in the corner shows a weather map, with heavy rain forecast. “Will I need a raft?” quips time trial world champion Rohan Dennis.The banter stops as a late-arriving team member is chastised. The mood instantly switches, with McGee’s expression becoming stern. “Boys,” begins the former Olympic gold medallist. “Our objective is to win.” Over the next hour and a half, McGee, performance director Simon Jones, technical analyst Dr Eric Haakonssen and Australia’s eight riders forensically dissect the 285kms standing between them and glory. “Our ideal scenario is Michael Matthews sprinting to victory with seven guys leading him out,” says McGee. He pauses, and then chuckles: “That might not happen.”Matthews is among the favourites, after recently outsprinting the other primary contenders in Canada. The Australians want to control the race from the start, and Dennis is told to ride hard on the front. “We’re going for the Team Sky look,” says Mitch Docker the British outfit was infamous for its conspicuous dominance of the peloton. “It is important, visually,” he adds.The discussion is lively, each rider offering their perspective and occasionally injecting humour. A major concern is information – unlike World Tour racing, national teams are not permitted to communicate by radio. Instead, Australia are deploying a traffic light system: at each feeding opportunity, staff members handing out bottles will wear coloured strips of material. Green means “all good”, yellow is an instruction to “be careful” and red indicates “crisis”, McGee explains.Once the tactics are agreed, each rider is asked to summarise their role. Nathan Haas, Jack Haig and Simon Clarke are Matthews’ key lieutenants – it is imperative all three are still in play late in the race. “It is going to be us eight guys against 200,” says Haas. Focus eventually turns to Matthews, who has remained mostly silent. “Behind us will be mayhem,” he says. “I need all of you. It is going to be war.”Finally, the meeting concludes. “Eat well, sleep better,” McGee instructs his charges. The menu is carbohydrate-heavy, featuring pasta, rice and potatoes. “Bon appetite.”6.50am, Sunday: team bus, en route to LeedsThe team rises early, with breakfast – toast, cereal, eggs and yet more pasta – served from 5.30am. The mood is subdued, with the riders mentally preparing for the toughest day of their season. As the bus departs for the start-line, word arrives that heavy rain overnight has necessitated a significant course change. Several climbs have been removed, with two additional laps of the final circuit around Harrogate added.“I think this is better,” Haas says. “It is a race we can control.” The others seem indifferent, although a few grumble about technical difficulties trying to update the course on their on-bike race computers. Once the commotion subsides, the riders return to their inidual preparations – adding numbers to their kits, cleaning cleats, imbibing espressos from the bus’s coffee machine. Matthews speaks to his wife on FaceTime Haig consults Haas about apartment renovation plans in Andorra.The bus is greeted in Leeds by several family members – team captain Rory Sutherland’s two children have brought along an inflatable boxing kangaroo, wearing a world champion’s jersey. Technical director Jones, a Briton who has been credited with overhauling Australian cycling since joining from Team Sky, is delighted by the kangaroo and disappears with it onto the bus.The team’s support staff, all employees of Australian-registered World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, busy themselves preparing bikes, bottles and nutritional supplies. Mitchelton-Scott provided the team bus, as many other World Tour teams have for their respective nations. The blend of club and country offers an odd aesthetic Australia’s riders even have different helmets, reflecting the various sponsors of their trade teams.McGee has a final chat with his squad, but there are no rousing words of motivation. “This does not change anything for us,” he says of the late course revision. “If anything it plays to our strengths.” Outside the bus, Jones, having returned the inflatable kangaroo, exudes an aura of calm. “There is no point telling them what to do,” he says. “They’re the ones who have to do it.”The race rolls out 10 minutes behind schedule. McGee follows in the team car, while support staff scatter to different points of the route to offer bottles, feed bags and information. On the team bus, Jones has a live stream on one phone and is providing updates to the team WhatsApp group on another. Once an initial breakaway has formed, the commentator advises that, right on schedule, “Dennis moves to the front.” Jones reacts with a yell that reverberates around the bus: “Game on!”The rain becomes heavier the conditions are so bad that the helicopters which usually provide television footage have been grounded. “This is going to be such an epic day,” says Jones, with boyish enthusiasm. Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. “These blokes don’t care,” he says. “If it’s rainy, put a jacket on. If it’s windy, put your head down. These are hardened, battle-ready bike riders. The weather is not an issue.”12.57pm, Sunday: team car, on-course with 124kms to goAs the peloton enters the Harrogate circuit after four hours on-course, Dennis becomes the first Australian rider to abandon. “We are on track,” says McGee. “We completed the first half to plan, and the stage is set for a big finish.”The team car convoy is ordered by UCI’s country rankings Australia, in ninth, are well behind the back of the peloton. McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group – an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit – while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee’s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. “I’m just a little busy right now,” he offers apologetically.The downpour is unceasing. “It has not stopped raining all day,” says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. “It is like a Tour de France day in July,” the coach observes. “Except it’s wet and they have their wellies on.”More Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. “We are burning them in the right order.” Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. “Fuck,” he yells. Clarke’s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. “I got a hunger flat,” the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: “We’ve still got a few cards here.”When Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians – Matthews and Haig – remain in the front group. The team’s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. “It is pretty much all mental from here – you just have to back yourself,” says McGee.With three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at “be careful”. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. “It’s done,” he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. “We don’t have the numbers to bring it back.” McGee is visibly deflated. “There is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.”Haig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. “How the mighty have fallen,” says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia’s medal hopes are extinguished.The race is ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. “This sport, hey? Brilliant, isn’t it.” Matthews rolls across the line in 24th place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish.Back on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. “That was,” Haas says, “an experience.” After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. “I tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,” he says.Once the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year. The team take turns reflecting on their inidual performances, in the order they exited the race, before others add commentary. Docker does not mince his words: “It was fucking brutal.”The tone is broadly positive the riders feel there was little they could have done differently. McGee encourages constructive criticism, listening intently as Clarke outlines the challenges they faced receiving food from the roadside. “Is there a way we can do that better next year?” he asks.The team ponder how to overcome the conditions. “Every single person was cold,” says Haig. “It is not a coincidence that a Scandinavian won.” McGee suggests “there’s no preparing for a day like that”, but Jones is more pensive. “You can say it is down to the weather, but that’s merely a problem we haven’t solved,” he says. “Yet.”Just like the prior evening, attention finally switches to Matthews. “I want to say thank you,” he says. “Last night we outlined a plan, and today we executed.” Matthews may not be a typical leader, but his teammates are transfixed. “It was miserable out there today, but I did not hear one person complain. We stuck together – how’s that for team culture?”The other riders applaud, but Matthews is not finished. “We didn’t win, but we tried our best. Win, lose or draw, we have had an awesome day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6daca6b7057415501980d4e5b88cbb8da099ccec/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e483e1b0a5e0c3aa6584d3f8656ffc","title":"boy wins 10k race accidental kade lovell minnesota","story":"It took nine-year-old Kade Lovell longer than expected to finish his 5km race in Minnesota, but only because he was busy accidentally winning a separate 10km event.Kade’s mother, Heather, became worried when her son didn’t cross the finish line of the Francis Franny Flyer 5K in Sartell earlier this month. The St Cloud Times reports she drove along the route looking for him and found herself “bawling” when he appeared to have gone missing. “I had everyone looking for him, even a fireman,” Heather Lovell said. “I was like, ‘You need to go find my son.”’Eventually, a spectator phoned Heather Lovell’s brother-in-law, who was in the 10km race, to let him know there was a “little kid who was running really well” in the 10km event. Kade said a woman told him to keep going when he approached the 5km turn and he did, despite his confusion. “A lady told me to keep going straight. So I kept going straight,” he said.Race organizers told Kade’s mother he had won. Initially she thought they meant he had won his age group – but he was first-place overall. He finished in just over 48 minutes, a minute faster than the 40-year-old second-place contestant. “He actually probably did better than he normally does because he was trying to finish and in panic mode,” Heather Lovell said.Even though he is only nine-years-old, Kade is already an experienced runner.

They would not have been hard to spot among a crowd estimated at around 1,000 scattered around a stadium built for 40,000.On perhaps the worst weekend for athletics in the sport’s long history there seemed no end to the ways being found to insult the people who actually do the running, jumping and throwing. All the poisons to have entered the sport’s systems in recent times were pooling in the echoing emptiness of the air-conditioned Khalifa stadium.Later in the evening that same 1,000 or so watched Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the queen of Jamaica, win the women’s 100m ahead of Dina Asher-Smith, who was taking the first inidual medal for a British female sprinter since Kathy Cook in 1983. Nothing can stir the blood as profoundly and sometimes unexpectedly as athletics, and this was a wonderful race containing all the ingredients required for a memorable final of a blue-riband event.The 32-year-old Jamaican, a little ball of pure speed trailing her multicoloured hair like the tail of a psychedelic comet, was winning her fourth world title at the distance, to go with her Olympic gold medals in Beijing and London. Later she gave interviews while cuddling her son Zyon, whose birth in 2017 kept her away from the track for a year.Trailing the woman described by Michael Johnson as the greatest woman sprinter of all time by barely a tenth of a second, Asher-Smith is nine years younger and was giving notice that, barring mishaps, even more impressive achievements await as she matures and gathers experience. To look at these women in their moment of triumph one could easily imagine them to be representing a sport at the zenith of its popularity.And yet the 38,000 or so empty seats told a very different story: a tale of sickness, corruption, warped priorities and vested interests. That depressing message was only italicised when the lights dimmed before the 100m final, giving way to a hideous Vegas-style son-et-lumière, intended to impress us with the importance of the race we were about to watch. We already knew that, thank you very much. It would have been better to give these amazing women a full house to cheer them on and to award their lap of honour the reception it deserved.The way to sell athletics to a new generation is not to wrap it up in something resembling the staging of the latest worldwide tour from Rihanna or Taylor Swift. The secret of the most beautiful of sports is to be found in its simplicity and humanity. The public enjoyed the sight of Usain Bolt throwing a shape before and after a victory but it was incidental to his global appeal. What people really loved was the sight of a man sprinting faster than anyone had done before: so basic, so elemental, so pure.The pollution of that purity is something athletics has been fighting against for decades, and in particular from the day of the 1988 men’s Olympic 100m final: the one that gave its title to Richard Moore’s book, The Dirtiest Race in History. Six of the eight finalists that day in Seoul – and not just the disqualified winner on the track, Ben Johnson – were subsequently implicated in doping scandals. On Sunday night in Doha that shadow, now more than 30 years old, dimmed the spotlight falling on the men’s 100m medal ceremony. The man on the top step of the podium, Christian Coleman, recently escaped a ban for missing three drug tests on a technicality, while the doping history of Justin Gatlin, the runner-up, is too familiar to bear repeating. It was as if Bolt had never happened.Athletics is a resilient sport and there have been cherishable moments in the opening days of these world championships, as there always are on such occasions. There was Angelica Bengtsson of Sweden feeling a pole snap as she went into the take-off for her vault, then getting up and grabbing another one and setting off again to clear the bar. There was Braima Dabo of Guinea‑Bissau helping the heat‑stricken Jonathan Busby of Aruba to finish their 5,000m race, both far behind the winners. And the great Allyson Felix, another new mother, returning to win her 12th world title in the inaugural mixed 4x400m, itself a good entertainment which may or may not be destined for a permanent place in the programme.But then one remembers that two years after the lights go out in Doha the next IAAF world championships will take place in Eugene, Oregon, notable in terms of world athletics only for being the town where Nike was founded and has its world headquarters. Nike, the running shoe company who gave Sebastian Coe the contract that he was so loth to forfeit when he became president of the IAAF four years ago in succession to the man he once described as the sport’s “spiritual leader”, the disgraced Lamine Diack. Nike, the company whose negotiations with Felix over a new contract when she became pregnant started a battle over fair payment for sportswomen during the maternity period.The award of the championships to Eugene was made without transparency in any respect save that of the motives of those who also decided that it was right to hold a marathon in the heat of Qatar and were rewarded on Friday night with the sight of runners being taken to hospital in wheelchairs. One day the successors to those athletes will get the sport – and the audience – they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffb92cd53e627f5acf5e880ec16e4139b91ac23c/0_0_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9cc6e94ed101e3b65eeaa9944b6c85a","title":"world athletics championships day four live","story":"In addition to being relieved that he is still alive, Karsten Warholm was also already thinking of the work that is still to be done as his rivals attempt to usurp him.

In the future, these guys are going to be even tougher to beat so tomorrow I’ve gotta get up and work again. That’s what I love, always one more.It’s very hard to describe.

I’m gonna prepare myself for next season now.Warholm has flexed his muscles, contorted his body into a superman pose and now, of course, he is wearing his viking hat. There is surely a long, deserved night of celebrations to come.As the rest of the men stood quietly on the start line, Karsten Warholm bellowed to the camera at the beginning of the race and he attacked the hurdles with similar aggression.

The charismatic Norwegian Karsten Warholm (46.92) is the man to beat, but Rai Benjamin of the United States and Abderrahman Samba (both 46.98) will be right behind him. American Kevin Young set the world record of 46.78 in the Barcelona Olympics. How long will it stand?Daniel Stahl, the heavy favourite, wins the discus world title with a throw of 67.59m.

We’ll see if he is capable of competing with Lyles.We’ll have another packed semi-final to close things off. Britain’s Zharnel Hughes will compete against Andre De Grasse, Yohan Blake and Divine Oduduru for a place in the final.The favourite Noah Lyles just showed exactly why he is the best 200m runner by winning his semi-final in 19.86. Some impressive competition provided by Ecuador’s Alex Quinonez, who refused to let the No 1 establish a big lead and finished with a great time of 19.95. China’s Xie Zhenye took third in 20.03 and is in a good position as a potential fast loser.Adam Gemili after his great run: I think a lot of people have always talked about potential for me and I don’t think I’ve quite lived up to what people expected. It’s just another senior chance I’m at and I’m just trying to get through the rounds healthy and run my best and that’s all I can do. If I come off the bend tomorrow and everyone runs past me, then fair play to anyone. I’m just going to give it my all. Not frustration, but there’s the point to prove that I can still run and compete with these guys. And I’m happy.Adam Gemili books his place in the final by winning his semi in 20:03. Great running from the Brit, who dominated the field on the bend and established a big lead. Gemili struggled a bit in the final 30 metres or so, but a great run. Guliyev and Brown also through.The men of the 200m are on the track for the semis. We begin with a stacked semi-final including Britain’s Adam Gemili, Ramil Guliyev and Aaron Brown. This will be tough with only the first two through.In the 110 metres hurdles heats, big guns Grant Holloway and Orlando Ortega are through. Holloway of the United States, the world leader with a run of 12.98 seconds this year, won heat 4 in 13.22 seconds. Spain’s Ortega, the IAAF’s No 1, won heat 5 in 13.15 seconds. Wednesday’s semi-finals will be very open.The women’s high jump final will begin shortly. All eyes will be on neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene, who equaled her personal best with a jump of 2.06 this year. Her closest rival is Yuliya Levchenko of Ukraine, who has jumped a personal best of 2.02 in 2019. Others to cross two metres this year are Belarusian Karyna Demidik and Ukraine’s Yaroslava Mahuchikh. And that’s it.Daniel Roberts has been disqualified. Oh dear. Replays show that his trailing leg knocked down the hurdle of Ruan De Vries during the race. Hard to see that being overturned. Roberts was one of the medal favourites and recorded the second fastest time of 2019...Back on the track, Britain’s Andrew Pozzi qualifies for the semi-final in third place with a time of 13.53 in heat 3. More dramatically, race leader Daniel Roberts completely clattered the final hurdle but he stumbled over the line in first place. The ever-present Frenchman Pascal Martinot-Lagarde came through in second place and former world champion Sergey Shubenkov triumphed in heat 2 in 13.27 seconds.Britain’s Miguel Francis is out of the 200m semi-finals with a quad injury. Tough news for British medal hopes. Francis had scaled 19.97 this year with a PB of 19.88.Omar McLeod of Jamaica eases through the first 110 metres hurdles heat in 13.17. That looked promising.It’s time for the men’s 110 metres hurdles heats. The big name in the opening heat is Omar McLeod who hasn’t been in the greatest form, but who is a champion. The first four in each heat and then the four fastest losers go through. Get your strides right, people.And here is more on this shambolic world championships from Richard Williams.Here is the full schedule for tonight with timings. Of course, plenty has already happened today. Dina was just out on the track to pick up her first silver medal on the world stage. Earlier in the day, she confirmed herself as the favourite for the 200m title with the highest time of the heats, soaring into the semi-final stage in 22.32 seconds. We go on.Hello! Welcome to another packed night of athletics in front of decidedly non-packed stands.We’ll start with the men’s 110m hurdles heats, then the men of the 200 metres will take centre stage for the semi-finals. Adam Gemili soared through the heats in 20.06 seconds, with the fastest time of the round and also of his season. However, all eyes will be on Noah Lyles of the United States and his dodgy dye job as he looks to consolidate his frightening world leading 19.50 this year by reaching the final. Other challengers include Lyles’ countryman Michael Norman, defending champion Ramil Guliyev of Turkey, Ecuador’s Alex Quinonez and 100m champion Christian Coleman. Alongside Gemili, Britain have two formidable entrants in Miguel Francis and Zharnel Hughes.The finals will come fast. In the women’s high jump final, neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene is, as usual, the pick of the field as she bids to become the first three-time high jump world champion. Sweden’s Daniel Stahl threw two metres further than anyone else going into the men’s discus final. Meanwhile, the men’s 5000 metres is wide open in the absence of Mo Farah, Kenya’s Beatrice Chepkoech will be vying for the 3000 metres steeplechase title, and in the 800 metres final, Ajee Wilson of the United States will be the woman to beat. The night will conclude with the men’s 400 metres hurdles taking centre stage and, for once, it will garner all the attention as Karsten Warholm, Rai Benjamin and Abderrahman Samba, three of the four men in history to dip under 47 seconds, will resume their rivalry as they fight for gold and, just maybe, a new world record.Here’s Sean Ingle with more on a “catastrophe” of a world championships so far..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74b9fbef7521f76255f0f1c53a4fa8befb188e3/1489_3819_5050_3029/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c8d26ff5268200d5b10b00f17d33a84","title":"reykjavik standup ari eldjarn icelander comedy london","story":"The former flight attendant started standup as a dare – now he’s a sellout star. But how will his Nordic innuendos work in England?This winter, comedian Ari Eldjárn will play to thousands of people in his home town of Reykjavík. Seventeen shows in nine days in a 1,000-seat venue. It’s an annual tradition for the Icelandic standup, whose easygoing tales and punchy jokes have made him the biggest comedian in the country. But when he performed his first shows in English – two years ago at the Edinburgh fringe – he was delighted when 40 people showed up. “I had no PR, no agent,” says Eldjárn. “I didn’t know whether that was a good crowd or not. It turns out, in Edinburgh, that’s a very decent amount!”A former flight attendant, Eldjárn started standup a decade ago “as a dare”. Two of his friends gave comedy a shot and, at their second gig, invited their pal to perform too. “There was a huge appetite for comedy in Iceland at the time,” explains the 38-year-old. “I think it had something to do with the fact that the country almost went bankrupt the year before.” Eldjárn soon quit his job as a copywriter to become a full-time comedian with his friends. “We formed a group, and we’ve performed 500 times since then, selling a combined total of 90,000 tickets in 10 years.” For a country with a population of 360,000, that’s mightily impressive.In Iceland, Eldjárn has had several TV specials, sold out theatres for months on end and performed with the Icelandic National Symphony. “You think: I can’t believe I can do this bit and then introduce a piece by Mozart – and it works,” he says. “I got to conduct the symphony too, which went terribly. I did a long roast about conductors and how they aren’t really doing any work, just waving a stick. Apparently it’s way more complicated.”Eldjárn writes a new 80 minutes of material each year for his end-of-year shows. When he translates those jokes into English, ‘“it’s like a rebirth of material”.At home, Eldjárn’s stories of everyday life in Iceland are observational and relatable. Abroad, that material takes on a new educational form as he explains Icelandic living to foreigners. ‘“But it gets the same reaction – that’s the bizarre thing. You just need one line of backstory or background.”Anecdotal material is simple to translate. But some routines – especially those with wordplay – require word-by-word micro-translation. And there’s a limit to what can be converted to English. “I had a long routine about mindfulness and yoga, and that’s my favourite bit in Icelandic because it has four killer puns in a row. But it was impossible to translate!”With so much work and a huge fanbase in Iceland, it must be tempting to never leave home. But Eldjárn says it’s been “incredibly refreshing and a complete adventure” to perform in the UK. “Iceland works as a really good place for me to write and to stay active. But to go to the UK and get a good reception to your stuff – in my mind, that means you’ve made it.”• Ari Eldjárn: Eagle Fire Iron is at Soho theatre, London, 7-12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840e0d30305de73f14c67fe60af587cf619f11aa/0_157_2998_1799/master/2998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77caccdd4932944d4aa4f33680a4e528","title":"great uk activity hub win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Outdoor breaks often have a vibrant base camp offering a wide range of activities, plus advice and pit stops on hand, and a chance to socialise.

And remember, the man behind the decks does not take requests. Follow these simple edicts and you’ll thoroughly enjoy this idiosyncratic barThere are few places in Tokyo as polarising as Bar Martha. Online reviews congregate heavily around both ends of the scale and, depending which you listen to, it is either the “worst experience in Tokyo” or “brilliantly unapologetic” and “coolest place in the city”.This is no accident – few things are at this bar. Rather it is the product of the take-no-prisoners attitude of the bar’s owner, Wataru Fukuyama, a 56-year-old visionary or tyrant, according to your take on him.Bar Martha is what is known in Japan as a listening bar, where music comes first and talking a definite second. Though there are others in the city – JBS and Grandfather’s are among the better-known – Bar Martha, in Tokyo’s Ebisu neighbourhood, is further off the beaten track, patronised by Japanese audiophiles and well-dressed locals.Those who talk too loudly or disturb the atmosphere are liable to be unceremoniously thrown out. This is not a place to visit in a large group ready for loud and lively conversation groups larger than two or three should head instead to an izakaya (pub).What Fukuyama likes is music. Enter the softly lit, cavernous bar space and, after a brief explanation of the rules, you’ll be greeted by a vast wall of more than 6,000 vinyl records, which Fukuyama plays on twin turntables. Music is played across two 1960s Tannoy speakers, which Fukuyama chose for a vintage quality that sounds “akin to a rainy day in the UK”, where the speakers were originally built.“I look at the customers and think ‘who is listening?’” says Fukuyama. “Only 50 people can be in here at any one time. I often play music for the one person who is listening most intently. I think to myself, ‘How old are they? What would they want to listen to?’ I play something and watch for their reaction.”Over the course of an evening, the soundtrack shifts from mellow Ella Fitzgerald to the raucous clang of The Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go”, shifting with the flow of customers in and out of the bar. The music is never static, never dwells on one genre for too long.Nestled between and in front of the speakers are rows of high-end bottles of whisky, glistening beneath spotlights. The spirit is Bar Martha’s main focus, but the menu is all-encompassing, and ranges from draft beer through to a very enjoyable mango mojito.The 50 seats are spread between a long wooden counter (sit here to be closest to the bartenders, the vinyls and the watchful eye of Fukuyama) and more intimate hardwood tables in the recesses toward the back.All designed by Fukuyama, it is extraordinarily photogenic, but here comes the most frequent sticking point: photos are absolutely forbidden Fukuyama doesn’t use the internet and has no desire for a presence on social media. If caught, you will be politely but firmly be asked to leave or have your next drinks order refused.Certainly, Bar Martha is not for everyone, but if you’re prepared to follow the rules, it could just be the best bar in Tokyo.• ¥800 (£6) per person cover charge (added to bill), 1 Chome-22-23 Ebisu, Shibuya City, martha-recordsmarthaOscar Boyd is the travel and food editor at The Japan Times.

But the result fits into a wider continental pattern of far-right, nationalist and populist parties facing increasingly stiff political or institutional resistance and failing to capitalise on their advances in the polls to the extent that many observers had predicted.While the social and economic discontent and the dissatisfaction with Europe’s mainstream parties that fuelled their recent surge have far from vanished, the populists seem no more able than anyone else in Europe’s fragmenting political landscape to secure clear majorities for their cause.In Italy, the former interior minister Matteo Salvini, of the far-right League party, is out in the cold after collapsing the government in the mistaken belief that his soaring poll ratings meant the country wanted a hard turn to the right.Instead his coalition partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, formed a government with the centre-left Democratic party, and while Salvini will doubtless be back, for the moment the nationalists are nursing a self-inflicted bloody nose.In elections in two crucial German regions this month, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party made big gains and posted record scores, but it did not win in either and was shut out of power in both.In France, Emmanuel Macron seemed under serious threat earlier this year, shaken by the violent Saturday demonstrations of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement and the advance of the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. But the centrist president is now ahead in the polls, his approval rating at its highest since July 2018. With Le Pen failing to land a knockout blow in May’s European elections – she won by a whisker, and with a smaller share of the vote than in 2014 – and the French economy faring better than many, Macron will be quietly optimistic.In Spain, the far-right Vox party has managed to lose ground in the polls despite the failure of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to form a government and support for Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands has plummeted following infighting and isions.Far-right and illiberal populism continues to prosper in Poland and Hungary. But elsewhere in central Europe, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, is facing some of the biggest protests since the fall of communism, and the new president of Slovakia is a progressive liberal.The underlying causes of far-right populism – rising inequality, austerity, fear of immigration, globalisation, automation – remain, and the parties they sustain are fixtures in Europe’s political landscape. In several countries, far-right policies, particularly on immigration, have been adopted and normalised by both the centre right and centre left.But as the Austrian results confirm, the nationalists are not having things all their own way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/092ed5aa08fd439caaba2391337025a7ebf3694f/0_42_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe943e4873a5afac121b54732178c94","title":"foreigners filmed on state tv praising china on eve of anniversary","story":"Videos released on eve of 70th anniversary festivities feature Americans and CanadiansThe Chinese state broadcaster has released videos of foreign nationals praising the country on the eve of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, as research showed worsening perceptions in many western countries.The videos posted over the weekend show foreign citizens, identified by country, singing patriotic ballads and praising China’s culture and development. “I love you China … I love your homegrown sugar cane, that quenches my heart like milk,” sing participants, who include Canadians, Germans and Americans, in a video filmed in the eastern city of Nanjing.The video was posted by the state broadcaster CCTV with English subtitles on YouTube, which is blocked by authorities inside the country. In another video Thai citizens praise Chinese films, bridge engineering and traditional food.But a report released on Sunday by the US-based Pew Research Center showed perceptions of China had declined in the past year in countries including the US, which is locked in a bitter trade war with Beijing, Canada, Sweden and Australia.China’s president, Xi Jinping, will oversee a military celebration on Tuesday in which weapons and 15,000 soldiers will parade across Tiananmen Square.

The Comptroller and Auditor General also maintains that the Department of Education had agreed to additional conditions of sale that provided “valuable medium- term accommodation to the vendor”.It says the Department of Education “opted not to use external negotiation expertise when acquiring this site”.The Comptroller’s report says the Department of Education completed the purchase of the five-acre Roslyn Park site in Sandymount from the Rehab Group in October 2016 for €20.5million or €4.1 million per acre.The report says that in May 2016 an independent consultant engaged by the department valued the freehold interest in the property at €16.5million.It says the valuation report considered the potential continued occupation of the site by the Rehab Group for a minimum period of two years “as a weakness and reflected the impact of this condition in the valuation”. The Comptroller’s report says the Department’s offer of €20.5 million for the site in May 2016 was 24 per cent above the valuation received.“While the valuation report noted the potential for the Rehab Group to continue to occupy the site for two years, the final agreement provided for the Rehab Group to continue to occupy approximately 40 percent of the site for a further three years”, the report says.The Department of Education told the Comptroller’s office that the reason it increased its offer for the Sandymount site from an initial €12 to €20.5 million was that it had been informed by the Rehab Group that several bidders were seeking to acquire the property and that the top bid was in the order of €20million.“Therefore an offer was required to be at the €20.5 million level in order to secure the property.”The department said the arrangements agreed were on the basis of facilitating continued education provision to existing clients of the Rehab Group while at the same time guaranteeing the acquisition of the property.It said the continuing occupation of the site by the Rehab group reduced security costs which would otherwise have had to be paid while that arrangement did not have any impact on its own plans given the timeline needed for design, planning and procurement.

File image: David SleatorThe The Border village of Glaslough in Co Monaghan has been named as the winner of the 2019 SuperValu National Tidy Towns Competition.The village which hosted the 2002 wedding of singer Paul McCartney and Heather Mills was just one point behind the overall winners Listowel, Co Kerry, in 2018.This year however, Glaslough was one point ahead of its rivals, gaining 346 points in its category of Ireland’s Tidiest Village, and beating off competition for the overall award from Blackrock, Co Louth, which won the title of Ireland’s Tidiest Small Town with 345 marks.Glaslough was also just one point ahead of Ennis, Co Clare and Westport, Co Mayo which respectively won Ireland’s Tidiest Large Urban centre and Ireland’s Tidiest Large Town.Glaslough has regularly been among the competition elite and in 2018 won the title of Ireland’s Tidiest Small Village.The local Tidy Towns Committee gets to take home two trophies, for tidiest village which brought with it a cheque for €5,000, and for national winner which came with a cheque for €10,000.It was the second time Glaslough scooped the overall award having previously won the competition in 1978.Louise Duffy, Glaslough Tidy Towns Committee coordinator, said the key to success was the sense of pride in the village which encouraged so many people to take part. Ms Duffy’s son Jamie was involved in Junior Tidy Towns Committee which put together a mobile tourist information stall, while her husband Kieran “fund-surfed” for grants to restore heritage buildings and sites such as the former Great Northern Railway signal box and the “horse pond” on the Castle Leslie Estate.“There is a such a brilliant sense of pride in the village and community. It is not just the volunteers here, but the residents of the village, the community and volunteers from all the 12 organizations in the village.”Gareth Corrigan chairman of the Tidy Towns Committee said “everybody wants to get on board. It’s good craic and it is hard work. You do have fun”.Glaslough also achieved a gold medal award in the Entente Florale Europe Competition 2017. The village is located close to the borders of counties Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone. The name Glaslough translates from Irish as the “calm or green lake” in reference to the local Glaslough lake, situated within the Castle Leslie Estate. A spokeswoman for the estate described the result as “fantastic, absolutely fantastic”.John Horan of the Blackrock Tidy Towns committee said success was down to “being at it a long time”. He said the committee had gone beyond its usual efforts, and had promoted environmental sustainability including the use of electric vehicles. It also developed a park run only by volunteers, the only such park to get a green flag award.Liam Corrigan of Westport Tidy Towns said the town had won the overall title three times in the last 20 years - in 2001, 2006 and 2008. He said 2019 was the third year in a row that Westport had won the trophy for Ireland’s Tidiest Large Town. The community was pleased to “loan” the trophy back to the competition organisers every June, and get it back when the results are announced in September, he joked.Teresa McGrath of the Ennis Tidy Town Committee said the town, which missed out on the overall award by one point in 2017, put its success down “to hard work”.Presenting the awards, Minister for Rural and Community Development Michael Ring congratulated Glaslough saying the villagers were “very deserving winners”.He also announced a new fund of €1.4million to support the work of Tidy Towns committees.Martin Kelleher of sponsors Supervalu said the award was a testament to the “commitment dedication and passion” of the Glaslough Tidy Towns team."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4035490.1569873014!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"launch of rise means ireland s political left now has 15 groups and parties","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul Murphy: he says  Rise will act as a third arm of Solidarity-People Before Profit. Photograph: Getty ImagesIf ever there was a need for a new academic discipline it would be micropolitics. Its primary subject matter? Left-wing groupings in Ireland. There are many socialist organisations, but the difference between them is not obvious to the untrained eye. It is only through years of hard labour and re-education in the field that a person will acquire the ability to recognise the nuances, arcane history, and not-quite-identical tactics that distinguish them. The launch of Rise (Radical, Internationalist, Socialist and Environmentalist), a new left-wing group founded by former Socialist TD Paul Murphy, has brought to 15 the number of groups and parties on Ireland’s political left, including Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.The old joke goes that the first item on the agenda for any left-wing party is the split, and there is ample evidence to bear that out in this State. Independents 4 Change, for example, had its origins in the departure of Clare Daly from the Socialist Party.Murphy said Rise would act as a third arm of Solidarity-People Before Profit, which is made up of two distinct political parties, both Marxist and Trotskyist, and both close in many respects but destined never to join together. People Before Profit, which has three TDs, is comprised of members of the Socialist Workers Network, which used to be the Socialist Workers Party. It was formed in 1971 from disparate radical left groups and is aligned to the International Socialist Tendency.The Socialist Party was formerly a party of the militant tendency within the Labour Party in Ireland, and is affiliated to the hard-left Committee of Workers’ International, which is based in Britain. Broader coalitionsFor an outsider the easiest way to distinguish between the two parties is in their different views on Northern Ireland and Sinn Féin. People Before Profit would be seen as more tolerant of republicanism, while Solidarity regards Sinn Féin as a sectarian party. Also, they have different positions on broader coalitions of the left, with the Socialist PartySolidarity always strictly circumscribing its involvement.These were among the grounds that led to Murphy and a small group of supporters leave the party to form Rise. Murphy has been influenced by the rise of Syriza and Podemos and ground-up campaigns like that against water charges and Repeal the Eighth.Murphy sees potential for groups like his to join and influence wider parties such as Labour in Britain and Democratic Socialists of America. He is also open to co-operation with Sinn Féin and the Greens.Indeed, Rise seems not too far removed from People Before Profit, which itself has called for a broad left movement. What separates them is not easily explainable to those outside the fold."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4035152.1569854660!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paul murphy sets up new political group called rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul Murphy TD launches his new political grouping, Rise, at a press conference in Buswells Hotel, Dublin. Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe A new left-wing group called Rise has been set up by Dublin TD Paul Murphy following his departure from the Socialist Party last week.Setting out the group’s political objectives in Dublin on Monday, Mr Murphy, and four members of the new group said it would try to build a new socialist movement in Irish society.The group is aiming to develop a “green new deal” with socialist policies.It says it is anti-imperialist, anti-war, socialist, against climate change, feminist, and for the separation of church and State.“It is a new socialist group to contribute to a broader left and a cooperative left,” said Mr Murphy.Mr Murphy said it would be a group and not a registered political party and its candidates would stand under the Solidarity-People Before Profit banner, as a third arm.The group - whose name stands for Radical, Internationalist, Socialists and Environmentalist - will not field candidates in the upcoming byelections.Mr Murphy said Rise’s ambitions were modest and he did not see it as a new umbrella broad movement of the radical left.“It is not the new broad left. It is not Podemos. It is not Syriza. It is not the Labour party in Britain. It is not the Democratic Socialists of America,” he said.He said the group differed from the Socialist Party in that it was willing to build, and be active, in those coalitions.It will no longer be part of the British-based Committee for a Worker’s International, to which the Socialist Party is affiliated.The new group emphasised environment and climate change as core ideas, he said.“The environmental movement has posed important questions for socialists on how to build broader social movements,” said Mr Murphy.The group said it was necessary for socialists to participate in movements along with others who shared part, but not all, of their objectives, another key distinction from the Socialist Party.The group will take part in the Extinction Rebellion strikes on climate change and would prioritise a green new deal, which would argue for the nationalisation of key industries to achieve a zero-carbon society by 2030.Among the members of Rise are Galway activist Jessie Ní Cheallaigh who said the party’s ideology would be Marxist, and two activists from Dublin South West, Nichole McCarthy and Kay Keane. Dave Murphy, a former Solidarity spokesman is also a member.“We are very much committed to building a broader left,” he said, adding that it would continue “deep co-operation” with erstwhile colleagues in the Socialist PartySolidarity, and others on the radical left.It has no members in Northern Ireland but says it is “in discussion” with activists there and is keen to build up a presence on both sides of the Border.In a statement Extinction Rebellion said it did not align with any political party and was not associated in any way with RISE or any other political group. It said it \u0026nbspwelcomed people who voted for all political parties.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4034353.1569771333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd why nancy pelosi pressed impeach button","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi: The president ‘said the phone call was perfect . . . It wasn’t perfect.’ Photograph: Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFPGetty ImagesIt’s a beautiful day for an impeachment. Or at least an inquiry about an impeachment inquiry. So on Friday, as summer stretched on, I went to the Capitol to see what the speaker of the House was thinking, now that she has lowered the boom.At the tender age of 73, Donald Trump may finally have to face some consequences for his depredations. His casino games have caught up with him and this time Daddy’s not here to bail him out. How delicious that a woman has the whip hand. “Isn’t it something, Maureen?” Nancy Pelosi asks about what she calls her “wild week”. I nod. It surely is.“The president says you’re no longer speaker of the House, that you’ve been taken over by the radical left,” I say to Pelosi, who looks smart in a pink pantsuit and sparkly pink high heels. She laughs.“See, I always think he’s projecting. When he says, ‘She’s not the speaker of the House,’ what he really means is, ‘I shouldn’t be president of the United States. ’ When he says that Adam Schiff should resign, what he really means is, ‘I, Donald Trump, should resign.’ He knows that this is really very incriminating.”The speaker is in a fine mood, now that she’s turned her focus from reining in the progressives to reining in the president. Does she no longer think, as she said for months, that impeachment is so isive that it needs to be a bipartisan effort?“No, I said I hoped it would be bipartisan. I still hope so. It’s up to the Republicans whether they honour their oath of office or honour their oath of Trump.”I ask her how she feels about those who say she came to this moment belatedly. “I don’t come to anything belatedly,” she shoots back. “I have said from the start, we’ll go where the facts take us and we will be ready. And we are ready. And they’re shocked.”Epic tantrumTrump was clearly smarting that Pelosi is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry. Is the high-chair king about to have his most epic tantrum yet? Even Trump’s pal Chris Ruddy told NPR that the president may not understand the implications of the inquiry or that he’s going up against “the smartest person in Washington right now”, as Ruddy called Pelosi.The speaker would have preferred to send Trump packing at the ballot box. But since he keeps contaminating the ballot box, asking foreign countries to meddle in our elections to help him win, what choice did she have? The man who always claims the system is rigged against him keeps trying to rig the system – proving Pelosi’s point that Trump projects.About the White House officials who engaged in what she calls “the cover-up of the cover-up”, she notes: “You’d think that there would be some sense of decency on the part of the people who work for the president.”I ask her when the last time she talked to Trump was. “You mean the latest?” she says, laughing. “It may be the last.” They were talking about gun violence on the phone on Tuesday morning when the president suddenly changed the topic to the whistleblower complaint. “My conversation with the president was one in which he said the phone call was perfect and he couldn’t wait until I saw it because it was perfect. It wasn’t perfect.”The White House says it plans to work with Democrats in Congress even less than usual. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump met with NRA ghoul Wayne LaPierre to talk about how the NRA can chip in some blood money for the president’s defence if he stops “the games” – “the games” being any attempt to curb our periodic human sacrifices. Hasn’t Trump learned his lesson about scummy quid pro quos? It’s hard to fathom why he would slip the noose on Robert Mueller’s testimony on Russia, and then turn around the very next day and ask Ukraine to interfere in an American election.“I’ve said before, I do not have the medical background to analyse the president’s behaviour,” Pelosi says.Last tabooMaybe it’s time to break the last taboo and put a psychiatrist on staff at the White House to analyse a president’s mental state, or possible impairment?“No, I think the White House should have an honest lawyer on staff,” she says, “and not a rogue justice department.”Speaking of rogue justice and psychiatric emergencies, what does she make of America’s mayor becoming America’s nightmare?“I’m focused on the president,” she says, adding disgustedly about Rudy Giuliani: “I mean, that’s almost like a joke.”She did not arrive at her decision lightly. In between speaking at two funerals – that of Cokie Roberts, the journalist, and Emily Clyburn, the wife of the House majority whip Jim Clyburn – she talked to her members, lawyers and constitutional experts. “I had one phone call it lasted all weekend,” she says dryly. She drafted her historic statement Monday night on the plane from New York to DC.“‘Betrayal’ was a word that my members wanted me to use,” she says. “I didn’t have that in my original statement. Betrayal of the constitution. Betrayal of our national security. Betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”If only she could click those sparkly slippers three times and send Donald Trump home.\u0026nbsp– New York TimesRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000211334123_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqolbPZK5ZYrLP1KJOU5BO43efzoWKWHJ1_0ADjS0yNqE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"austria election analysis sebastian kurz must resist forming","story":"Sebastian Kurz rid himself of a troublesome coalition partner, but will he find himself in the same position again?The weekend’s elections in Austria were a shock for Europe’s resurgent far-Right.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Later, he asks a waitress if the orange juice is freshly squeezed, “like, right out of the orange? Can I bother you for a tiny sample?” Journalist Ellie Austin observes that he “swirls and sniffs” the juice “as if tasting an expensive Merlot” before announcing: “it’s a no from me.”Discussing his Instagram account and a series of topless selfies he posted to his 10 million followers earlier this year, Elgort apparently produced his phone and began to discreetly take photos of Austin, who asks him to stop.\u0026nbspWhy literary bestsellers like The Goldfinch rarely make decent moviesThe Goldfinch review: A disastrous translation of Donna Tartt’s book The Goldfinch on course to be one of biggest flops in cinema history“See, you got shy, but I’m capturing the moment,” Elgort says. “It’s a nice image. You look surreal. Your hair is done in a way that is both put-together and relaxed. Your earrings are artistic and tasteful. Your dress looks like a mother’s, so people feel comfortable. You seem sophisticated.”Austin later tweeted the online version of the interview and said it was “bonkers”.

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is currently under investigation however, we would advise that you try reconnecting at regular intervals. Apologies for any inconvenience, NatWest said on Twitter in response to complaints.A spokesperson for the bank said the mobile Bankline app is unaffected.The outage follows another incident with the app on Thursday, which showed some customers other firms\u0027 accounts when they logged in with their own details. The problem has been resolved.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe issues are the latest in a string of IT problems for NatWest\u0026nbspand its parent Royal Bank of Scotland. Last month, both bank\u0027s websites went down on the same day, leaving users unable to manage their accounts online, although the lenders said their mobile apps were still working.But IT troubles are not confined to those\u0026nbsptwo banks.Figures from the Financial Conduct Authority show UK\u0026nbspbanks suffered more than one IT shutdown each and every month in 2018, including a nine-month period when Barclays had 41 blackouts and Lloyds 37.\u0026nbspThese outages can have a long-term impact on customers. For example, scheduled payments may not go through or, if consumers can’t access their accounts to make payments, that can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office did not deny these allegations.The High Court has now granted permission for the practice to be challenged in court, with the evidence uncovered by this newspaper forming part of the basis for the challenge.The judge expressed concern about the alleged policy of collaboration with the Zimbabwean authorities and the fact that the Home Office had failed to provide any details about the practice.If successful, the judgement could force the UK government to reconsider the claims of hundreds of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers who may have been subject to this policy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

She refused to be questioned without her solicitor and was permitted to leave. In August, she was granted refugee status.Recalling the meeting, the woman, who did not want to be named,\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “The man had my file on the table. He started speaking to me in my native language. He said the British government and the Zimbabwean government had agreed to send some of the Zimbabwean people back to their country.“I was frightened, and very angry. Why was the British government allowing this person to be in their office? We are hiding here and they bring someone who I’m running away from. How can you say Zimbabwe is okay now when people are being kidnapped, tortured?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He wanted to know about my parents and relatives in Zimbabwe,” the man said.“I refused to give him information about myself. I was afraid – if they confirmed it was me, what would they do with that information? He wasn’t even concerned about whether I was an asylum seeker.”The claimant bringing the court case, a woman known only as AG, was refused asylum on the grounds that\u0026nbspwhile the Home Office accepted she was an anti-government protester, she was not of sufficient profile to attract adverse attention from government officials if returned to the country.UK orders deportation of people fleeing persecution under ‘deal’She and her legal representatives argued that the alleged Home Office policy of sharing information about failed asylum seekers with the Zimbabwean authorities “fundamentally undermined” this, as it would alert authorities to their cases.Her barrister, Rowan Pennington-Benton, said that if successful\u0026nbspthe case could force the Home Office to reassess the cases of at least 2,500 failed asylum seekers, and called on the department to provide clarity on the policy.“We need a proper explanation and therefore appreciation of the nature and scope of the agreement actually reached between the UK and the Zimbabwean governments,” he said.“Certainly, there are a lot of failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe whose cases were effectively believed in terms of being anti-government work that they were doing, but who have been told they can be returned\u0026nbspbecause they will slip under the radar.“Yet this is a policy that appears to put them above the radar, or slap bang in the middle of the radar.”UK orders deportation of people fleeing persecution under ‘deal’Home Office accused of ‘staggering’ disregard for innocent peopleCalls for review into Home Office outsourcing to ‘exploitative’ firmPaul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, who raised concerns about the policy earlier this year, said the policy contravened the principle of fair treatment of those seeking refuge\u0026nbspand put iniduals at risk of persecution.“I have received many disturbing reports from constituents over the way that the Home Office is coordinating with the Zimbabwean government, by allowing their officials to interview asylum applicants in the UK,” he continued.“All removals to Zimbabwe should be to be postponed while this political situation continues, and there are real concerns about the safety of returnees. The current Zimbabwean government should not be given this access to vulnerable asylum seekers.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Re-documentation interviews are a standard part of Home Office process where an interview is required by the receiving country to confirm identity and in order for a travel document to be produced.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They scream “You should be in jail”, then faint with shock at his far more moderate language.Labour call Tories “dirty”, “callous” or even “murderers”. Their IRA-backing shadow chancellor sniggers about lynching a female Tory.The Left cheers as a rapper waves the severed head of a Boris effigy on stage. Then they clutch their pearls when the PM pushes back.The Lib Dems scream “B***ocks to Brexit”— then demand everyone ELSE tones down their language.Speaker Bercow is right. The Commons is “toxic”. But he is blind to his blatant Remain bias helping to create it.Voters can see what this is: An organised assault to topple Boris and Brexit.Many MPs are feigning offence for effect — and for their Twitter fans. A few are genuinely upset, but only because they have mistaken their bid to reverse or ­neuter Brexit for a noble cause.It is not. Not after you have voted for a binding referendum, promised repeatedly to enact it and put the result in law.Boris calls it a “betrayal” because it is.He calls the rogue Act forcing him to beg another delay from the EU on their terms a “surrender” because it is.No, Yvette Cooper, his words are not “designed to escalate ision and hatred”. They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did. Instead they sided with a minority who refused, who chose to denigrate Leavers as thick racists, who willed them on to die, who promoted baseless conspiracies to delegitimise the vote.And who would now pour petrol on this fire they have started by forcing on our riven nation a second referendum openly rigged for Remain.That’s why Leavers feel betrayed.That’s what lies behind their rage.What excuse do Remainers have for theirs  That they lost  That one man still stands inconveniently between them and their destruction of a historic democratic mandate  That’s shameful.We deplore all the hatred and any targeting of MPs. We feel for their families.But how about some self-awareness and contrition from Remainer MPs, especially the malicious extremists of the hard-Left, about their own starring role in causing it IT is terrying to see vaccination rates for dangerous childhood diseases dropping.Some of it is parental idleness. Some is the spread of long-debunked internet scare stories.All families MUST be made to get kids their jabs before rates fall so low these illnesses can take hold.If that needs fines or exclusions, so be it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If I get my sight back I’ll never wear contacts again.As well as infections, contact lens wearers need to watch out for lenses going missing — in their eyes.Last year, one Dundee woman found shed had a contact lens stuck behind her eye for  years without realising.The unnamed -year-old went to her GP when her upper left eyelid became droopy and swollen.An MRI revealed she had a cyst, which was identied as a rigid gas permeablecontact lens lodged behind the eyelid.The woman had been hit in the eye with a shuttlecock during a game of badminton when she was .She looked for the lens at the time but couldnt find it, and assumed it had been knocked out and lost.The lens was only found by stunned surgeons during an operation to remove the cyst from her eye.Publishing the astonishing find in the British Medical Journal, Dr Sirjhun Patel and colleagues wrote: During surgery, an encapsulated cyst was found.On removal, the cyst ruptured and a hard contact lens was extracted.Make sure you always:And make sure you never:Source: NHSAnd some cases of missing contact lenses are just baffling — and revolting.In , doctors found not one, but  contact lenses stuck in the eye of a forgetful patient.Perplexed medics made the disgusting discovery while preparing a -year-old woman for a routine cataract operation.They spotted a blueish mass in the patients eye which, one closer inspection, was  lenses stuck together with eye mucus.Another  lenses were separately found in the womans eye.Speaking with Optometry Today at the time, ophthalmologist Rupal Marjaria who dealt with the case said: None of us have ever seen this before.It was such a large mass. All the  contact lenses were stuck together.We were really surprised that the patient didnt notice it because it would cause quite a lot irritation while it was sitting there.As well as prescription lenses, novelty fancy dress contacts can also pose a danger.An -year-old Canadian girl went blind for four days last year after wearing coloured contact lenses while trick-or-treating last Halloween.Emilie Turcotte woke up screaming in pain the morning after as her eyes were burning like fire.She was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her blood red eyes while she couldnt see anything for four days.They eventually discharged her and ordered Emilie to wear sunglasses for a month to let her damaged corneas heal.Her mum, Julie, told the Montreal Journal: For four days we were so scared. She could not see anything.All that for Halloween contact lenses.With Halloween just over a month away, experts are now warning party-goers about the dangers of novelty contact lenses this year too.According to Feel Good Contacts, lenses should only be worntheyre a prescription from a qualied optician and its illegal for them to be sold where.Ashish Marthur, Eye Care Expert at Feel Good Contacts said: It is advisable that you avoid buying them from street vendors, salons, beauty supply stores, boutiques, flea markets, novelty stores, Halloween stores, convenience stores or untrustworthy internet sellers."},{"url":null,"title":"demi moore one drama to another","story":"One of the many revelations was about her knickers being exposed on social media in a photo taken by her then husband Ashton Kutcher, who is said to be not best pleased about how he is portrayed in the book, Inside Out.I’m not sure Demi fully realised the impact of her “warts-and-all” memoirs, including claims that Kutcher — her much younger third husband — cheated on her and instigated “threesomes”.He’s moved on, now has a ­family with we Mila Kunis and knows that one day his two kids will read all about his behaviour during his ­marriage to Demi and find it highly embarrassing.She saw the actor,  years her ­junior, as a way to press the restart button and relive her youth all over again, but this time with a chance ofhappiness. It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They actually said, “Yes, dear.” And did.What they should have done is point out that le is tragic.Some people are born bright and some are born stupid.Some are beautul and some are not.Some have rich parents who give them everything but love.Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love.Now shut up and let them get on with it.This is how the world works.

And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.And the best business brains don’t come cheap.SAM Smith, who’s a singer I think, announced recently that “he” doesn’t consider “himself” to be a man or a woman and wants everyone to refer to “him” as “they” in future.They said on Instagram that they have been at war with themselves for . . . oh, I give up.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her body was found by the M in .Halliwell reportedly once told a colleague at his minicab firm: “Who knows what or who you will find buried out there, there could be loads of people over the years.”Another potential victim is prostitute Sally Ann John, , who vanished from Swindon in . She and Halliwell lived on the same street at the time.Tina Pryer, , Thi Hai Nguyen, , and Sandra Brewin, , have also been missing for years.And Linda Razzell, , disappeared in the Wiltshire town in .Her husband Glyn has spent  years in jail for her murder but maintains he is innocent.It has emerged Halliwell was obsessed with Linda after doing building work at the Razzells home four years before she was killed.Incredibly, the date Linda went missing in  — March  — links Halliwell, his second known victim Sian and another unsolved case. Following on the success of Manhunt, A Confession is another crime drama which deals with a real-le case.It tells the story of -year-old Sian O’Callaghan who went missing in Swindon in  after leaving a nightclub to walk to her boyfriends house.Senior Investigating Officer Steve Fulcher is in charge of handling the case and firmly believes that Sian is still alive.In the end he links Sians case to the disappearance of Becky Godden-Edwards and breaches police procedure to ensure that justice prevails.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nearly  rangers were gunned down by poachers between  and .Local poachers hunt wildle - like leopards, lions or monkeys - then deliver carcasses to ‘fronts’ owned by international crime syndicates and with links to Jihadis.Rhino horn can be more valuable on the black markets than cocaine or heroin, making the exotic animal trade the fourth most lucrative illegal activity in the world behind drugs, arms and human trafficking.Malawis poverty and corruption has made it South Africas number one trafficking route for ivory trafficking.Yet, despite massive efforts and UK funds being pumped in, no foreign national has been convicted in Malawi.From the killing fields of Zambia and Mozambique to the traffickers streaming through Malawi, we lt the lid on the illegal wildle trade which remains one of the most brutal industries in the world...The huge sums of money at stake have made poaching a lucrative trade for criminal organisations and terrorist groups.Poachers linked to the Jihadi group Boko Haram are believed to have slaughtered , forest elephants in a single region of Gabon over  years – leading to the deployment of British troops to the region in .Shocking images of a mutilated elephant corpse show sick poachers often cut the animals head in half to remove its tusks.Other elephants and lions have ended up maimed by metal traps laid out by poachers.Lions have become a target recently because so many rhinos have been wiped out and the big cats are easier to poach because they scavenge which means poachers can poison them with meat before hacking off their faces and paws.“If you take out the word wildle and think about it in terms of crime and its value to a country, these resources – be it for tourism or whatever – are being lost,” says Mary Rice, executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency.“It’s a hugely serious criminal activity and it’s highly likely that some of these iniduals are involved in other trades, like firearms and money laundering. It’s all interlinked.”As well as being barbaric, the poaching trade is forcing many species towards extinction.Over the last  years the global number of black rhinos has dropped from , to ,, while the African Rhino could disappear by .Scaly anteaters called Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal because of their hides and meat, and are particularly vulnerable as they curl into a ball when threatened.Over the last  years alone a million have been taken from the wild - in another  they could be completely gone.After the animals have been murdered, their hides and bones are cut into small bits, put in containers and moved through neighbouring countries where border police have been paid off. This is known as ‘owning the road’.Eventually, they make their way across continents to Asia, where there is a high demand in countries like China and Vietnam for ivory goods, furs and ornaments. Ivory is even ground into a powder then sold as Chinese medicine.Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles led an international wildle conference in  to highlight the problem of poaching, with Charles warning there wasnt a moment to lose when it came to protecting endangered animals.It led to the total ban on trading ivory in the UK - regardless of its age - last year, while in Malawi the government also toughened up laws.Five years ago, the average punishment for poaching in Malawi was a £ fine – in  it was a five-year jail term.The country has also pumped money into new investigation units, in part thank to UK funding, leading it to become the ‘golden child’ of the conservation world.Javier Montano, from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, says a multi-agency approach is critical.Wildle trafficking needs to be treated as a serious crime, he says. “We hope that Malawi’s strong efforts in addressing and combating illegal wildle trade to date are reflected in the courtrooms in the coming months.”And it seems that might be the sticking point.Malawi has been linked to record hauls in Singapore, China and Australia, but is yet to convict a single foreign national caught trafficking.In contrast, neighbouring Tanzania jailed four Chinese smugglers for  years for rhino smuggling.“What we’re seeing is they track down these syndicates and networks and they use the full force of the law to arrest them,” says Rice.“But then corruption creeps in. We see some of these iniduals who should be receiving strict sentences being let off with lenient penalties.Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed every year for their ivory tusks.The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery – China is the biggest consumer market for such products.The ban on international trade was introduced in  by CITESafter years of unprecedented poaching.In the s, an estimated , elephants were being killed per year and up to % of herds were lost in some regions.The ban allowed some populations to recover, especially where elephants were adequately protected.But there has been an upsurge in poaching and illegal ivory trafficking in recent years, driven by increasing demand in Asia, which has led to steep declines in forest elephant numbers and some savannah elephant populations.Insufficient anti-poaching capacity, weak law enforcement and corruption undermine efforts to stop the poaching and trafficking in some countries.Source: WWFIts hoped this could change as the country awaits the sentencing of an alleged wildle trafficking ring led by notorious ivory kingpin Yun Hua Lin, .Ten Chinese Nationals and four people from Malawai have been charged with possessing rhino horn, ivory, pangolin, hippo teeth and firearms.We have capacity issues, but so far Malawi is becoming a safe home for wildle, Brighton Kumchedwa, director of the Department of National Parks.These arrests are now sending a strong message that we are no longer a playground for wildle trafficking.Rice agrees that country has in many ways become a success story, but warns nothing can be taken for granted.I think they still need that eye on the country to help the government, prosecutions and NGOs to help get beyond the corrupt elements, she explains.“So it’s a really good opportunity with Prince Harry visiting.He’s done a lot to help raise the profile in the country but it’s still really grappling with the problem.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has become its human embodiment and has to be stopped.“We’re going to throw everything at bringing him down.”He faces an ambush as he speaks at the Tory conference in Manchester this week.Scottish Nationalists and Labour could table a confidence vote with the aim of installing a stand-in PM.Mr Corbyn still insists he should get first bite at leading a government of national unityMr Johnson is toppled.It comes after Mr Johnson was denied a recess to hold the conference as opposition parties claimed it was too soon after his Parliament shutdown.MPs ed to the chamber  last week after the PM’s suspension of Parliament - originally meant to be five weeks - was ruled to be unlawful by  Supreme Court judges.The case had been brought to the highest court in the land in a legal challenge by Remainer lawyer Gina Miller and former Tory PM, Sir John Major.Mr Johnson had argued that he suspended Parliament to push through a new domestic legislative agenda with a Queens Speech.But Remainer MPs said it was to avoid scrutiny over his Brexit plans - in particular No Deal.A humble address is a direct call from the House of Commons to the Sovereign to request the government produce documents.According Parliamentary Practice, a rulebook published in the th Century, the humble address is more binding than a simple opposition motion.That is because it is an appeal to the head of state, rather than to the government who could otherwise choose to ignore it.Speaker of the House John Bercow said such motions were “traditionally regarded as binding or effective”.It was used by Labour in November  to force the government to publish  studies on Brexit.The research had been commissioned for ministers who had fiercely opposed them being made public — leading opponents to believe they may contain information embarrassing to the government."},{"url":null,"title":"model bit womans leg newbury races","story":"Eliza Peereboom, , is accused of savagely biting a woman stranger above the knee so badly she was left permanently scarred and needed three months of Tetanus injections.Peereboom, of London, became involved in a row on the station  at Newbury, Berks while travelling on the train to Reading, the court was told.The model, who denies pulling the hair of racegoers Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield and causing actual bodily harm to Gabriella Marabet, watched as a jury was shown  minutes of CCTV train footage from August  last year.Prosecutor Emily Lauchlantold Reading Crown Court: Everyone involved had been making their way home from Newbury racecourse.

Joanna Brett said she felt like crying by the way son Sebastian, who has undiagnosed gross motor delay, was treated at the theme park in Windsor at the weekend before going on the Ninjago ride. She claims staff said Sebby had to prove he was able to walk aposthree stepsapos while holding her hand in order to prove that he could safely be evacuated in an emergency or would be refused entry. She said: It was pretty horric. Weaposd gone in via the wheelchair entrance and we went to the front of the ride. But someone came up to us and said that Seb needs to demonstrate that he can walk three steps or he canapost go on. And he was only allowed to do it holding on to one of our hands because itaposs their evacuation policy. I thought it was ridiculous, heaposs in a wheelchair.  So we managed to do it, we got on the ride but another staff member came up and said that we needed to do it again. Itaposs hard work for him, I didnapost knowhe could do it again. But he did it again, in front of everyone, whilst the ride was delayed. It was obvious that we were the reason for the delay. It was just so embarrassing.  Now the mum-of-two has told how bubbly Sebastian was left upset following the incident, which saw them stay in the resort hotel overnight. She said: My son is the chattiest person in the world, you canapost talk when heaposs around you. And he just went quiet, which meant he was upset. Throughout the whole process, he didnapost say anything. And then in the lt on the way back down, he asked aposwhy did they make a disabled person walk  It really upset me, it was really hard.apos He mentioned it quite a few times yesterday but we tried not to focus on it. He met Lego Batman which made him feel better but for a while he was quite quiet. Weaposre hoping that it doesnapost spoil the experience, weaposre hoping that he remembers that he did get to go on the Ninjago ride, because it would have been upsettinghe hadnapost. Joanna added: One of the issues is that Seb was tested in front of people. And the staff were terrible, it wasnapost their fault, they just havenapost been trained.  The problem was with the way they spoke over him instead of to him. If they felt itaposs necessary to test him, which I donapost believe it is, why donapost they do it at the beginning of the day and give him a pass  More to the point, why isnapost a park inclusive in this day and age  How can Lego, a massive company, be so lacking in disability inclusion  I understand health and safety and not everything can be accessible, but for so little to be accessible is shocking.  Now Joanna has called on staff to be retrained as she said the experience left her son devastated alongside daughter Lottie, , and her husband. The family decided to go on the trip, from their home in Gloucestershire, after Sebastian had four operations within twelve months. But Joanna says they were not warned beforehand that he could not access many of the rides. And the family-of-four avoided the policy for the rest of the trip by ditching the wheelchair before queueing and carrying Sebastian instead. She said: We just thought him and his sister needed a treat.

The immortal “I don’t believe it!” uttered by actor Richard Wilson in the hit sit-com saw off meerkat Aleksandr Orlov’s “Simples” from the Compare the Market ad. Dad’s Army classic “Don’t panic” made famous by Lance-Corporal Jones, played by Clive Dunn was the third best loved. And Del Boy’smuch mimicked “Lovely jubbly” and “Rodney, you plonker!” from Only Fools and Horses both made the top .    The study found more than half of adults think the best expressions come from TV shows with one in five saying reality TV had the most popular catchphrases. According to the King’s College London study, on average Brits use a catchphrase three times a day and three in ten admit to peppering their conversations with well known phrases from their favourite shows. Experts say the perfect catchphrase is four words long, has to be heard at least four times to register in the brain and must be easy to repeat as well as funny.  The survey of , adults found a third of people use a popular phrase without knowing its origin with the pub the most likely place to drop it into general chit-chat. Tony Thorne, language consultant at King’s College university, said: “Catchphrases are a key component of popular culture as they connect the world of entertainment and consumption with the everyday concerns of real people - their feelings and experiences, their shared pleasures and their struggles and frustrations, and especially their triumphs over adversity. “Catchphrases derive their power from compressing complex ideas into short, snappy sequences.  “A catchphrase such as ‘I don’t believe it!’ expresses a mix of exasperation, world-weary resignation and fatalistic humour that will be familiar from many people’s personal experience.” The poll put “It is what it is” made famous by Love Island’s Sher Lanre, , just outside the top  at number  while The Daleks’ “Exterminate!” in Dr Who was at number  and comedian Micky Flanagan’s “We’re going out-out” made . .

The Loose Women star and the former Sky News paper reviewer revealed themselves at their most vulnerable in a bid to demonstrate to others suffering in silence that it really is OK not to be OK. Soundbites and campaigning on the issue are one thing. It is quite another to reveal the naked truth about just how weakened, dismantled and utterly defeated you are left feeling on a day to day basis. “How I describe it is the colour goes out of my le and people I am around that I love being with I don’t want to be around,” said Welch. Fty-year-old comedian Royce – a former warm-up man for The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent – is fighting to overcome alcohol addiction. He suffered a brain aneurysm when drunk and at one time attempted suicide. “My name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic…holding my hands up… for help. There I said it and own it,” he posted on Twitter.

Mum Kelly Parfitt claims surgeons ranked the nine-year-oldaposs injuries as a . out of  on an injury severity scale. The little girl has been left unable to hear out of her right ear or close her right eye fully, with  stitches needed to close the wounds on her face. Lily-Fay will be scarred for le her mum said, with her two younger brothers who witnessed the attack left traumatised by the incident and terried of unfamiliar dogs.    Mum-of-five Kelly is warning people that all dog breeds can be dangerous and to keep pets on short leads around children. Kelly, from Southwater in West Sussex, said: Itaposs le changing for Lily, she canapost smile as sheaposs lost her lips. What I can see of her lip at the moment is that itaposs really jagged, like a jigsaw piece. Weaposve taken all mirrors down and covered the one in the bathroom up so she canapost see her reflection.    I think sheaposs going to be shocked because sheaposs very into photos and selfies. I feel like Iaposm in a daze, itaposs like Iaposm in a dream. I think Iaposll wake up and it will be a bad nightmare but clearly itaposs not going to happen. Itaposs still so raw. Lily has been so brave. Sheaposs also having night terrors. She wonapost go anywhere without me at all times. Sheaposs doing alright, but I donapost think itaposs hit her yet. Itaposs all covered up so she canapost see it. Whencomes off is when itaposs going to seem real to her.    Kelly was supervising Lily-Fay while she played with her cousins and siblings after school on her auntaposs farm in Pulborough, West Sussex. Full-time carer Kelly noticed a dog owner had left their pet tied up. The dog made a beeline for Lily-Fay and launched an unprovoked on the girl, Kelly claimed, biting her mouth and cheek. Kelly said: Lily saw the dog and stopped and turned, she didnapost even step towards the dog.    Lily didnapost even make a beeline and go running towards it, she stopped in her tracks and turned towards the dog - we werenapost that far away. The dog actually came straight to her. I heard an ear-piercing scream as it grabbed her top lip and tore out her cheek, leaving catastrophic wounds. My mum got to her before I did because I had her baby brother in my arms, she told me aposdonapost come nearapos and pushed me away. The injuries to Lilyaposs face is something that I never want to see again. Her top jaw, her top teeth, her tongue and bottom jaw had been degloved.    Lily-Fay had  stitches on the outside of her cheek to hold it together,  stitches in her lip and an unknown number inside her cheek. The dog took off so much skin that the young girl lost  percent of her top lip. Surgeons were concerned that stitching her up too tightly may leave her mouth drooping. It was the th time Lily-Fay has been under the kne, because she was born with a rare birth defect whcih means she has a horseshoe-shaped kidney and just  percent of her bowel. Despite now facing three weeks off school to prevent infection, the youngster is determined to keep up with her school work and Kelly claims she even managed to smile again last week. Kelly said: The surgeon took one look at her and said apositaposs le changing, we donapost knowshe will get senses back because of the severity of the injuryapos.    She has slight hearing loss out of her ear which we donapost knowit is going to come back. She canapost close her eye fully at night time, so theyaposre going to put eye drops in to stop her eye from drying out. Sheaposs already had so much going on in her little le as it is, sheaposs doing really well. The incident was reported to Sussex Police and Kelly claims the dog has since been put to sleep.

She signed up to Slimming World and, in  months, has lost more than  stone. The mother, of Tavistock, Devon, was told she could still eat all the food she loved, including chicken nuggets, and the weight started to drop off. Mandy realised the meal plan could easily be adapted to suit family le and she could eat everything from pizza, roast dinners, curry and even chicken nuggets and chips.    With the hundreds of free foods available it really can be adapted to any lestyle, the diabetes research nurse said. It really is so easy to follow as itaposs not a diet it is a well balanced healthy eating plan that encourages long term intrinsic lestyle changes. The best bit about Slimming World is nothing is banned. If I want to enjoy an ice cream on my day out with my little boy then I can. Slowly I kept swapping my food choices and increasing my physical activity and before I knew it I had easily embraced a whole new lestyle. My confidence was slowly building and I went from wanting to hide behind baggy clothes and  smiles to genuine happiness and clothes that showed off my new forming figure.    Mandy, who now weighs . stone, had struggled with her size since childhood. I was a chubby child and on the larger side as a teenager, she told Okehampton Times . As an emotional eater food has literally been my crutch and one that I have relied on heavily. As a teenager, I was subjected to bullying because of my weight and this only served to fuel my emotional eating and the weight slowly kept creeping on. Despite trying everything from hypnotherapy to diet pills, and milkshakes to restrictive diet plans, the mum found it tough to tackle the flab. She also had a setback when her husband was diagnosed with incurable kidney cancer. He was forced to have surgery to have his kidney removed, along with a separate operation for a hernia repair. And despite the pain of seeing her husband going through such a horric ordeal, her group managed to keep her on track with her diet.

One of the most dangerous years of your le is the year you retire because you experience a sudden lack of purpose.” Have regular hot baths As well as helping to relax muscles, a Japanese study by Ehime University in Matsuyama found that regular hot baths are linked to better heart and circulatory health.Those who took at least five a week had lower markers of atherosclerosis . Eat like an Italian The Mediterranean diet is great for heart health, reduces the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer, and is ideal for sustainable fat burning and lean muscle gain, say scientists at Sheffield Hallam University. This diet always wins praise from nutritionists.  Stay close to family and friends In Okinawa, a Japanese island known as “land of the immortals” due to the number of centenarians, residents set up friendship groups known as ‘moai’. The term means ‘meeting for a common purpose’ and originated as a way for villagers to support each other in times of need,” explains Dan Buettner. Studies consistently show that social ­isolation is associated with several chronic health conditions. Get outside every day Even with the increased risk of skin cancer, those who enjoy the sun are less likely to die young than shade-seekers, say Swedish researchers who monitored , women over two decades.

The Chernobyl nuclear disaster saw a series of explosions and a subsequent fire at the fourth reactor, releasing radioactive fallout into the surrounding countryside. More than eight million people were exposed to elevated levels of radiation as a result of the continent-wide crisis which took place on April , . Eerie footage shows how the high-tech instrumentation that once operated the Soviet power plant have been left to gather rust. The destroyed control room - once a hive of activity - lies totally empty with few clues as to its vaunted former status. Humans are rarely allowed to enter the area which still emits , times higher levels of radiation than natural environment.    The clip, taken inside the control room in Ukraine, shows the remains of what is still thought to be the worst civil nuclear accident in human history. A group of  journalists gained access to the Unit  control room last Wednesday as part of the presentation of a new guide book on the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Tourist will also get the chance to visit the irradiated remains of the control room, although protective suits, masks and industrial boots need to be worn. They will be able to observe the room for only five minutes because of the deadly radiation.

Rangers had  shots with  of them on target.Only the heroics of keeper Joe Lewis prevented a depressing defeat from becoming an embarrassing slaughtering.That the keeper was the standout man of the match in a five goal humiliation tells its own depressing story.Instead of going for a fourth win in Glasgow in a year, this became more an exercise in damage limitation. Yet still there was signicant damage inflicted.This was concrete confirmation of a sobering reality that normal service appears to have been resumed in Scottish football as to the domination of Celtic and Rangers. The Glasgow two look set to dominate the Premiership with teams like Aberdeen battling it out for third – at best.This completed a bad week for Aberdeen. They were terrible at Livingston but ground out a win.They blew a League Cup semi-final slot by conceding an equaliser in injury time and imploding in the penalty shoot-out.Aberdeen gave Rangers too much space by lacking the necessary aggression. Steve Davis and Ryan Jack dictated the game.Had the tenacity of injured Craig Bryson been available and the ball recycling of Funso Ojo the Dons will have been stronger to face a Rangers side clearly desperate to gain revenge for those three losses in Glasgow.Rangers dominated early possession, and had shots go wide from Morelos, twice, and Greg Stewart in the opening quarter hour.An inevitable opener came in the th minute when Morelos broke into the box and was brought down by Zak Vyner.Referee Bobby Madden awarded a penalty which James TAVERNIER blasted past Lewis.Moments later Morelos rounded Lewis before shooting from  yards but Mikey Devlin was placed to clear off the line.The overworked Lewis then saved from Sheyi Ojo and blocked a Scott Arfield  yard drive. It was - in the th minute when Arfield met a Tavernier cross but Lewis brilliantly pushed the header onto the post.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU.

The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Millions of people in more than  countries will walk out of their work, homes and colleges and spend a day demanding action on the climate emergency.I hear that many in Lochgilphead High School are planning to do the same # well done!Let us join them on Friday September  between am and pm to help build a future fit for all living beings.Mary Stirling, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"special year for lochgilphead swi","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Scottish Women#s Institute ladies are celebrating the group#s th birthday this year.A special meal attended by guests from other institutes and the Scottish president Linda Retson will take place in December to mark the occasion.The group#s new session starts on Tuesday September .

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go. Head girl Eilidh Logan designed snazzy posters to go around the school and the bags poured in.Michael concluded: #Collecting crisp bags is just so easy to do, and we are supporting recycling, prevention of littering and charity benefits too.#If you want to donate crisp bags, there are a number of collection points around Mid Argyll.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area. However, it must be stressed thata patient needs to see a healthcare professional urgently, then they will do.ldquoWe appreciate that change in the way services are provided can take a period of time to settle in however, we know from patient feedback that we are getting it right, and this is reflected by the fact that we have received complaints from only . per cent of patients this year.ldquoWe know that the signicant majority of our patients have a positive experience of healthcare through Riverside."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-full-praise-ridge-visit","story":"Aileen Campbell MSP, cabinet secretary for communities and local government, paid a visit to the town.She was met by staff and volunteers from The Ridge, who spoke about their work at the Backlands Garden site.Volunteers also spoke about how The Ridge and its services had impacted on their lives.Ms Campbell was also impressed by the work being carried out by the Ridge Foundations team, who are currently restoring the Black Bull Close buildings that sit at the head of the gardens.Until recently, the buildings had lain in ruins, in real danger of being lost forever.While under restoration and looking forward to a more useful future, the buildings now act as a training environment for the Ridge Foundations trainees and apprentices, as they learn and hone their new skills in masonry and joinery.The MSP said: ldquoVisiting The Ridge gave me an insight into the wide range of projects and support they provide, including the Backlands site, the Hungry Hatch Cafe and the exciting restoration work at Black Bull Close.ldquoThese projects provide great food, green spaces to enjoy and improve Dunbar as a place to live and visit.ldquoThis innovative enterprise also provides local people with opportunities for training, employment and volunteering and helps improve health and wellbeing.ldquoThe success of The Ridge is a testament to the dedication of staff and volunteers, transforming peoplersquos lives and physically regenerating the heart of Dunbar.A spokeswoman for The Ridge was ldquothrilled to welcome the politician.She added: ldquoAs an organisation, we are deeply embedded within the community and believe passionately that everyone has a really valuable contribution to make.ldquoWe are committed to providing opportunities for people to overcome barriers to achieving their full potential.ldquoMs Campbell could see and understood how the many Ridge offerings provide a holistic environment for those more vulnerable members of our community to thrive."},{"url":null,"title":"project-restoring-historic-tranent-shopfront-former-glory","story":"The Buttercup Dairy company was founded by Edinburgh mogul Andrew Ewing, with the first branch opening in  in Kirkcaldy, and it soon became common all over Scotlandrsquos central belt.The company was famous for its distinctive and extravagant shop fronts and it lasted for  years before its final shop closed down in .Tranentrsquos branch of this iconic dairy was at - High Street, and the intact shop front was discovered by local beauticians Simply Smooth.A grant was given by Regenerate Tranent to repair and restore it to its former glory.Gareth Jones, the architect managing the project, presented a social media video on the progress made by the team.He said that there was some damage from boarding up the shop front for so many years, indicating the drill holes in the tiles however, most of the tile work has survived and the plan is to restore, rather than replace, as much as possible.It is not just the aesthetics that the team will be dealing with ndash work on the roof and chimney will ensure the building is weather proof.Lucy Schofield, Tranent regeneration scheme officer, said: ldquoWersquore really excited and happy with the repair works.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"face-face-glasgow-born-downton-abbey-composer-john-lunn","story":"But there are some days when the -year-old Scot really does feel a little giddy at it all. One came earlier this month when he was flown to New York and, suited and booted, invited to walk the red carpet at the star-studded US premiere of the film version of Downton Abbey, everyonersquos favourite Edwardian upstairs downstairs romp.ldquoIt was spectacular, he says, still sounding a little awestruck. ldquoThey had a fantastic party afterwards in the Plaza Hotel, opposite Central Park. I still do pinch myself a little bit, I have to say.Lunnrsquos compositions have been a staple of Downton Abbey since it first aired in . He has scored each of its six series as well as the film version, which is set in  and finds the Crawley family entertaining King George V and his we Queen Mary. It was for his work on the blockbuster series that he won the two Emmys, the first in in , the second the following year. It also brought him a Royal Television Award for Best Score though in its way the accolade bestowed on him by Classic FM is perhaps most telling of the lot: in a  listenersrsquo poll of the best TV theme ever written, Lunnrsquos Downton Abbey Theme came top.Looking back, Lunn admits to being ldquoquite surprised at how well liked Downton Abbey was when the first series aired .ldquoI thought it would do well because the production values really were pretty high, it looked good, there was some great acting and it was well written, he says. ldquoBut like everybody  I was a bit surprised that the subject material would prove to be so popular. Irsquod done things like Little Dorrit [] and Bleak House [], Dickens adaptations which were enormously successful here and in America, and I thoughtit does as well as either of them, thatrsquoll be great. Irsquoll be perfectly happy with that. Little did I know it would eclipse both of them by some distance.But while nobody now doubts the power of the series on the small screen, it still wasnrsquot a given that it would translate well to the multiplex.ldquoWhat everybody was concerned about was whether we could motivate an audience who was used to seeing it on a Sunday evening to go to the cinema, says Lunn. ldquoBut amazingly, that seems to have happened.And how. When the film was released in the US it beat both Brad Pittrsquos Ad Astra and Sylvester Stallonersquos Rambo: Last Blood to top the box office, taking  millionin its opening weekend and setting a new record for what industry bible Variety terms a ldquospecialty studio . The reviews werenrsquot bad either.Lunn has lived most of his adult le in London but he was born in Glasgow in , grew up in Bridge of Allan from the age of five and attended Stirling High School. Although born to musical parents ndash his father had played in a jazz band in the s ndash he came late to playing music himself.ldquoBecause my father had been a sax player there was a lot of music in the house. At the age of  or  I was kind of absorbing it all and I got into a lot of the rock music that was around then, like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. My dad suggested I take up an instrument and I heard Paul Tortelier playing the cello on the television and thought lsquoThat sounds quite interestingrsquo.He asked at school and was told there was no chance of cello lessons, buthe wanted he could try the double bass instead. He decided to give it a shot. He was  at the time, quite old to be taking up an instrument.ldquoAs soon as I started I just knew. I got really good at it really quickly. I took up piano lessons about six months later and after that nobody could stop me. Nobody had to tell me to practice.ldquoTo be honest, I think I was a bit unhappy before that. Those early years at secondary school are quite dficult and I didnrsquot quite know where I fitted in. I was scrabbling around looking for something to hold on to and music provided that in abundance. I just went with it.His next move, then, was a no-brainer: Glasgow University where, aged , he studied music and threw himself and his double bass into the cityrsquos music scene. At one point he played in a band with Craig Armstrong, now also a noted composer of film scores.In  Lunn was offered a publishing contract with Chrysalis Records and moved to London. He has lived in the city ever since. For a few years he became, as he puts it, ldquoa bit involved in pop music but his preferred outlet was a series of bands he describes as ldquoexperimental. The most notable was Man Jumping, an electro-jazz fusion group signed to EG Records, also home to Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and Penguin Cafeacute Orchestra.He wrote his first score for television in , for a BBC play called The Gt, and throughout the early s he continued to write for long-forgotten series such as Backup and The Ghostbusters Of East Finchley. Then, in , came his big break: Hamish Macbeth, an amiable BBC drama following the le of a policeman in rural Scotland.Filmed in Plockton, it ran to three series and proved an unlikely hit. Lunn wasnrsquot the only one involved who moved on to bigger and better things. Robert Carlyle had the title role andyou scan through the credits yoursquoll also find Shirley Henderson and Alastair Mackenzie as well as Skins creator Bryan Elsley and Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, in a rare writing role.Today, Lunn isnrsquot the only working composer with the Midas touch. But since that first major commission his CV has been peppered with landmark productions, many of them period pieces. There was The White Queen, nominated for a Golden Globe in . There was Bleak House, nominated for  Emmy Awards and winner of the Best Drama Serial award at the  BAFTAs. There was Burton And Taylor, which starred Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter as the starring battling couple and which picked up a clutch of award nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. There have been many others.With his own Emmy wins and the higher profile they brought, Lunn would have been well placed to make the move to the US. Was he ever tempted  He had plenty offers, he says, but he turned them down.ldquoIt was a dficult period for me to have gone over to America because both my kids were in secondary school and they were quite happy where they were. I was getting plenty of work here and anyway six months of the year was taken up doing Downton.It hasnrsquot proved to be a mistake. Among Lunnrsquos recent compositions are the soundtracks for BBC Scotlandrsquos police series Shetland Sky Onersquos historical drama Jamestown, set in  in the American colony of the same name and, for Netflix, The Last Kingdom, an adaptation of Bernard Cornwellrsquos Saxon Stories, set in England in the Dark Ages.Hersquos particularly proud of the last one, a collaboration with genre-spanning Faroese singer Eivoslashr Paacutelsdoacutettir, also known for her work with composer Gavin Bryars.ldquoI think what wersquove done for The Last Kingdom is possibly about the most original thing Irsquove done, he says. A long way from the Downton Abbey soundtrack, which he describes as being ldquolike a combination of Coldplay and Philip Glass, it relies almost entirely on his studiorsquos battery of analogue synthesisers, though there is one other element: for the first time, he has found a use for that gong.Downton Abbey: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is out now Best trait  Irsquom fairly calm, even in a crisis.Worst trait  Yoursquod have to ask my we, but possibly some level of hypocrisy!Last book read  The Road To Wigan Pier by George OrwellLast film watched  Irsquove just finished Chernobyl and I thought it was brilliant.Whorsquos in your fantasy rock group and what do you play  Itrsquos not exactly rock but Irsquod have loved to have been Miles Davisrsquos bass player between  and  playing alongside the likes of Keith Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin etc.Best advice received  Study at Glasgow University, given to me by my head of music at Stirling High School, Mr. Melville.Ideal dinner party guests  Nicola Sturgeon, Billy Connolly and Brian Eno"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Traitor  Liar  The Commons is becoming more like Twitter than Twitter","story":"Some pundits were saying that this unrestrained, aggressive style of political debate began with the  Scottish referendum. But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow.

When he did, he would sometimes wish he had a ldquobefore photograph of a pristine never-dredged bed. What he found and photographed in Norway ndash though dferent in texture from the Scottish seabed of his memories ndash seemed almost like that. ldquoI say to a lot of people, Irsquod like to show you a lsquobeforersquo and lsquoafterrsquo, but on the west coast of Scotland therersquos no area that shows lsquobeforersquo, he says. ldquoEvery inch in the sort of grounds where the scallops are has been towed over  times by dredgers and bottom trawlers.At first, Stinson was unaware of Norwegian restrictions around dredging and trawling and wasnrsquot sure why their seabed should be so dferent to ours. ldquoIt was only when I saw a set of scallop dredging gear and somebody said it had never been used because it had been prohibited that I started asking more, he says.The Norwegian government has prohibited scallop dredging and bottom trawling within  nautical miles of the shore, with some exceptions. Such restrictions werenrsquot put in place for conservation reasons ndash but to manage what are called ldquogear conflicts, between those towing mobile gear and others with static nets.Norway also has a  Marine Resources Act, at the heart of which, according to Per Sandberg of the Norwegian fisheries agency Fiskeridirektoratet, is ldquoan ecosystems approach to fisheries, as well as a ldquoprecautionary one.ldquoIn general, we are concerned that the fishery should not harm the environment, he explains. ldquoIn the s and s, there wasnrsquot too much concern that we were fishing too much ndash the idea was that the ocean was plentul. But then, suddenly, we got the collapse of herring. It took us  years to regain stock. One lesson learned: you need to manage the resources.Stinson rails against the use of ldquomobile gear, a term for dredging and trawling equipment towed behind a boat, which in Scotland can be used right up to the shoreline. ldquoThe most damaging, he says, ldquois the scallop dredge with its teeth and heavy metal bar that digs into the seabed.Since that  visit to Norway, Stinson has been back many times, in a bid not just to fish but to find out what we can learn about how we should be managing our fisheries. Armed with a GoPro camera, he has taken hours of underwater footage and interviewed fishermen, restaurant owners, fish processors and bureaucrats.Among them is Jim Lorentsen, who has owned a fishing boat for  years and talks of how good the fishing is right now. ldquoWe get good prices and a lot of fish, he says. ldquoIt wasnrsquot always like this. In the early s and s it was really bad. They hadnrsquot regulation of the fishing so they used to fish and fish until it stopped. Itrsquos unbelievable how much more fish we see now.Or there is Alf Roald Saeligtre, who runs Cornelius, a destination fish restaurant outside Bergen. ldquoThe main thing here is that we have nobody destroying the seabed, he says. ldquoThey are not allowed to dredge ... The whole approach is ecosystem-based. The last two years in Norway, in the north, we have been beating records. We are fishing extraordinary amounts of cod for fish and chips to England.Stinson says: ldquoMy campaign is to get somebody to acknowledge that the Norwegians have done what we need to do and itrsquos been to the benefit of the coastal communities. One fisherman said lsquoThis is great for us. There are  people on the island of Nesoslashy and  are employed on fishing boats.rsquoHe believes that part of the Norway fish stocks improvement is down to their seabed protection. ldquoResearch supports the idea that the seabeds are crucial habitats in some of the le stages of our larger commercial fish, he points out. ldquoBut in Scotland wersquore destroying spawning grounds. Thatrsquos probably one of the reasons why the herring are not ing. People will say therersquos nothing wrong with scallop dredging, it just needs proper management ndash no it doesnrsquot, it just needs totally eradicated.The research he refers to includes a study by Dr Sophie Elliott linking cod, haddock and whiting survival to seabed bioersity. Itrsquos particularly relevant given last weekrsquos news that, following warnings about precarious cod stock levels, the Marine Stewardship Councilhas removed its blue tick on North Sea cod.Stinson is just one of an older generation of ers who are witnesses to what decades of scallop dredging and bottom trawling have done to the Scottish seabed. His early years of ing were done in the wake of the lting in  of the three-mile limit which prohibited dredgers and trawlers from round our coastlines.But ers are not alone in having such concern. Nick Underdown, of the campaign group Open Seas, believes the government must urgently adopt a precautionary, seaward limit approach that protects the entire coastal zone, similar to the Norwegian one. He observes: ldquoScallop dredging and bottom trawling are regarded as the most damaging fisheries in Europe and yet they continue to have a widespread footprint in Scotlandrsquos inshore waters, suppressing the recovery of our collapsed inshore fish stocks.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos review of these fisheries must account for the damage done to our coastal seabed over the past  years, not just protect a few small areas. By restricting trawlers and dredgers in inshore waters, these businesses would be able to continue in deeper waters, while creating a massive opportunity for low-impact fishing and increase the number of better-paid jobs in the inshore.Alistair Sinclair, national co-ordinator for the Scottish Creel Fishermenrsquos Federation, has long campaigned for aof the three-mile limit. He points to a Scottish Government graph of the drop-off in fish stocks in the Clyde in the period following it. ldquoThe fish stock levels were reasonably healthy in the Clyde and in a short space of time ndash  years ndash they were at ground zero.Sinclair dramatically compares what has been done to our seabed to the ldquorecent burning of the Amazon forest. ldquoThe decimation that actually has gone on and the degradation on the seabed is unbelievable, unforgivable.But, as Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fisheries Federation says, this is a signicant industry, approaching pound million in value, with many jobs attached. She points out that only % of these are hand-ed and that the vast majority ldquois met through scallops landed from areas that have been fished for many years and that remain productive, so itrsquos clear that that there is room for both types of fishing.Macdonald adds: ldquoThe industry is working through the Scallop Industry Consultative Group on management proposals that cover a number of measures, including licensing. We fully recognise the importance of protecting sensitive marine species, habitats and features, and work closely with government and other stakeholders on issues including evidence-based Marine Protected Areas , and the development of appropriate management measures within MPAs.Stinson, however, wants to see an end to scallop dredging ndash although not immediately. Having worked on a couple of scallop dredgers, he is sympathetic to the fishermen who fear such an abrupt assault on their livelihoods. ldquoI donrsquot think they need to be put out of business overnight. I think it needs to be managed over  years, to shut it down. I would say we need to declare a moratorium on the further issuing of any scallop licensing ndash so no further boats.What he discovered in Norway, he believes, indicates that such measures would, far from being bad for our industry,it to its vibrancy. ldquoMobile-gear defenders always say we couldnrsquot compensate for the jobs which would be lostdredging was banned, but they have themselves destroyed the jobs of others by their destructive practice. As scallop dredging declines you would see a rise in other populations and other types of fishing would become economically possible.Why our North Sea cod is off the menu. The North Sea cod fishery was given its blue sustainability label too early. When, in , the MSC awarded it sustainability status there were actually fewer fish than the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea had calculated. Stocks had not fully recovered. As Robin Cook of the University of Strathclyde put it in an article in The Conversation this week, ldquoNow ICES has revised its earlier estimates, showing that the cod recovery plan should never have been abandoned.\". We need to pay more attention to cod habitats.The seabed really does matter for a species which inhabits inshore areas during their le, commercial inshore species like cod. Dr Sophie Elliott, lead author on a University of Glasgow study which linked cod survival to seabed bioersity, observes, ldquoThe problem about the way we undertake quotas and stocks assessments is that we just look at the fish abundance but we donrsquot take into consideration their habitat, where they live. Habitat is one of the largest factors that effects species survival, so by not taking it into account yoursquore just looking at half the picture and you can have super crashes in populations.Essential habitats such as where the fish spawn and also their nursery grounds should be focus areas for protection and stock regeneration. ldquoYou need to be able to understand what these are, where they are, to be able to provide a greater protection.\". Climate-change is having an impact. Fish species are migrating north."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Nothing like a dame to perk up this panto","story":"The Andrew Marr Show chose the latter strategy. It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise.

After all, what use is penicillinyou canrsquot call a doctor to make an appointment, orthe surgery canrsquot ring the pharmaceutical firm to order more supplies  As we face up to the climate emergency what we need now more than anything  are radical new and collaborative ways to live and work sustainably so that we and our planet can thrive.And we have them. The forward-thinking firms and entrepreneurs which Zero Waste Scotland is working with are already pioneering the circular economy ndash keeping goods and materials in a useful loop for as long as possible through reuse, remanufacture, repair and finally recycling to maximise the value of our limited resources.These pioneers are providing and developing a erse range of everyday products in innovative new sustainable ways, from lighting and computers to beds and beer.Tomorrow hundreds of leaders in business, policy and the public sector will join Zero Waste Scotland at the Scottish Resources Conferenceto celebrate and learn from these early adaptors. That second part is vital. Because we cannot create the truly circular national economy we so urgently need unless every single business and organisation follows suit, and does so fast. No matter how excellent their ideas and progress, the pioneers we work with cannot do this alone.Our huge consumption habit consistently causes the vast majority of the carbon emissions behind the climate emergency ndash so we need a national sht in behaviour. The traditional, linear system of making, using and binning products with little thought for the consequences has always been wasteful. And now the rise of fast food and more recently fast fashion is making that waste even worse.Millions of people now see the harm wreaked by our culture of convenience on endless news reports and documentaries on television such as the BBCrsquos recent War on Plastic.I doubt that legendary Scot John Logie Baird ever envisioned that the TV he invented would broadcast such shocking scenes.But Scottish wildle cameraman and photographer Doug Allan knows all too well the effect we, as people, are having on the planet. His award-winning work for BBC series such as Blue Planet has shown people how incredible our world is, and how blighted it is by climate change and plastic pollution. His powerful images have helped to fuel the public appetite for change which we have seen in the growing climate strike protests here and overseas.This week he will give a keynote speech at the SRC. Making that link between what we make, buy and often waste, the problems that causes and the solution which the circular economy presents is key. If consumers and companies join forces to change how they shop and work they can make a real, lasting dference. And not just in reducing the carbon emissions from all that waste. Becoming more sustainable will also help tackle a host of serious, related environmental issues from pollution to species loss.Over the next five years we are ramping up our work to help more businesses and the public sector find the best way to become more sustainable. What works for one firm or industry may not work for another. Revolutionising the way we design, produce and use everyday items involves complex challenges which will not be overcome overnight. Which is all the more reason why we need to close the loop sooner by transitioning to a nationwide circular economy much faster than we are currently. We wonrsquot meet the Scottish Government target for net zero carbon emissions by we move too slowly. We need to reach a tipping point within the next five years, so there is no time to waste.We have already shown that nationwide change is possible, however. Scotlandrsquos plastic bag charge reduced use of disposable carriers by  per cent within a year. Scotlandrsquos new depositscheme, urging shoppers to recycle their empty drinks bottles and cans to get their deposit back, promises to be equally successful.We have played a lead role in both schemes, which take advantage of peoplersquos natural inclination to avoid cost where that cost is made clear.Tomorrow we will publish a report suggesting that the same behaviour can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the millions of unnecessary, disposable cups which Scots use each year.

In the same way that a small boy retrieving his ball from a garden claims that it was a big boy who has now run away who did it, the Prime Minister can claim that the extension of the Brexit process was not his idea, but rather the view of his opponents and that by accepting their demands the way is now clear for a General Election, from which the victor will have a reasonable time to deal with Brexit.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.LIKE Patricia Baillie Strong , I was disgusted by the unedying performance of the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, at the despatch box last Wednesday.

I feared that a small but influential smattering of my fellow Remainers would not accept the result. And I feared that a small but influential smattering of nationalist Brexiters would pursue a Brexit which would have worked for the British Empire but wonrsquot for UK plc.After last weekrsquos debilitating performances in the House of Commons, the received wisdom is that the fault for all of this lies squarely with one side indeed, with one man, Boris Johnson. Johnsonrsquos charge sheet is indeed extensive, and his looseness with language has a long history. His comparison of Muslim women wearing the Niqab to letter boxes and bank robbers was enabling language which one could easily imagine being transferred to the street. Equating the EUrsquos drive towards further political integration to the empire-building of Hitler and Napoleon was, as well as offensive to those who live with the memory of Hitlerrsquos consequences, not the way to win friends and influence the other side in an impending negotiation.And, last week, when an emotional Paula Sherrf, citing Jo Cox, said that Johnsonrsquos chosen language of surrender, betrayal and traitor features in the abuse and death threats directed at Remain MPs, Johnson replied ldquoI have never heard such humbug in all my le. I watched this live, and gulped. It was a dismal, dismissive way to reply to a question of that substance and tone.Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister. What he says and how he says it matter a great deal. He must hold himself to a higher standard, ensuring that the consequences which his words have are positive and not negative that they heal wounds rather than reopening them.Although leaks from the  Committee meeting of backbench MPs indicated that he showed some contrition, his fellow MPs and the country as a whole would have benefited immeasurably from him doing so in public. It would have cost him very little to say sorry to Paula Sherrf, to say that he made a mistake, to say that he adopted the wrong tone in that answer. That he chose not to has made us all a little poorer.However I must say - and I say this in particular to my fellow Remainers - you are throwing stone after stone after stone through the windows of your glass houses. For your charge sheet is also long as extensive as that of your Leave opponents.Because for every Leave MP we find speaking at a rally calling Remainers traitors, we have David Lammy MP comparing the Conservative European Research Group to Hitler, a man who killed six million Jews. And for every Leave MP we have calling Hilary Bennrsquos Brexit-delaying legislation the Surrender Act, we have Ed Davey MP calling Boris Johnson a dictator, which in the lexicon of most normal people would place him in a bracket with Stalin, Pol Pot, Mugabe or Castro. And for every Brexit-supporting newspaper calling Remain MPs saboteurs, we have Remain-supporting newspapers accusing the Government of a coup, which we are presumably to believe is on par with the Sudanese Armyrsquos removal of Omar al-Bashir earlier this year.Can we see ourselves  Can we see how emaciating this is  Can David Lammy see that, unlike Hitler, MPs in the ERG are not genocidal  Can Ed Davey see that, unlike Hugo Chavez, Boris Johnson is not jailing journalists and choosing his own political opponents  If they cannot, then they belong in a dark corner of the internet, not in our Parliament.This propensity to lose all ability to be reasonable and rational is infecting more of my fellow Remainers than I had thought possible. I have always enjoyed watching Jess Phillips on television. Shersquos so raw, so real, so relevant in todayrsquos politics. But last week, referring to the \"humbug\" remark of which I wrote earlier, Phillips said very directly that Johnson referred to Jo Coxrsquos murder as humbug. He did not this was a quite deliberate and improper insinuation, ironically during Phillipsrsquo own Urgent Question about the consequences of language in politics. Again, I watched this exchange live, and felt myself deflating. Phillips instantly went from being part of the solution to being part of the problem.The Speaker, John Bercow, was reasonable and even-handed in his remarks last week, when he said that fault lay on both sides. He was right. But the trouble with many of my fellow Remainers is that they simply donrsquot agree. They carry with them a moral superiority which guides them into the unshakeable belief that we are right and they are wrong. That itrsquos okay for us to call Johnson a dictator but itrsquos not okay for him to accuse us of betrayal, because wersquore the good guys and hersquos the bad guy. The ultimate irony is that, in the final analysis, this moral superiority played a key role in the disconnection between the political classes and the people, and the subsequent loss of the  referendum.We now must hit the reset button. In my view, this is more about the deliberate attribution of inaccurate thoughts or actions to opponents than it is about language itself. The language itself is primarily spin. For instance, claiming that the Benn Act is a \"surrender\" is deliberately emotive, but little dferent to claiming that a \"hard\" Brexit is a \"clf edge\", also deliberately emotive terms designed to make you think the other option must be better.Instead, at least as a first step, I would like to see the deliberate and  attribution cease. When Boris Johnson claims that everyone who fails to support leaving the EU come-what-may on st October all want to Remain, that is as deliberate and  an attribution to them as Jess Phillipsrsquo \"humbug\" attribution is to him.Neither side can pat themselves on the back today. Neither side should be going to bed sleeping soundly in the belief that they can hold their heads high. I could count on my hands the number of MPs who I could honestly say have the right to do that.It sounds hard even unachievable. But it really is not. All they have to do is act normally.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

Large operators First Aberdeen and Stagecoach were joined by six local bus firms launching the new “Grasshopper” Day and Weekly tickets in Inverurie, which became available on Friday . The new tickets allow unlimited travel on any local bus service throughout the Aberdeen city and shire commuter belt. The Grasshopper ticket means bus customers no longer need purchase separate tickets for dferent operators. For example, a commuter travelling from Inverurie to Altens in Aberdeen would have required separate tickets to access Stagecoach and First services. Customers will instead be able to purchase one Grasshopper ticket, saving around  per cent on the cost of a ticket.It is hoped that the convenience of the new Day and Weekly tickets will tempt commuters out of their cars and help to ease congestion and reduce carbon emissions.Aberdeenshire Council, Aberdeen City Council and Nestrans recognise the role of ticketing in making public transport more attractive. The joint Fares and Ticketing Strategy for the North East includes an action to work with operators to encourage joint ticketing arrangements and Aberdeenshire Council has played a major role in facilitating the introduction of the new ticket.Grasshopper tickets are available for purchase on board services operated by First Aberdeen, Stagecoach, Bains Coaches, JM Burns, Central Taxis , Kineil Coaches, MW Nicoll Hirersand Watermill Coaches.Day tickets cost £. and Weekly Tickets £.Within Aberdeenshire the Day and Weekly tickets are available on all buses serving the commuter belt around Aberdeen. That includes Banchory, Dunecht, Echt, Ellon, Inverurie, Kemnay, Kintore, Newburgh, Newmachar, Newtonhill, Oldmeldrum, Stonehaven, Tarves and intermediate areas.Passengers should look out for the Grasshopper logo on posters or ask their driver for further information.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In a July  broadcast, Ms Munchetty had said that ldquoevery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism, adding: ldquoIrsquom not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.After being probed by her co-host Dan Walker for her thoughts, Ms Munchetty said she was ldquoabsolutely furious a man in that position thinks itrsquos OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.The ECU ruling sparked a backlash, with many expressing their outrage at the decision.Sir Lenny Henry and Krishnan Guru-Murthy were among a group of black and Asian journalists and broadcasters who called for the BBC to reverse its ruling.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also among those to comment, saying that Ms Munchetty ldquostated a fact, and urging the BBC to ldquoexplain this astonishing decision.Lord Hall said in his email that the ruling had ldquosparked an important debate about racism and its interpretation.He said: ldquoRacism is racism and the BBC is not impartial on the topic.ldquoThere was never a finding against Naga for what she said about the Presidentrsquos tweet.He continued: ldquoI have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials.ldquoI have also examined the complaint itself.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see.

I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps.

Its sole purpose would be to formally request another extension to Article , thus avoiding a no deal on October . Once an extension was secured, parliament would vote to dissolve and a general election called.As the leader of the official opposition, Jeremy Corbyn would ordinarily be the natural choice to lead any caretaker administration. But not everyone in the Commons sees it that way. A senior SNP source told The Scotsman that finding a neutral, “non-threatening” figure who could appeal to all opposition parties and Tory rebels would be a focus of talks.Anyone but CorbynWhile the SNP, the Lib Dems and the majority of Labour MPs are united in their opposition to a no deal Brexit, there are very real dferences over who should lead a temporary government.With this in mind, the Nationalists have reportedly already held private talks to try and identy an alternative candidate to Corbyn. “The SNP has no preference as to who takes charge of a caretaker government,” Ian Blackford told the Sunday Times yesterday. “We would, however, only support a person or party for as short a time is required to secure the extension and call the election.”: SNP pushes for a compromise PM to oust Boris JohnsonLib Dem supportThe SNP are, of course, not the only anti-Brexit force in Westminster. Since taking charge this summer, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has positioned her party firmly against the UK leaving the EU. The Liberals are gaining in the polls and harbour ambitions they could, after the next election, end up with more MPs than Labour to become the largest party in a loose pro-Remain coalition.But in the short term, Swinson is adamant the Lib Dems will not back any plan which would put Corbyn in power. The question is whether they would back a compromise candidate - perhaps a Tory grandee like Ken Clarke or a more centrist Labour figure like Margaret Beckett.The SNP think thatthe Liberals fudge the issue, it will play badly with Remain voters - and cement the Nationalists’ position in Scotland as the leading anti-Brexit party when voters go back to the polls.Election feverIt is now accepted by all parties that a general election will be called, regardless of whether a confidence motion is successful. While party leaders say they are focused on Brexit, they are also positioning themselves for the gruelling election campaign that will inevitably follow.Both the SNP and Lib Dems believe they stand to make gains at Labour and the Conservatives’ expense north of the Border. Being able to claim credit for avoiding a no deal would play well in certain constituencies.If - and it remains a very big , given recent polling - Labour was to emerge as the largest party after such a vote, it would most likely form a minority government, reliant on support from the SNP and others to pass legislation.Such a result would throw up a whole set of new questions on what price the Nationalists would demand from Labour in .The Conservatives, meanwhile, are confident that public anger over the delay to Brexit will sweep the party to power.

There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from educating rita to shirley valentine","story":", words of script could seem daunting to many a seasoned actor but West Belfast actress Tara Lynne O’Neill is sharing each and every one with pathos, poignancy and hilarity as she continues her storming Shirley Valentine at the Lyric Theatre.The Derry Girls actress was approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part she had no hesitation in accepting.“It was a play I’ve always wanted to do. I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"as a family we have given wrightbus around 75 years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_cce-a-ec-b-ecdd_EmailParty leaders in Northern Ireland must “do the right thing for the people”, Julian Smith said ahead of urgent talks to restore powersharing at Stormont..pushThe Northern Ireland Secretary warned the public has seen the quality of public services “decline” and key decisions “kicked into the long grass” in Northern Ireland without a ing executive.He addedan executive cannot be restored then the Government will “pursue the decision-making powers that are needed at the earliest opportunity”, while also highlighting legal requirements on the UK Parliament to extend same-sex marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland.Speaking in the Commons, Mr Smith told MPs: “The duty to legislate will come into effectthe executive is not back up and running before October  and my department will shortly begin an awareness campaign to ensure that women and citizens across Northern Ireland are clear as to how we plan to proceed to regulate for these new legal duties.”I will this week work urgently with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to do everything I can to break the logjam and to get Stormont up and runningJulian SmithMr Smith said the Government’s preference is such issues are taken forward by a restored assembly and executive, adding: “But to those who now lobby me and others in Government to somehow change the law, I say the only way for these laws to change and to be shaped in the best interests of Northern Ireland is for Northern Ireland party leaders to form an executive and to get back into government.“To that end, following frustratingly slow pace over the summer due to a range of factors, I will this week work urgently with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to do everything I can to break the logjam and to get Stormont up and running because the time for that is now.“The party leaders need to show leadership and do the right thing for the people of Northern Ireland.”DUP MP Sammy Wilsonsaid Mr Smith has “fallen into the trap” by “spreading the blame” across all party leaders for the lack of an executive, adding: “The only party leader who is opposing and stopping the formation of the executive in Northern Ireland is the leader of Sinn Fein.”Mr Smith also said there is a commitment to introduce a historical institutional abuse bill in Westminster “by the end of the year” in the absence of an executive.Independent Lady Hermonsought assurances on when such legislation would come forward, adding: “They have been enormously patient, they have suffered for too long, they have waited too long and they deserve compensation – when will it be ”Mr Smith said he is “confident” the legislation can be brought forward in the “coming weeks”.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds questioned why legislation connected to Brexit and abortion law could be passed within hours, adding on compensating victims: “There’s absolutely no reason why this legislation can’t be passed very, very quickly.”Tory MP Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, said legislation on historical institutional abuse needs to be worked out before Christmas, and warned MPs may not vote in favour of the Queen’s Speechit is not included.He saidhistorical abuse on this scale had taken place anywhere  “it would have been rectied and sorted out by now”.He said: “Unless there is a bill announced in the Queen’s Speech, my hunch may be that some of us would find grave dficulty voting for the gracious speech when the vote is called.”On abortion, the DUP’s Mr Wilson said the Northern IrelandAct  was “hijacked” by Labour.He said: “This billwe were going to give it a name as to its effect would either be the prevention of the formation of the executive in Northern Ireland bill, or some of the people in Northern Ireland who have protested in the streets over recent weeks about the most controversial part of this, see it as the kill babies in Northern Ireland bill, that’s the kind of anger which it has generated.”Deputy Speaker Dame Rosie Winterton intervened saying: “I do feel the use of inflammatory language is absolutely unacceptable.”Shadow Northern Ireland minister Karin Smyth asked what discussions are taking place in Brexit negotiations to stop “human traffickers and enslavers” exploiting Northern Ireland’s land border.Ms Smyth said there needed to be enough police resources to tackle human traffickers, and said it will also be important to make sure there are resources to support victims of human trafficking.She said: “These are victims and victims,we do find them andwe are able to support them which in itself is a massive , they do require a lot of support and resource, particularly around housing, and particularly around health provision and especially, as part of that, around mental health support and counselling.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38544780.ece/49660/BINARY/tenpounds.jpg","title":"northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes withdrawn from

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings. This means that the spotlight will be on Irish Street for the foreseeable future.As part of the planned commercial development, the townrsquos former police base, which enjoys protected status, could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Local council officials say they are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its development opportunity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s recent run ended by Rosemount  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United ed to Pigeon Hill on Saturday looking to make it three league wins in a row, but it wasnrsquot to be as Rosemount Rec where eventually able to leave with the spoils.The Saints started the game brightly and in the opening minutes created a few opportunities, but against the run of play Rosemount took the lead when their number nine cut in from the left and found the bottom corner.From then on, Rosemount started to dominate possession and they found a second when a long-range effort found the bottom corner.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In a July  broadcast, Ms Munchetty had said that ldquoevery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism, adding: ldquoIrsquom not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.After being probed by her co-host Dan Walker for her thoughts, Ms Munchetty said she was ldquoabsolutely furious a man in that position thinks itrsquos OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.The ECU ruling sparked a backlash, with many expressing their outrage at the decision.Sir Lenny Henry and Krishnan Guru-Murthy were among a group of black and Asian journalists and broadcasters who called for the BBC to reverse its ruling.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also among those to comment, saying that Ms Munchetty ldquostated a fact, and urging the BBC to ldquoexplain this astonishing decision.Lord Hall said in his email that the ruling had ldquosparked an important debate about racism and its interpretation.He said: ldquoRacism is racism and the BBC is not impartial on the topic.ldquoThere was never a finding against Naga for what she said about the Presidentrsquos tweet.He continued: ldquoI have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials.ldquoI have also examined the complaint itself. It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and dficult judgements.ldquoBut, in this instance, I donrsquot think Nagarsquos words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear.He said Ms Munchetty was ldquoan exceptional journalist and presenter, adding: ldquoI am proud that she works for the BBC. Journalist and authorAfua Hirsch welcomed the decision, but asked: ldquoHow did this happen in the first place The writer was one of several people who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reverse its decision.Following Lord Hallrsquos message, she wrote on Twitter: ldquoGood to see BBC has reversed its discriminatory decision, but .

Harry added: ldquoWe are literally driving ourselves to extinction.

So, join us today and share your own view, by looking up! Post images of the trees in your local community using the hashtag #LookingUp.

Commonwealth countries have been invited to submit forests and national parks to be protected and preserved as well as to plant trees. The Duke has helped QCC projects in the Caribbean, U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Botswana, Malawi, and Tonga. Now, almost  countries are taking part and have dedicated indigenous forests for conservation and committed to planting millions of new trees to help combat climate change. The Dukersquos longtime passion for trees and forests as naturersquos simple solution to the environmental issues we face has been inspired by the work he has been doing on behalf of his grandmother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, for many years.He added: ldquoI think itrsquos becoming more and more obvious that ecosystems across the world are under massive threat, and I think for too long therersquos been a part or a group of people that have said, lsquooh, you just want to protect those trees because theyrsquore pretty or because they have some sort of purposersquo. ldquoBut what is the purpose  The purpose is vast, for every single one of us, as Irsquove said we need to appreciate what already exists. ldquoEverything has a purpose, we need to make sure that we have a purpose in that whole system. .push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry: Human race  udriving ourselves to extinction u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland.

Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
