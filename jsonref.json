Nobody was turned away, nobody was disrespectful and it was a wonderful experience. It was a nice experience and nobody was mean to me at all, I was quite surprised.’Of the letter, she added: ‘I can’t tell you what I wrote in the letter but I think I accomplished my goal and we’ll just have to wait and see how it was received.‘I wanted to express some sentiments and set some records straight. I can’t give the details of that but I really wanted the world and really my sister and the British Royal family to know what happened and know the truth about a lot of things.’Although Samantha wouldn’t reveal exactly what was in the note, she did say that much of it concerned their father Thomas Markle Sr. and she says she now hopes it will lead to the pair being reconciled.Speaking directly to Meghan, the 53-year-old: ‘Let’s just cut through all the cr*p, you’re a woman, life is short. I believe you have it in your heart to do the right thing here.‘You know Dad loves you, you know he’s been there for you more than anyone, so don’t let this public monster and misperception that he’s like a sperm donor dad trying to be involved all of a sudden.

I know the public would love me to or say that’s my next move but I’m not tacky.‘With all due respect, I think the next move is not mine, the ball is in my sister’s court and it’s kind of cheesy to minimize it to a tennis game when really, this is life, we’re real people, human beings, real family, real love.‘It’s not a game but she needs to do the right thing now and she knows how much my dad loves her and has given her.‘It’s a real family and life is very short so I just hope, for her sake as well, that Meg doesn’t let this go.‘I was concerned about my father passing away without resolve here because that would be awful for everybody and I really doubt she could live with that.

Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.          The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.How wide is Hurricane Michael?The storm is threatening more than 300 miles of the Golf Coast and is expected to make landfall along a 150-mile stretch of the Florida coast.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.When will Hurricane Michael make landfall?Though the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’          The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ World Mental Health Day: What is it, when is it and what is 2018\u0027s theme? EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 9Overwatch Halloween 2018: What time does it start and what are the new skins?Hurricane Michael: Tracker, path, evacuation zones and moreHow to check if you have a Google Plus account and how to delete itAmerican Music Awards 2018: All you need to knowAda Lovelace Day 2018: When is it and who was Ada Lovelace?Made by Google Pixel 3: How to watch the event and what to expectWorld Post Day: 2018 theme, date and moreNew Kids on the Block Mixtape Tour 2019: Dates, tickets, support acts and moreJohn Terry\u0027s net worth revealed after he retires from football2018 midterms: When are the voter registration deadlines in all the 50 states?The Walking Dead Season 9 Spoilers: What time does it start in the UK and what happens in the premiere?How to tell if your Facebook account has been hackedStrictly Come Dancing: Seann Walsh and Katya Jones slammed by Piers MorganRiverdale season 3: Spoilers, premiere date, time, trailer, cast and more revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

Chief executive of Ladbrokes and Coral owner GVC, Kenny Alexander, said the number of ads appearing during football games has got \u0027out of hand\u0027 and called for the industry to tighten its gambling regulationsMr Alexander spoke at an event in Parliament yesterday where he unveiled millions of pounds of funding for Sports Aid, which gives financial support to young sports stars. He also announced a new ‘corporate social responsibility’ initiative to minimise potential harm caused by gambling, including millions of pounds towards education programmes.He told MPs: ‘I am one of the leaders of an industry that has had much criticism over the past few years. I think much of it is justified.‘In the past six months or so I have looked into the area of problem gambling to educate myself about it. I’ve been at the coalface: I’ve visited gambling rehab centres, spoken to many of the people there, listened to their issues. \u0027The vast majority of people who come to our websites have a very enjoyable experience. But it can be dangerous and it can be destructive. \u0027Many of those people in residential rehab centres have lost their wives, they have lost their families, they’ve lost their money and many have lost all hope. We take this very seriously.’Mr Alexander went on: ‘We think there should be a complete ban on live betting around football matches before the watershed. If you watch live football there are undoubtedly far, far too many adverts.‘There has been a lot of research around young people – 75 per cent of them said there were too many live adverts around football. They are probably the most vulnerable to problem gambling, so if they say there’s too many adverts, it’s fair to say there’s too many adverts.’Licence to... DRIVE! How bungling spy sold his luxury...British politicians will be exposed for their links with...Share this articleA spokesman for GVC said it would not stop advertising around matches unilaterally, because that would allow competitors to move in. And any ban would not cover adverts around horse racing.Mr Alexander told the Mail: ‘The industry has done a lot on responsible gambling, but there is always more to be done. We will work with the industry, Government and the regulator in tackling this issue.‘As one of the world’s leading betting and gaming operators, we need to ensure we do everything we can to ensure an enjoyable experience for our players that minimises the potential to cause harm.’Yesterday GVC announced a research partnership with a university to identify the extent of online gambling, and gave £500,000 to the Gam Care charity to help it roll out its youth outreach programme and £4million for other responsible gaming programmes.Last night, Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the Campaign For Fairer Gambling, said: ‘In-game gambling ads negatively impact children, which is why Australia and Italy banned them.

Chief executive of Ladbrokes and Coral owner GVC, Kenny Alexander, said the number of ads appearing during football games has got \u0027out of hand\u0027 and called for the industry to tighten its gambling regulationsMr Alexander spoke at an event in Parliament yesterday where he unveiled millions of pounds of funding for Sports Aid, which gives financial support to young sports stars. He also announced a new ‘corporate social responsibility’ initiative to minimise potential harm caused by gambling, including millions of pounds towards education programmes.He told MPs: ‘I am one of the leaders of an industry that has had much criticism over the past few years. I think much of it is justified.‘In the past six months or so I have looked into the area of problem gambling to educate myself about it. I’ve been at the coalface: I’ve visited gambling rehab centres, spoken to many of the people there, listened to their issues. \u0027The vast majority of people who come to our websites have a very enjoyable experience. But it can be dangerous and it can be destructive. \u0027Many of those people in residential rehab centres have lost their wives, they have lost their families, they’ve lost their money and many have lost all hope. We take this very seriously.’Mr Alexander went on: ‘We think there should be a complete ban on live betting around football matches before the watershed. If you watch live football there are undoubtedly far, far too many adverts.‘There has been a lot of research around young people – 75 per cent of them said there were too many live adverts around football. They are probably the most vulnerable to problem gambling, so if they say there’s too many adverts, it’s fair to say there’s too many adverts.’Licence to... DRIVE!

We will work with the industry, Government and the regulator in tackling this issue.‘As one of the world’s leading betting and gaming operators, we need to ensure we do everything we can to ensure an enjoyable experience for our players that minimises the potential to cause harm.’Yesterday GVC announced a research partnership with a university to identify the extent of online gambling, and gave £500,000 to the Gam Care charity to help it roll out its youth outreach programme and £4million for other responsible gaming programmes.Last night, Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the Campaign For Fairer Gambling, said: ‘In-game gambling ads negatively impact children, which is why Australia and Italy banned them.

So we\u0027ll have a crew that will roam around looking for locations,\u0027 San Francisco Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru told KGO. \u0027We actually have data for neighborhoods where we get frequent calls.\u0027               Some San Francisco streets are so covered in human feces that the city launched a \u0027Poop Patrol\u0027 to clean the mess          Mayor London Breed of San Francisco, who was elected in June, has made unannounced inspections of neighborhoods, sometimes carrying a broomSan Fran\u0027s mayor, London Breed, also says cleaning up the city\u0027s streets are a top priority. \u0027I\u0027ve had to deal with it myself in front of my home and it\u0027s not a pleasant feeling,\u0027 she told KGO. \u0027I want to change San Francisco for the better.

The other 3,146 were designated sheltered. One resident even created a Poop Map for people to report messes as they come across them.  The poop patrol with consist of six dedicated employees and two trucks at a cost of $750,000.  The Department of Public Works says that the aim is to spot the mess and steam clean it away before complaints are even made.       \u0027So, what happens is we\u0027re going to take one of those crews out and try to get ahead of those calls and look for these locations so that hopefully we can get less numbers of calls coming in,\u0027 Nuru added.

The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                         "},{"url":null,"title":"Bobbie cockapoo cost owner 1 500 popped three hours","story":"Four-year-old Bobbie caused some £1,500 of damage as he shredded the door          Tara Jameson with her beloved cockapoo Bobbie who chewed a hole through her mother\u0027s front doorBobbie, who had been left with box full of new toys, chewed through the front door before destroying a parcel containing a TV box, waiting to be returned. Mr Jameson said Bobbie \u0027gets jealous\u0027 when her boyfriend goes round her house and the dog will sleep on the end of her bed - but when she wakes up, he\u0027s on her pillow.   Ms Jameson, a postal worker, said: \u0027Bobbie went through a phase where he became quite destructive when he was left and I even got a dog therapist to try and help.The £80m mortgage: Property tycoon Nick Candy takes out one...Rare copies of graphic sex novel by randy nobleman Marquis...Share this article\u0027I moved in with my mum and a few days before we sadly lost our old dog.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement.

The fuzzy grey mass is made of millions of tiny porcelain sculptures, an allusion to old Mao Zedong propaganda that depicted the people as sunflowers, and therefore the late chairman as the sun.The more essential fact of the work, however, is that it took 1,600 artisans from China’s home of imperial porcelain more than two years to make these seeds. To know this is to understand how the monumental relies on the miniscule, on hundreds of millions of single brushstrokes applied by human hands. The care and attention the artisans paid to each seed, despite the sheer number of them, extolls the value of the inidual.To a packed auditorium at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Ai described Sunflower Seeds as “the smallest sculptures possible”.“So then you have to make a lot,” he quipped, prompting the audience’s adoring laughter. At the end of September, Ai made his LA debut with three concurrent exhibitions: Life Cycle, which greets visitors with Sunflower Seeds at MAF a self-titled show to inaugurate New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch’s new LA space and CaoHumanity at Beverly Hills’ UTA Artist Space, a gallery run by the Hollywood representatives of the United Talent Agency. His whirlwind debut included attending all the parties thrown in his honor and taking selfies with an enthusiastic public – all of which was systematically logged on his Instagram account.It’s Ai’s ardent criticism of human rights violations, often in the form of potent, large-scale public works, that’s garnered such global renown. In China, however, “Subversion of state power is a strong crime,” Ai tells the , and in 2011, following his condemnations of governmental corruption, the Chinese state demolished his Shanghai studio, subsequently imprisoned him for three months, and confiscated his passport for almost four years.Since Ai was given his passport back in 2014, he’s relocated to Berlin and shifted his focus on the global crisis of displacement, creating works that advocate for refugee rights. At MAF, what follows Sunflower Seeds is the titular new work, Life Cycle, an enormous refugee boat woven from strands of bamboo. And his searing 2017 documentary Human Flow, was an intimate portrait of human displacement.The film brought Ai to settlement camps in 23 different countries, but one of his last stops was Los Angeles for the promotion of the film. Despite the artist’s near constant and global exhibition schedule, LA had eluded him up until Hollywood’s intervention. Joshua Roth, the UTA agent who secured the financing for Human Flow, also invited Ai to exhibit in his gallery, and introduced him to friends with a newly opened art foundation, Guess Jeans founders Paul and Maurice Marciano.Ai’s Los Angeles debut arrived at an emotionally fraught moment. Roth died unexpectedly from heart complications just weeks before his opening, coating MAF with an air of grief as as a tearful Maurice Mariano introduced the exhibition. At that point, Ai was still mourning the loss of his Beijing studio of of 12 years. In early August, his studio assistants began sending him footage of Chinese authorities razing the building to the ground, this time alongside other artists’ studios and migrant workers’ homes in the name of real estate development.“In China, basically, there’s no real private property,” he says. “Everything belongs to the government. If they don’t let you use it, you’re violating some kind of law.” As Ai’s three-year Berlin visa nears its expiration date, he’s announced plans to move to Hudson, New York. In Beijing, one studio, the compound of his former residence remains, but he holds out little hope for it.Despite living in Europe, China has been the headquarters of production for much of Ai’s work. He employs scores of master craftsmen specializing in porcelain, bamboo, silk, not only as a material homage to Chinese history and tradition, but to ensure the necessary precision of their handiwork.“I cannot accept anything which is not precise, or I feel ashamed,” Ai says, explaining why, on the morning of his Jeffrey Deitch opening, his studio assistants were diligently nudging almost 6,000 antique Chinese stools by as little as a quarter inch over the gallery floor. The original installation was overcrowded, he had found, and needed to be fixed. Just hours before show time, they were being rearranged and set in place, with their legs overlapping at the uniform angle of a line of Rockettes.The Deitch exhibition marked the first time Ai had seen the 2014 installation, Stools, in real life. He had originally deployed them to Berlin’s Gropius Bau while he was still detained in China, and out of necessity during his four-year detention, he and his studio developed a system of mapping exhibitions remotely using computer renderings. His control over the layout of his shows continues to this day.“We just need to execute the plan,” Deitch says, referring to exhibitors of Ai’s work. “Of course, it has to be done exactly right.”A necessity of Ai’s practice, which applies to most artists who wish to make a living off of their work, is the gift shop component. The flip side to making political statements is making highly sought-after commercial work. His projects of populist appeal include skateboards and wine bottle labels bearing images of iconic works. At Deitch, the gallerist chose Ai for his inaugural show because for the artist’s excellent command of space, he said, but in the gallery, Stools is overcrowded on all sides with more collector-friendly works – Lego portraits of Chinese zodiac animals and a series of precious cubes sculpted from porcelain, marble, and pricey tea leaves.At UTA, the centerpiece of CaoHumanity is the lawn of marble blades of grass on the gallery floor, with Cao meaning grass – an apt metaphor for a mass collection of inidual parts – as well as a common substitute for fuck on the censored Chinese internet. In contrast to the uplifting sentiments of Life Cycle, the forceful expletive is what resounds here. An arm holding up its middle finger, disembodied not at the shoulder but up to the ear, nods to Study of Perspective, a series of photographs taken from 1995 to 2003 of Ai’s middle finger in front of various world monuments. Here, it’s been retooled as an arm sculpted in glass, and as a graphic that repeats over the wallpaper in the gallery. Over the course of the three LA exhibitions, a formula starts to emerge: each features a field of objects as its centerpiece, sounded by sculptural tokens of grander bodies of work.Ai spoke to the  just before the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, and criticized the apathy on display during his confirmation hearings, characterizing American democracy as a “moving concept”.“The top officials, they’re not on the side of someone being victimized,” he said, in reference to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault. “This lady has to reveal the most painful moment, and you see so many congressmen question her integrity, and the whole world is watching.” Privilege and the illusion of freedom have bred a toxic apathy in the United States, he says. “You’re living at somebody else’s cost, and it’s immoral by not bearing your responsibility.”What kind of change his or any political artist’s work can actually achieve remains an open question. In his book 9.5 Theses on Art and Class, the art critic Ben Davis argues that political art is not a force on par with real-life organizing and the in-depth analysis of policy. The shortcoming of aesthetic political gestures is that while they present us with a problem, they rarely offer a course of resolution. Quoting Susan Sontag, he writes: “Photographs of an atrocity may give rise to opposing responses. Or, simply the bemused awareness, continually restocked by photographic information, that terrible things happen.”At this point in time, our awareness of widespread displacement, famine, and a host of global ills has not been enough to reverse them.“It’s so easy,” Ai says, providing little in the way of strategy. “Just be aware that life is special. If we’re conscious about it, then things will change.” In lieu of answers, what his work does provide is a generous relief, a moment of levity in a time when humanity badly needs it. The momentous power in his art is its ability to draw the public together in collective awe. At Lacma, he closed by telling his audience: “We are more dependent on each other than any other time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52bd17a9c9882879b63b945917cd15130802b3f1/690_735_2536_1521/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b3c4d8733b02a20f4e1196f6226c44","title":"evelyn hofer immersive new york in pictures","story":"In the 1960s and 70s, Evelyn Hofer turned her eye to New York, capturing everyday life from the ever-expanding architecture to the wide range of people inhabiting the city.

Tisdall, an arts consultant in her early 60s, moved into the New Ground complex in north London just over a year ago.“I had been mulling over how I wanted to live,” she says. “I’m orced – my daughters and grandchildren were grown up. I didn’t want to get older on my own. It can be harsh living in London as you age.”Tisdall, an arts consultant, was lucky to secure one of the 26 apartments in the development, just a short stroll from the high street and tube station. Its L-shaped design, with a single entrance that takes residents past the common room, is intended to foster casual social interaction, and there is a communal garden and space to cook and share meals together. Residents are aged between 50 and 90.The development is managed by the Older Women’s Co-housing Community (Owch), set up to bring the principle of co-housing communities established in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands to the UK. It took 18 years to secure a housing association partner and a site, by which time many of the original group had found alternatives or died.“There are not many options for the old in the UK,” says Maria Brenton, a founding member. “One-third of over 65s live on their own, which can cause loneliness and ill health – and two thirds of those are older women. Older people I have researched don’t want to live in institutions like a care home. And often say they don’t want to end up like their parents – isolated and lonely.”With the world’s population getting older and more urban, the needs of older residents will play an increasingly important part in the shaping of cities. According to UN figures, the number of over 60s is set to double by 2050, rising from 962m in 2017 to 2.1bn. Already in Akita, Japan, one in three people is over 65. All cities will need to adapt to meet this massive demographic change.Currently more than 700 cities in 39 countries are signed up to the World Health Organization’s global network of age-friendly cities and communities to promote healthy active ageing and improve the quality of life for people over 60. Membership doesn’t necessarily denote an age-friendly city, but that it is committed to listening and working with its older population to create one.Prof Chris Phillipson, of Manchester University’s Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing and co-editor of Age-friendly Cities and communities: A Global Perspective, works with WHO to evaluate the programme’s progress, and says ageing populations need to be part of the debate about urban development: “New approaches are needed which link the advantages of living in cities with the needs and aspirations of older people themselves.”One imperative is building new houses – or upgrading existing ones – to meet the needs of older residents, says Julia Park, a lead architect with Levitt Bernstein and co-author of Age-friendly Housing. “We have traditionally defaulted to retiring to the suburbs or the coast, but better public transport and more local facilities make cities a more logical choice. Apartment living makes a great deal of sense for older people too.”The vast majority of homes were not built with the needs of older people in mind. “Wherever you go in the world, there are small houses with lots of steps. Ageing hasn’t been factored in older people had to accept it that they couldn’t go out and participate in civic life or visit friends and family.”Just under a decade ago the UK government published the first housing our ageing population panel for innovation (Happi) report to set design principles for older people, based on examples of best practice from across Europe. Since then there have been some major advances in the quality of UK housing design, partly in response to demand from older people themselves. “The new generation of over 55s are baby boomers who are much more vocal than their parents and grandparents were,” says Park. “We don’t expect to be ignored or told that ‘it’s bath-time’.”People approaching old age now are also more design-aware. “They are staying younger in outlook for longer. Until recently, specialised housing for older people was a last resort we are finally starting to see options that are tempting us to move from choice.”Park points to the Ørestad development in Copenhagen as an example of stylish, practical age-friendly housing that caters for high levels of need. Classed as a retirement home, the living costs of Ørestad’s residents are subsidised by the municipality. The prominent and colourful building contains flexible social spaces, as well as a ground-floor cafe, hair salon and dental surgery that are open to the public. “People like to mix and feel connected. As many of the residents are living with advanced dementia, getting out is difficult – inviting the public in is a logical and positive response,” says Park.Most people won’t move in old age, meaning adapting existing housing stock is also important. Programmes to insulate and improve the energy efficiency of homes benefit older people. Schemes like Homeshare bring together people with a room to spare and people needing accommodation, in return for companionship and around 10 hours a week of agreed tasks. Accessory dwelling units, formerly known as granny flats, are another way of creating multi-generational accommodation without having to move house.Lighting and heating can be controlled remotely, and smart toilets are increasingly being specified to improve hygiene and increase independence. Ceiling-mounted cameras can detect changes in an elderly person’s walking pattern, which can be an early indicator of stroke, while devices fitted to toilet bowls can detect urine for diabetes. Older people may be among those who benefit most from smart city innovations such as the Kalasatama Smart City project in Helsinki. The Kotisatama senior housing community and its 80 residents serve as a testbed for new and pilot age-friendly services before they are rolled out to the rest of the district.The quality of the environment outside the home has a huge bearing on an older person’s quality of life. Joe Oldman, Age UK’s policy manager for housing and transport, says paying attention to the built environment can make the difference between someone participating in life, and them being isolated at home. “Accessible public transport, level pavements, places to sit, the removal of trip hazards, good street lighting and public toilets are all vital components to encouraging older people to stay engaged with their local community.”New York City has added 1,500 new benches and 3,500 new or improved bus shelters in the last decade, in consultation with senior centres on their placement – such as within 250 metres from hospitals or community facilities. In the UK, 300 businesses in Nottingham have signed up to the city’s Take a Seat scheme, identifying shops where older and disabled people are welcome to rest with a “We are age-friendly” sticker. With older people less likely to drive, affordable, accessible public transport is crucial to an age-friendly city. In January a UK study of 18,000 over-50s found that free public transport resulted in fewer cases of depression, after researchers tracked changes in mental health before and after people became eligible for free travel.Natalie Turner of the UK charity, the Centre for Ageing Better, believes cities need inclusive transport strategies. “Good transport links help everyone, whatever their age, to access vital services such as doctors and social and cultural amenities, so that they can be involved in city life, stay independent and keep up social connections.”Innovative schemes are making cycling more accessible to older people. In south London, disability charity Wheels for Wellbeing offers sessions on specially adapted bikes, encouraging users to keep mobile, independent and fit. For those who no longer have the physical ability, Cycling Without Age – piloted in Copenhagen and now in 40 countries – enables the elderly to go out in tricycle rickshaws pedalled by volunteers. An age-friendly city should provide opportunities for people to participate in public life and contribute to their communities, through paid or voluntary work. Evidence shows doing so increases social contact and good health. In Hong Kong the elder friendly employment practice helps older people to continue flexible employment post-retirement, through initiatives such as employment fairs and an online job-matching.Roger Battersby, an architectural consultant to PRP Architects, specialising in age-friendly housing in China, says many members of the country’s growing population of over-65s are employed by local government in landscaping services. “One sees armies of older people tending the urban landscapes which, as a consequence, are generally of a high quality.”But Professor Chris Phillipson says an age-friendly city needs to go far beyond work, housing and infrastructure to take in global factors such as climate change and pollution, to which older people are particularly vulnerable. Unless the bigger picture is tackled, Phillipson says, we are likely to see an increasingly unequal society in the future, with the elderly among those bearing the brunt. “There will be a significant number of people in their 50s still renting. One-third of over 50s don’t own property. They will have rented for a long time and won’t have equity or savings. Gentrification has also had an appalling effect on older people.”One example is Berlin, where low-income flats are being sold to private developers, leading to rent increases that have made many areas unaffordable to older people.“We need policies that have a real impact on the urban development that is taking place,” says Phillipson. “If the environment is hostile to people on low incomes, that impacts disproportionally on older residents. Cities must not think about housing and town planning policies in isolation. Age-friendliness needs to be part of the debate about urban development.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c149bb9945f3348a8551749863781edfb3849243/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71435a322bd5b44a7f4bc340603ff5c","title":"brexit leaving eu farming agriculture","story":"It is also arguably the most regressive transfer of public money in the modern world. Farmers are paid by the hectare for owning or using land so the more you have, the more you get. While in the UK benefits for poor people are capped at £20,000 (outside London), these benefits for the rich are uncapped. Some landowners receive £1m or more. You don’t even have to live in the EU to take this money: you just have to own land here. Among the benefit tourists sucking up public funds in the age of austerity are Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes and Texas oil barons.It is hard to discern any just principle behind an occupational qualification for receiving public money. Some farmers are poor, but seldom as poor as rural people who have no land, no buildings and no jobs. Why should one profession be supported when others aren’t?Yet even farmers have been hurt by these payments. European subsidies have helped turn farmland into a speculative honeypot, making it highly attractive to City financiers. The price of land has more than doubled since payments by the hectare were introduced, pushing it out of reach of most farmers. By reinforcing economies of scale, these subsidies have driven out small farmers and accelerated the consolidation of land ownership.Though we have paid enough money to have bought all the farmland in this country several times over, we have not acquired any direct democratic control over the land: farming, however it might alter landscape features, remains outside the planning system. The system amounts to taxation without representation.So you might have hoped that this would be a hot topic, surrounded by fierce debates about what should best replace this outrageous boondoggle. But, as the agriculture bill receives its second reading in the House of Commons on Wednesday, there is scarcely a murmur of either enthusiasm or dissent from the main opposition parties. The government’s proposals are a major improvement on the current system. It intends that farmers should be paid for protecting wildlife and ecosystems rather than for owning land. It wants to use subsidies to improve the health of the nation’s soils, the quality of its water and the character of its landscape. It encourages collaboration between different land managers – woefully lacking in our incoherent approach to environmental protection. But there is much to be challenged.The first problem is that the government proposes to use public money as a substitute for regulation. Much of its new system amounts to payments for not mugging old ladies: rewarding people for not doing things they shouldn’t be doing anyway. Strong regulations, with proper monitoring and enforcement, would keep the soil on the land and nitrates out of the water without the need for this protection racket.Nowhere is this replacement of rules with money more preposterous than when applied to farm animal welfare. The government acknowledges that standards should be raised. But instead of doing so through legislation, it proposes “targeted payments” for farmers who treat their animals well. Why should animal welfare be a matter of economic choice?It is also hard to see how its policies would defend small farmers. The European system has been a disaster for them, but will this be any better? The question is sharpened by the government’s ambition to strike a US-UK trade deal, which is likely to sacrifice farming in return for concessions on financial services. Any US government, which has much lower food and welfare standards, will want a deal that lets it sell its disgusting farm products in the UK. If this happens, only the biggest and meanest farmers here will be able to compete.The evidence from New Zealand, where all subsidies were stopped in 1984, is mixed. Since then, livestock farms have consolidated, but the number of small horticultural farms and vineyards has risen. I want to see opposition parties press the government to do two things. First, to promise that any US-UK trade deal will exclude food and agriculture altogether, even if this means no deal. Secondly, to ensure that supermarkets, which exercise monopsonistic power (too few buyers), pay a fair price to the farmers they currently exploit.I would argue that payments for environmental goods should be reserved for those that didn’t exist before, while existing wildlife habitats are protected through regulation. I also believe that farmers should seek planning permission before changing a field boundary, ploughing a meadow or felling an orchard.But I’m less clear about whether there should be a special support payment for small farmers, as some people argue. How would we distinguish between those who owe their living to farming and those who have bought their land as a hobby? Why should small farmers receive this money when small builders do not?Perhaps we need an entirely different approach. How about expanding the stock of county farms (publicly owned land), which has been steadily shrinking as a result of government cuts? Where the land is suitable, county councils could ide up their farms and offer tenancies to small farmers at below-market rates. This might be a better way of supporting genuine farmers with public money. And how about a community right to buy land, of the kind now exercised in Scotland?I don’t have all the answers, and I doubt anyone else does. But I do know that good policy depends on constant challenge and debate. And so far, there hasn’t been enough of either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52208e18d5a9ad873d4576a9e7ceb9bd6653a01f/0_5_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809d47055b1af63cac57d03f4a50d61c","title":"corbynism work government borough haringey","story":"What will a Corbyn government actually do? Brexit aside, British politics has no bigger known unknown. The prospect fills the rich with fear and the left with hope. Both sides assume that Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn will be defined by his radicalism, yet in one corner of Britain an arm of the state is already ruling in his name. And the early results are sobering.In the north London borough of Haringey, the Blairite council leadership was deposed by Labour members a few months ago and replaced with avowed leftwingers. Said the new council leader, Joe Ejiofor: “Over the next four years, it will be up to us to show everybody what this mythical beast the Corbyn council does.” The title may not have been of his making, but by God was he going to wear it. “It is for the many, not the few.”Everybody cheering that May morning knew what he meant. No more slinging families out of their homes to clear way for multinational developers. No more machine politics and trampling over communities. No more of the politics of contempt.It was the willingness of the previous leader, Claire Kober, to hand swaths of the borough over to giant building companies that forced her out of office. The Corbyn councillors know they’ll be judged on how far they protect locals from a predatory property industry, which is why they have cancelled the terrible Haringey Development Vehicle. But a real case study of the possibilities and pitfalls of Corbynism in government can be seen right now, in the battle over a small market in Tottenham.Everyone’s first impressions of Seven Sisters market are terrible. No signs welcome passersby, and the front is almost truculent in its tattiness. But venture inside, and, as another  contributor wrote of a visit: “Within a minute of arriving it was obvious to me that it is irreplaceable.” Because it is magic: a warren of stalls, customised with wooden balconies and eaves, where nearly all the shopkeepers are from Latin America. They sell Colombian coffee and Argentinian meat and films from back home. The soundtrack is a babble of Spanish and salsa. Latin Americans, among them Corbyn’s wife, Laura Alvarez, flock here from across the capital.“Without this market, the community would have a mental breakdown,” says Vicky Alvarez, who runs a hairdresser’s. In a city that brags of its openness to the world, here’s a corner that bears that out. In a nation of shopkeepers, here are migrants grafting to realise their dreams. About 80 families rely on the so-called Latin Village for their living. Generations of kids have been raised here, playing in the plywood warren. Alvarez says, “We are like meerkats, watching over each other’s children.”It may take a village to raise a child, but it has taken migrants to raise this village. I remember when this place was semi-derelict.Anywhere else, the Latin Village would be a prize attraction – but Haringey has decided it should be knocked down and handed over to Britain’s biggest private residential landlord to redevelop. Grainger’s plans include nearly 200 homes, not one of which will be at council rent. The architects’ drawings show a Costa and a “Pasta Express”. It is BlandTown, and Labour signed off on the lot. The politician who has done most for the largely Corbyn-supporting traders is a Tory: Boris Johnson, as London mayor, decreed that the indoor market had to be protected.Like many of the headaches that await Prime Minister Jez, this was one Ejiofor’s team inherited. The complication is that a key part of the land, which sits right above a tube line, is owned by Sadiq Khan’s Transport for London (TfL). Yet the Corbyn council has made the issue worse. It needed someone in charge of regeneration who was allergic to the charms of property developers, but the new leader has instead appointed Charles Adje. Just a few years ago Adje was suspended as a councillor for covering up an official note warning against giving a licence to an especially controversial developer. Asked about this, the council says Adje “made an error of judgment”.Very little of that money seems to have been reinvested in the market: carpet tiles are broken and filthy and the electrics keep breaking, so the cafes and butchers’ foodstuffs rot. Questioned about this and other issues, Owen offered no comment. When traders asked last month whether the drains could be unblocked, Owen’s reply was: “When was the last time you cleared the drains in your house?”This is the Corbyn council’s first big test, and handling it ought to be simple. They’re supposed to take the side of the people, not builders. Their manifesto promises: “Where we have to regenerate parts of the borough, we will bring residents with us.” At a meeting this summer opened by Corbyn ally Chris Williamson, Labour members across the borough voted to stop any demolition of Latin Village, and to save it as a “cultural asset”. Ejiofor’s team has a mandate it’s just not upholding it.Rather than taking up the traders’ case, Ejiofor and Adje have fobbed them off. Instead of Haringey cracking down on the market manager, last month it sent an enforcement officer to hassle traders. A pregnant woman running a nail bar was found without a licence, and told to close the shop. In a complaint that I have seen, she said she had felt “embarrassed and humiliated” in front of customers and neighbours. Days later, she miscarried.This small story carries big lessons for all those hoping for a radical alternative in national government. Ask Haringey cabinet members why they have handled this so badly, and they complain about having a plateful of poison pills left by the last lot. One says: “It’s so difficult to shift the bureaucracy.” Any Corbyn administration will face both of these problems, multiplied a hundredfold.None of the above is intended to damn a council leadership that’s only five months old and which has some good ideas about cutting council tax for the working poor. Nor is it meant to put on the frighteners about a Corbyn government. But any new Labour administration will be judged on how much change it makes for the people it claims to represent, and how far it represents the social movements whose energy it draws upon. This is the age-old tension of Labour in government, and it will be felt especially keenly by a social-movement politician like Corbyn.Locally or nationally, no radical government will have it easy. Money will be tight, and Britain has political and economic structural problems that will take decades to put right. Which is why the case of the Latin Village is so instructive. A council must be able to pick the right side in a fight as small as this. It ought to be able to follow some basic principles. Let traders run their own market, and invest in the Latin Village as a local gem. A bit of imagination, a dollop of willpower, lashings of principle. The Corbyn council should learn from this case. Its supporters expect better the traders deserve better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f860ffb80abaa6ece15e271b97471961b11c2835/268_482_4916_2950/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7c689586dcf383a99bdafa9fa4c883a","title":"nationalising britain water industry environment","story":"We should resist simplistic calls in England and Wales for state ownership that wouldn’t automatically clean up our waterThere has been much discussion about the potential ownership structures of the water sector in England and Wales over recent months, but there has been very little thought given to actual operation of the industry.And nowhere is this clearer than when it comes to the environment. It simply isn’t good enough to assert that a change of ownership would automatically lead to a cleaning-up of the natural water environment, an acute issue given the challenges of climate change, particularly when we look back at what has driven the considerable progress on overcoming environmental challenges over the past 30 years.Throughout much of the 20th century our rivers and beaches were in a state of crisis. The Thames was declared dead in the 1950s. In 1988, more than a third of our beaches fell below legal standards. But today, less than half a per cent don’t make the grade, thanks in large part to almost £30bn of investment in the environment since privatisation.But this change hasn’t come in a vacuum. EU regulations have played a crucial role in raising standards and driving changes to the structures of the water sector. The realisation that the vast costs associated with meeting these standards could not be met by government funds strengthened significantly the case for private investment in that sense, privatisation in the late 1980s was a pragmatic response to an environmental imperative.Even now, however, the need for investment is as pressing as ever. There is a lot more to do as far as our waterways are concerned. That is why we must not only maintain the standards we have achieved, but also ensure the water industry does not fall prey to ideological siren calls for nationalisation when the focus should be on how best to improve on present standards.As a report from Green Alliance, From Blue to Green: how to get the best from the environment from spending on water, clearly explains, instead of going backwards we need to build on the progress over the past 30 years to encourage and support every farmer to manage their land in a way that respects the water environment. We need to continue and extend that work, helping farmers to provide effective stewardship of their land. In so doing, we will further reduce pollution of our watercourses and, of course, reduce pressure on water bills.The agriculture bill is being debated by MPs today, and we must take this opportunity to ensure that common agricultural policy subsidies are reformed so that good farming practices are rewarded where they increase environmental standards.We must also ensure that we do not go back to a system of ownership in which the water sector will always lose out when in competition for scarce government funds with schools and hospitals.That is why, as a passionate environmentalist and champion of real investment in our public services, I do not want to go back to the 1980s when the UK was called the “dirty man of Europe”, with beaches overflowing with sewage, filthy rivers, excessive power station emissions and a poor conservation framework.When it comes to ensuring we have clean water and a safe marine environment we cannot allow ideology to be the master of fact. That means resisting those who wish to reduce standards just as forcefully as we should resist simplistic calls for state ownership.To further improve our rivers and beaches we need real investment supported by smart and efficient regulation, not dogma. It is about time we focused our minds on the issues at hand, and that means reaching for pragmatic and workable solutions to the challenges facing the natural environment.• Angela Smith is the Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on water• This article was corrected on 10 October to 2018.

I respect their decision and want to make sure they get the best possible outcome from this process.However, there is no way I will prop up this government and rescue the prime minister by supporting their dog’s dinner of a Brexit deal that would leave my constituents and the rest of the country far worse off. No one voted to be poorer.If ever proof were needed that those around the Conservative leadership are deluded, it is the idea that Labour MPs like me would let them off the hook by supporting a Tory hard Brexit.We are now more than two years on from the referendum and the only certainty about the government’s Brexit deal is that it will be far worse than our current membership of the EU.I do believe the EU needs reform. Yet the way things are heading we stand to lose all of the benefits of EU membership with none of the prizes promised by leave campaigners such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.The impact of this would be felt in lost growth and lost jobs. Meanwhile, the most difficult decisions about our future relationship with the EU – from how to avoid a hard border in Ireland to what our trade or immigration policy should be – will be kicked into the long grass.This means we would be walking out the door blindfolded, with no idea where we will end up. In no way does that provide us and thousands of businesses with the certainty that we so desperately need.We know some changes that are already happening as a result of Brexit. Food prices are rising in the shops and some firms are finding it harder to recruit workers.As chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, I have heard evidence about how drug companies are having to stockpile medicines and of the uncertainty surrounding the supply chains in the aviation and car industries.According to some experts, Brexit is already costing taxpayers about £500m a week in lost growth. That is very different from the £350m “idend” slogan splashed across a bus during the referendum campaign.That is why I am supporting a “people’s vote” on the final Brexit deal. We need to ensure the people get the last word on this huge decision. By supporting a people’s vote, I am not looking to rerun the referendum. But the leave campaign did make a host of promises that we now know will not happen.It is crystal clear the reality of what Brexit will mean is very different from what we were told in 2016.There is far too much at stake for everyone across the country to allow a Brexit deal to be decided at Westminster alone.If 650 MPs in Westminster get to vote on such a seismic decision affecting the future of our country, it is only fair that everyone else should play their part too.And, if the prime minister is so confident that whatever the outcome of these negotiations will be the best deal, then she should not fear the public having the final say on proposals that will have such a massive impact on their lives.Instead of grubbing around and trying to persuade Labour MPs to support her failed strategy, May should not be frit of a people’s vote.

Vogue Hommes Paris addressed this notion with the cover line: “Chic is back.” The Row, the women’s label by the Olsen twins, known for luxury minimalism, is launching menswear, while Riccardo Tisci’s first Burberry show last month featured a series of very restrained looks built around clean lines and tailoring. The concept of chic to me is the French actor Louis Garrel in an overcoat, vintage Jil Sander or an “easy suit” look. The latter is achievable via Arket (sizes come up small) and Cos, which both offer modern versions of tailored jackets that feel relaxed rather than stuffy. And after all, ease is surely the epitome of chic.I’ll keep this brief. There is nothing exciting to say about Chelsea boots or cult flashy sneakers. Instead, buy some shoes or boots that have a chunky sole – something that makes you walk as if you’re taking part in a Rick Owens show. The brand Marsèll is very good at this, as is Prada.

As Neil Armstrong biopic First Man explores, for those left at home, it is quite literally the world’s most long-distance relationshipIn 1966, three years before her husband, Neil, became the first person to walk on the moon, Janet Armstrong was pictured at home by Life magazine. Neil was in orbit in the Gemini 8 spacecraft, but it had started to spin dangerously out of control. Suddenly, his safe return was in doubt.At that moment, to protect Janet and the family from any bad news, Neil’s Nasa bosses restricted the family’s access to its live radio feed, known as the “squawk box”.Life magazine showed her kneeling in front of the device, as if praying for Neil’s safe return. In fact, she was furious. “I was on my knees there with my eyes closed trying to concentrate on what was being said,” she later explained. “But it came out that I was in a praying position and blah, blah, blah. Well, that’s not true.” Later, she would confront Nasa bosses and warn them not to pull a similar stunt again.It’s a small story, one of hundreds of tiny insights in the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, which has now been adapted into a film. Small, but significant, as the psychological effects of being an astronaut, or the family of an astronaut, are rarely explored.In this instance, the mass media were camped in the living room of a mother of two living sons and one daughter, who died aged two from a brain tumour four years previously. The photographer is watching through the lens as Janet tries to establish whether she will ever see her husband again.While he’s certainly having a bad day at the office, it’s no picnic for the loved ones he left at home, either.“It can be harder for the ones left behind than the one doing it,” says psychotherapist Jennie Miller. “If you’re the one doing it, you have a sense of some control, of having been trained to do your level best to get back. With control we get a sense of being OK. It’s the difference between learning to drive a car and being a passenger. But if you’re the loved one, you have zero control.”Janet Armstrong was an intelligent, thoughtful woman whose frustration at her treatment by both Nasa and her husband occasionally pokes through even the sanitised Life magazine interviews conducted between 1966 and 1969.“People are always asking me what it is like to be married to an astronaut,” Janet told the magazine. “What it’s like for me to be the wife of Neil Armstrong is the more appropriate question.”In public, common with the other wives of astronauts, Janet maintained the wholesome picture-postcard image of the all-American family. In private, many of the wives felt like they didn’t have much say in what was going on. “We would meet over in the Nasa auditorium,” she is quoted as saying in First Man. “We would get all dressed up and we would have to put our gloves on to get, what I felt was, lectured: ‘Keep a stiff upper lip, girls.’”Why would Janet always be the one to confront authority? Perhaps, says psychotherapist Miller, the roots of her outspokenness lay in the premature death of her daughter, Karen Anne.“The impact of losing a child can sometimes affect people in remarkable ways. They think: ‘I’ve experienced the worst pain that life can throw at me, so I don’t give a damn what you think about me any more.’“I live and work near Portsmouth naval base, so I see couples who don’t see each other for 18 months, or even two years at a time. While they’re not going to the moon, it’s not that dissimilar. Even when an astronaut is home, with all the training and so on, I imagine their head is in a different place.”It’s a theory borne out by the recollections of astronaut Gene Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, the last lunar mission.But could such problems be avoided, and how would an expert today prepare families for what lies ahead?“If you’re going to do work like that, you’d want to talk to someone before any training begins and prepare people for the impact on their lives,” Miller says. “If I were seeing a couple like this, I’d do empathy work with the pair of them, so they each get a sense of what it is like to be the other. In the case of the Armstrongs, he needs to realise that she’s lost a child, and she may now lose a husband in such a public way.”When a couple are facing a big challenge, what can happen is that each withdraws into themselves and they build up too solid a boundary in order to survive, in order not to be vulnerable. You need to make sure you let the right people in.”This one small step could be a giant leap.First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae30f616f41550d91d8cccd3ab4bf2abab730cc/0_825_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c04fc6fd4c000c0b27e558d5d63e7c","title":"why the moon landing was a giant leap for mankind","story":"Forty-nine years after Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first man to walk on the moon, new film First Man proves the event is still one of the most significant achievements of humanityNeil Armstrong was the first man on the moon and the master of the understatement. “It, you know, was a pretty simple statement, talking about stepping off something,” he later said when asked about his legendary first words on the lunar surface. “It was what it was.”Shrewdly chosen by Nasa to make that mission work – to troubleshoot unpredictable life and death situations on the fly and to represent not just America but the world – Armstrong was unquestionably the man for the job. Flying to the moon, landing and walking on it, let alone getting home safely, was man conquering the impossible. The stuff of dreams. Science fiction author Arthur C Clarke wrote that, from then on, history and fiction had “become inexorably linked”.Despite his humility, Armstrong had spent some time thinking of what he might say when he stepped on to the moon – he knew what it meant. “Humankind has had some amazing journeys,” says James Hansen, professor of history at Alabama’s Auburn University and author of the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, from which Damien Chazelle’s film First Man is adapted. “There have been major technological events. Splitting the atom. But going to the moon, it’s kind of like the Chinese stepping off the Formosa straits for the first time. The major movement of peoples. The Vikings making it all the way to Greenland. These amazing stories of humanity moving and seeking and exploring. If we just stay put in one place, we don’t learn. To have our species leaving our own planet and stepping on to another heavenly body for the first time, it’s a major event in the history of humankind. Neil certainly recognised that, and I think he built that into the words that he said when he walked off the lunar module on to the surface.”The world witnessed Armstrong’s great leap: nearly 600 million rapt people, a fifth of the planet’s population back then, were glued to their radios and televisions, all experiencing the event. John F Kennedy had, in 1961, promised that it would happen by the end of the decade: “The eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond,” he said. Nasa then raced to make that wild promise a reality, and not without loss of life along the way. But the world needed it.“It was a time of such incredibly high tension nationally and internationally, and I think everyone felt we were right on the brink of potential world war III,” said Armstrong in 2001. “I don’t think anybody, even the people in the backwoods of Montana, were unaware of this tension. I was very aware of it.” Getting to the moon, he thought, could transcend it all. Armstrong was a fighter pilot between 1950 and 1952, flying 78 missions in the Korean war before he was 22. “He never showed any fear in any of his close calls,” said his brother Dean. He became a research pilot for Nasa, flying more than 200 different aircraft before becoming an astronaut. “The unknowns were rampant,” he later said of the moon landing, but he batted off phantom computer alarms, enormous boulders and just 20 seconds of fuel remaining as he touched down. “The Eagle has landed,” he radioed to Houston. “You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we’re breathing again,” the controller responded.First Man is a soulful, sensitive portrayal of Armstrong’s personal journey, with Damien Chazelle focusing on Armstrong’s intimate thoughts and feelings, bringing one of history’s most iconic moments down to Earth. “This was a feat beyond imagination – it was truly a giant leap for mankind,” says Chazelle. “This film is about one of the most extraordinary accomplishments not only in American history, but in human history. My hope is that by digging under the surface and humanising the icon, we can better understand just how difficult, audacious and heroic this moment really was.”By concentrating on the man, Chazelle makes his film resonate for all of us – as the event itself did 49 years ago. “The plaque left on the leg of the lunar lander said: ‘Here, men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. We came in peace for all mankind,’” says Hansen. “This was a human achievement that we all share. It was a moment of global commonality and consciousness, something we all participated in. It was a brief pause in all the disillusion of humankind – we all took a breath and stepped away and saw that we had something very much in common.”With men having set foot on the moon, anything seemed possible. The future had begun, and with it a world of opportunity. To experience it was to be inspired. “He changed the world. And, of course, he certainly changed me,” wrote science communicator Bill Nye after Armstrong died in 2012. “Neil Armstrong raised the expectations, the hopes and dreams of every human on Earth. Thanks to him, we all believe that humans can achieve great things, that we can learn about our place among the stars, that we can all reach up and out, that we can fly, and change the world.”First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aea184ef772189bd130c6052f5a90e258323bca/0_209_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecb9cba522481d59cee256e2a60c7abe 1010w","title":"nigel slater vegetables in coconut sauce recipe","story":"Carrots and green beans and a lovely array of fresh bright spices combine in this midweek veggie feastMake a spice paste: peel a large banana shallot and place in the bowl of a food processor together with 2 peeled cloves of garlic, 50 cashews, 1 small, hot, red chilli, 2 tsp of ground turmeric, 20g of peeled ginger, 10g of galangal and 2 stalks of lemongrass.

Lightly grease a 20cm springform cake tin with oil or butter.Put the biscuits in a resealable bag, seal and bash with a rolling pin to yield a mix of crumbs and slightly larger lumps – you can use a food processor, if you like, but take care not to break down the biscuits too much. (Use just digestives, ginger nuts or other biscuits entirely if you prefer, but I think this combination gives the perfect texture and flavour.)Melt the butter in a small pan or in the microwave. Put the biscuit crumbs into a bowl and pour in the butter, plus a pinch of salt, and mix well to combine. Spoon into the greased tin, spread out and use the bottom of a glass to press it down to make a firm, compact base, going slightly up the sides, if necessary.Put the tin on the tray in the hot oven and bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the topping. Drain off any excess liquid from the cheese, if need be, then put it in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon to loosen, before whisking to get rid of any lumps.Put the cornflour and sugar in a medium bowl, then whisk in the sour cream a bit at a time, until well combined. Mix into the cream cheese, along with the vanilla extract and lemon zest. (Play with the flavourings: orange or lime zest are also nice, particularly with chocolate biscuits, or use orange flower water or a pinch of nutmeg instead of the vanilla.)Beat the whole eggs in a bowl – keep back the white for later – then gradually whisk into the cheese mixture, making sure each addition is incorporated before adding the next. Beat until creamy and smooth without any lumps. Taste (provided you don’t mind raw eggs) and add more zest, vanilla or sugar, if you like.Put the egg white in a bowl and whisk briefly to loosen. Take the tin out of the oven, leaving the baking sheet in there, and turn down the temperature to 130C260Fgas ½. Brush the egg white over the base, being very gentle so as not to disturb the crumb, then leave to sit while the oven cools.Pour the cheese mixture into the tin and shake gently to help level it out. Skim a finger across the top to get rid of any air bubbles, then return the tin to the oven for about 90 minutes, until the filling is set, but still slightly wobbly in the middle. Once it’s done, turn off the oven and take out the tin.Run a small palette or butter knife around the edge of the cake, then put it back in the oven and leave to cool completely before releasing the cheesecake from its tin: this should stop the top cracking. If it does so regardless, a dollop of fruit compote or an artfully placed handful of fresh berries will hide a multitude of sins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/778c6c23b0e143e78ca28705a8def1e225e4f40f/0_218_4788_2874/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f87d5d1510fbb7229b2cce8e454c7423","title":"portsmouth buzz back football league blog","story":"Pompey are top of League One and in no mood to stop after a change of ownership and a show of faith in young talentPortsmouth have done it all in recent years – a crash course in the good, the bad and the ugly – but things are seemingly on the up as they look down on the rest of League One, sitting pretty after one defeat in 12 matches.It is six years since Portsmouth suffered the first of two consecutive relegations, dropping from the Championship into League One, and five since the Portsmouth Supporters Trust saved a club left black and blue by previous regimes from liquidation.Later that year, in November 2013, Portsmouth’s current longest-serving player, Jack Whatmough, made his debut, having witnessed the club’s sorry slide, after winning the FA Cup in 2008, first-hand.“In my second year as a scholar, we used to get changed at Fratton Park in the away dressing room and the coaches at the time, Paul Hardyman and Andy Awford, would call contacts they knew to try to find somewhere to train on the day,” Whatmough, the Gosport-born defender who joined aged 12, says. “A lot of the time it was down at Eastney Barracks, the old naval base. Another day we just trained on the club car park. We had a jog, a stretch and that was all we could do. There have been some really tough times.”Portsmouth plummeted through the isions and, while their troubles badly hindered them, it forced them to turn to the next generation. Whatmough, as well as Ben Close, Brad Tarbuck, Jed Wallace and Conor Chaplin, were thrown in at the deep end. “In a selfish way, it gave a lot of young lads the opportunity to get into the first team, because the club didn’t have money to sign players that they wanted to,” Whatmough says.PST succeeded not only in its determination to consign the dark days of winding-up orders and points deductions to the past but also in stabilising the club. Paul Cook steered them out of League Two last year and by the time the Tornante investment group, led by the former Disney chief executive, Michael Eisner, acquired the club a few months on, Pompey were a different proposition.In good hands and health, Portsmouth find themselves fine-tuning things as they make a tilt for promotion. “To be in the situation where we are now is credit to the players, the staff and the board above, who are backing the club to spend money and to do what they’re doing,” Whatmough says. “Whatever they’re doing at the moment, it seems to be working from the top down. It’s nice to be a part of and where the club is now compared to where it’s been before, it’s a massive step up. With the way the club is going now, it’s enjoyable to be a part of it.”They plan on investing further, with Fratton Park desperately in need of refurbishment. There have been conversations with architects over a redesign and Eisner has stated his first choice is to stay in their mystical 119-year-old home.As Eric, Eisner’s son and a club director, recently alluded, there is a long way to go. “In one year we are falling more in love with it, and the fans. It seems like we’re in the first quarter, the beginning of the game,” he said. For Portsmouth that is the exciting bit.Of all of their investments, the £100,000 they paid Derry City for Ronan Curtis in May looks increasingly ingenious. The additions of Lee Brown and Nathan Thompson were smart but the Croydon-born winger, who moved to Ireland at the age of eight, lit up the league on arrival. He has scored six goals and set up five others, earning him a call-up to Martin O’Neill’s senior squad in September. “It’s been a great year,” says Curtis, whose godfather is the former Wales manager, Chris Coleman.In five years at Derry the 22-year-old made a lasting impression and scored in the Europa League against Midtjylland. Curtis also played with Patrick McClean, the younger brother of the Stoke forward, James, who, along with the Everton defender Seamus Coleman, helped him settle at international level. For his club Curtis has gone from playing in front of 2,000 to almost 20,000. “It’s just a different kettle of fish over here in England, a different type of professional set-up. Your washing gets done for you, there’s lunch, dinner for you and all those little things. You don’t have to clean your own boots and stuff like that.”Along with Jamal Lowe, the forward who was playing for sixth-tier Hampton \u0026amp Richmond Borough until last year, and the captain Brett Pitman, the striker who scored 14 goals to help Bournemouth into the Premier League in 2015, Curtis has formed a free-scoring triumvirate that has primed Portsmouth for a return to the Championship. Until defeat at home to Gillingham last weekend, Kenny Jackett’s side were unbeaten this season.“The club is massive and hopefully we can get back to where we belong,” Curtis says. “There is a great buzz. It does feel special.”• Sunderland have soared towards the top of League One, with the teenage striker Josh Maja instrumental in their good form. The 19-year-old has scored four times in his past four games, taking his tally to nine goals for the season. The former Fulham youngster made his debut in 2016 and has referenced Jermain Defoe’s role in his development. “Jermain was a big role model for me and he supported me while I was moving up to the first team,” he said.• Hull City Supporters’ Trust is preparing a £45m takeover of the Championship club, with a UKUS consortium, made up of investors in the sports crowd micro-financing business SportyCo, set to meet the owner Assem Allam next week. Allam’s son, Ehab, speaking last month, said: “I would like think there is hope for us to move the club on this year.”• Forest Green Rovers are the last unbeaten team standing in the EFL, after 12 league matches this season. “Let’s kick on, let’s go and get another 12 games,” the manager, Mark Cooper, said after a draw at Newport on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855ad0e13cd95de7fe8debbd042f284c4554a4f9/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e060b665961ad2e36a444d2723fc112","title":"next generation 2018 20 of the best talents at premier league clubs","story":" picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

But a few easy tweaks could bring it all back under controlYou have Marie Kondoed your wardrobe, recycled your old newspapers and taken unwanted books to the charity shop. It may feel as if you have succeeded in decluttering your life, but then you turn on your phone or open up your laptop and find a whole load more to tidy up.Sometimes, it gets out of control. Just this week, the snappily named European Problematic Use of the Internet Research Network warned of the dangers of “cyberhoarding”, an inability to delete information gathered online. Researchers weren’t sure whether this was a new condition or an extension of a more common offline affliction.For most of us, though, there is hope: just a few easy tweaks (and a couple of harder ones) can help you to get your cybercollections under control.If you have used a smartphone for any length of time, you probably have pages upon pages of apps installed and little appetite for imposing any order on them. You may, just about, have a home screen you’re happy with, but everything else lies in a jumbled mess, with the apps arranged vaguely in the order in which they were installed. Or perhaps remnants of earlier organisation attempts, in the form of mostly empty folders.Here’s the solution: arrange the icons for aesthetics, not use, and then ignore the home screen entirely and search for anything you need to use. My phone has all its apps sorted into 12 folders, based on colour: blue apps, green apps, orange apps and so on. If I need an app, I use the search bar. Usually, the app is already there because your phone knows a scary amount about you, and can predict your needs better than your own mother if not, just a couple of clicks will bring it up. And if you have forgotten its name, well, you can probably remember the colour of the icon, right?The digital desktop is a lot like the real one. For some people, it’s a space to be kept clean and ordered, a substrate on which work rests. “A disordered desk is an evidence of a disordered brain,” as the saying goes. (Prompting the obvious question: “What does an empty desk show?”) For others, it’s a handy flat surface on which any and all documents are kept, for ever. You may be one of those people who make others scream when they use your computer for the first time.The real solution is the same on and offline: clear your desk, you slob. But if you want a slightly quicker answer, try the harried office worker’s solution and put everything in little piles.Mac users who upgrade to the latest version of the operating system, Mojave, can simply right-click on the desktop and select “Use stacks”. By default, that shuffles all the files on the desktop into small pseudo-folders, arranged by file type. If you’re not a Mac user, or can’t upgrade to Mojave, there’s nothing else quite so snappy, but it’s fairly easy to do approximately the same thing. Just right click on the desktop and select “Sort by kind” or “Sort by file type”, then drag files into a few folders manually. The trick is to not overthink it: come up with a simple sorting scheme you can do without thinking, rather than a complex one that takes mental energy to implement.The boulder of a modern Sisyphus is his or her email inbox. Unlike everything else on this list, an email inbox isn’t under your control: whether and when it gets filled is entirely up to others, making regulating the flow a spirit-sapping challenge.One trick is to accept that lack of control and move on from the inbox. Many of us use our inboxes as a to-do list. But a to-do list that can be added to by strangers at any time, day or night, is a recipe for disaster. Instead, use a real to-do list and leave the inbox to its fate as a quagmire.Or take the other approach and bring it under control with the nuclear option: email bankruptcy. Just a few clicks is all it takes to select every email you have received and delete the lot. Just a few more clicks, and you can send a short email to everyone you know, asking them to resend anything important. If they don’t, it wasn’t worth reading in the first place.A less extreme form of the same result can be achieved by taking advantage of natural breaks in your work: holidays, illnesses and the like. When you get back from the time away, you can use your departure date as the cutoff: anything sent before you left wasn’t urgent enough to do before your holiday and is probably obsolete. So delete it. And if it isn’t, well, they’ll get in touch again.It’s easy to justify photo hoarding. The point of photos is to store treasured memories, so surely the more the better? But with smartphones, the quantity can end up becoming overwhelming, leaving even the good memories impossible to find. Worse still, the ballooning storage space required can begin to exert its own pressure.The trick isn’t to clear out your collection – it is to bring in someone else to act as digital archivist for you. If you let them, Apple (for iOS users) and Google (for Android and Windows users) have solutions. The first thing to do is embrace the cloud – even if it means paying a bit. For £2.50 a month, Apple gives iOS users enough storage space to store all the pictures they could ever take (and to make backups of their devices to boot). The same service is free with Google, but, as ever, you pay with your data: the search firm will use your uploaded images to improve its own machine learning systems.Then let the algorithms do the curation for you. Apple and Google Photos offer features that would have seemed magical just a decade ago, from text search for images (letting you find “dogs”, “Christmas” or “beach holidays”) to automatic selection of pictures – algorithmically trimming your 500 holiday pictures to just 40 or so interesting ones.One of the trickier things about digital clutter is that it’s possible to build it up without knowing or meaning to. Every day, as we go about our lives, we leave a trail of data behind us. At best, it doesn’t help us, just those who harvest it and at worst, the information can be actively dangerous if it gets stolen.Did you know, for instance, that Google tracks your location? Even if you told it not to? Or that Facebook uses information others give it about you to target adverts?So delete it. Unless you are consciously building an archive, or will definitely need access to the data in the future, it’s probably in your interest to clear up that data exhaust. That means deleting historical tweets and old Facebook posts, closing accounts for services you aren’t using and maybe even spinning up new accounts periodically to thwart the creepier web giants out there.

Those forced to live in ever smaller spaces describe how this changes their livesJenny had run out of choices when she first walked into her basement studio flat last spring. The charity worker had been kicked out of her shared home in Bristol when her landlord sold it. She was on benefits, having been signed off sick with post-traumatic stress and anxiety after giving evidence as a victim of crime.While being put up on a friend’s sofa, Jenny, who is 35 but does not want to use her real name for fear of jeopardising her tenancy, scoured online sites for rooms within her budget. Housing benefit claimants in the city can generally receive up to £300 a month for shared accommodation. “Rooms here were going for anywhere from £400, but even if I had that money, I could be rejected because I’m on benefits,” Jenny says.Desperate and confined to private rented accommodation (Bristol has more than 11,000 families on the waiting list for social housing), Jenny learned that she just about qualified for the higher allowance for a one-bedroom flat, as a single occupant aged 35 or over. This pushed her budget above £500 a month. After finding her landlord on a Facebook community group, Jenny had a home. The payoff would be space. “What I didn’t know is how isolated and trapped it would make me feel,” she says.Jenny pays £475 a month, excluding bills, for one of the smallest of nine flats carved out of a Victorian terraced house on a busy road. One of them is not more than a glorified shed crammed into the garden. She doesn’t know the floor area, but planning documents show that her room, which includes a double bed, kitchen sink, hob, oven, washing machine and a clothes rail, covers 15 sq metres. The tiny, windowless bathroom adds 3 sq m. Her whole home is barely bigger than the average living room and would fit 14 times on to a tennis court.“When I come home I feel this sense of doom,” Jenny says. “I can’t have the window open because I’m on a noisy, polluted road, and I can’t have the blinds open because there’s a bus stop right there. I’ve had people weeing on my doorstep, doing crack outside my front door.” There are practical challenges. Jenny eats on her bed, which, like her clothes and everything else she owns, smells of whatever she cooks. Without proper storage, anything out of place can make the flat feel chaotic. The hum of the fridge keeps her awake at night.“I think that even if someone didn’t suffer from anxiety or depression, living in this flat would affect them mentally,” she says, wondering how she might start to recover in a house like this. “You feel it – oh my God, the air is so … heavy.”Britain’s housing crisis is pushing more of us into shoebox homes. Houses are shrinking, too. In 2014, the average new-build in the UK was 76 sq m, the smallest in Europe (Danish homes were almost double the size, research by the University of Cambridge showed). The average living room in a house built in the 1970s, meanwhile, was 25 sq m, compared to 17 today, according to LABC Warranty, which provides warranties for new-builds.But it is the slicing and dicing of houses – and, increasingly, office buildings – that is redefining the whole idea of home, recalling a dark era of tenements and rookeries. For some residents, it is a money-saving endurance test of the sort many of us consider a rite of passage. For others, it can feel like the walls are closing in and there is no way out. “I’m lucky I have a roof over my head but that’s about as far as it goes,” Jenny says.There have been attempts for more than a century to promote space standards for homes. In 1912, Raymond Unwin, the architect and planner best known for the garden city movement, wrote: Nothing Gained by Overcrowding!, a pamphlet on the subject. In the same year, the Local Government Board recommended that no house should be smaller than 79.4 sq m. Flats appeared in space guidelines in a 1961 report of the Parker Morris committee. One-person, single-storey flats should be at least 29.7 sq m, it said, with 2.6 sq m of storage – double the size of Jenny’s home.But standards and ideals can get blurred in a vicious economic cycle. Ministers relax planning rules to enable more building and development. Developers and landlords find profitable loopholes in those changes. Local authorities, desperate for alternatives to their own dwindling housing stock, direct residents to those landlords, fuelling further exploitation at a time when councils also lack resources for planning and building control. Residents, often faced with homelessness, endure the cramped results, until society notices and someone writes another report.“My concern is that people are becoming inured to something that they shouldn’t have to put up with,” says Julia Park, the head of housing research at architectural firm Levitt Bernstein. She has written a history of space standards and is surprised by how little we consider the effects of domestic confinement. “When you’re living in smaller and smaller flats, you reach a point where it makes sense to take out the walls because one big room feels nicer, but I think that implies a lot of compromise we’re not examining,” she says. “Some of these flats pose threats to physical health, but, in small spaces, it’s going to be mental health that is most affected.”Elsewhere in Bristol, Chris, 24, shares a tiny flat with his girlfriend. The couple have a separate bedroom, but there is barely space to move between the bed and walls. The kitchen and living area is equally small, and there is no chance of spending any time apart when they are both at home. Chris also suffers from anxiety, while his girlfriend has an eating disorder.“When I’m feeling stressed and anxious in the outside world, it’s important for me to have a base where I feel comfortable,” says Chris, who has just quit a job handling complaints for a train company. “If I come home to an uncomfortable sofa that has stuff on it so I have to walk around it, and navigate wires everywhere, it makes me more irritable and it’s harder to decompress.” Kitchen clutter can affect his girlfriend’s eating disorder: “She can end up avoiding eating or not eating at all for hours because, if it doesn’t feel right, there will be a reaction,” Chris says.Park, who advises local authorities, laments the way sleeping, cooking and washing are increasingly viewed as the only functions of a dwelling in a housing market where a living room is becoming a luxury. She is especially worried about the types of homes that have emerged in the gaps in policy. This summer she noticed a seven-floor former office block in Ilford, east London, which had been ided into flats. Planning records showed that each of the six upper floors in the building had been converted into 10 studios, including single flats of just 13 sq m.By current standards, these flats are barely a third of the recommended size. Park was instrumental in drawing up the “nationally described space standard”, a nationwide metric implemented by the government in 2015. It recommends 37 sq m for a one-person, one-bedroom flat a two-person, one-bedroom flat should be 50 sq m.Park was surprised that the government had agreed to the recommendations, given its austerity policies. “The compromise was that it is optional,” she adds, estimating that fewer than half of councils have adopted it. Even when they do, it only applies to new buildings or developments that go through the planning system, but not to a range of “permitted developments”. So, for a relatively small investment, the owner of an office building, for example, can convert it into self-contained flats with only “prior notification”.Ben Clifford led a team that visited more than 500 converted office buildings for a report published last May by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. “We were shocked by how many of these flats were of a very poor quality,” says Clifford, a senior lecturer in spatial planning and government at University College London’s Bartlett school of planning. In one, Clifford called the fire brigade after spotting walls iding flats made only of plywood. “We spoke to one resident who was in a tiny one-bed flat with two children and no balconies or open space,” he says. “Another woman, in an 80s office building, said it just wasn’t very nice to live in a flat with big tinted windows that don’t open.”In the so-called “lockdown” model, meanwhile, rogue landlords are converting family homes into tiny studio flats specifically to attract tenants aged 35 or over who, like Jenny, claim the higher housing allowance for a self-contained dwelling. By including a token shared facility, such as a tiny kitchen – or by ignoring rules altogether – these landlords also bypass planning permission by treating such developments as flat-shares (another permitted development). The rental income from six cheaply built studios is multiples of that for a three-bed flat share in the same house – and it is the taxpayer who lines the landlord’s pockets. “It’s basically the warehousing of homelessness,” says Jon Knowles, a computer analyst and campaigner who has recorded hundreds of such developments.Park accepts that homes smaller than 37 sq m can be a useful, short-term base for people in need, as part of the response to the housing crisis and high-quality “micro” apartments are increasingly marketed as aspirational. Park’s own son, Jack, this summer moved into a flat about the same size as Jenny’s. But, in his case, downsizing was a choice. The primary school teacher, who is 28, was paying £600 a month for a small room in a flat-share in south-east London. He wanted to work less as a supply teacher to free up time for his art and a possible masters degree and now pays £350 for a 13-15 sq m studio in Liverpool. His metal sink has a draining board that incorporates two electric hobs. There is no oven.“I’m not that fussy about where I live and if I wanted to work a bit less and save money, it was only possible in a place like this,” Jack says. “But if it was forced on me, I might resent all sorts of things about it.” He says he could not tolerate the space if he had a partner.Chris, who pays £625 a month for his flat in an old house, says enforced proximity makes arguments tough. “If you’re feeling distant from one another it’s blown out of proportion hugely because you’re in the same room because you have to be,” he says. A social life is challenging, too the couple have a small blow-up mattress for guests, but the only bathroom is accessed through the bedroom, around the bed. Hosting dinners is out of the question.For Jenny, this also fuels a sense of isolation. “I can’t even have someone for a cup of tea,” she says. “When people do come over I feel shame because of how small it is, and everything feels dirty because as soon as people come in they are instantly in my bedroom with their shoes.”Few housing campaigners have much hope that conditions might soon improve for the occupants of our shrinking homes. Clifford says there is a minor backlash against abuses of the permitted development rules, and several local authorities are moving against them. “We have to be much tougher on landlords and on standards,” Park says. “There are going to be compromises because we are desperately short of housing, but we cannot give people a free pass.”For Jenny, the future – near and far – feels uncertain. “I know I’ll never be able to afford to buy anywhere, or even to rent this place without help with benefits at the moment,” she says. “But I don’t want to be on benefits.” She has started doing volunteer work with a learning disabilities charity while she considers applying for jobs. She goes to the library and takes regular walks. “Or I’ll go to a friend’s place and instantly, when I’m out of the house or in a larger space, I’ll feel a hundred times better,” she adds. “But then I’ll have to go home.”• This article was amended on 10 October 2018 to change a reference to an “office block in Croydon” to Ilford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e4814c9d553f2c701a96cea9edf0b4d641068d/0_0_860_516/master/860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdb63559f96ed279d3834ba089d97f08","title":"brexit supporters realism remainers impressionism art study sociologists","story":"Experts say findings reflect difference between social conservatives and liberalsBrexit supporters are more likely than remainers to prefer artworks that realistically depict their subjects to more impressionistic paintings, according to a study from three Oxford University sociologists.The researchers surveyed thousands of British voters, asking them to pick their favourite painting from four pairs of artworks – each containing one realistic image – from artists including Thomas Kinkade and Michael Klein, and one impressionist work from artists such as Francis Bacon and Mark Rothko.In their paper, Preference for realistic art predicts support for Brexit, they found those who preferred all four of the realistic paintings “were a full 20 percentage points more likely to support leave” than those who preferred all four, or three of the four, impressionist paintings – even when the data is controlled for a number of characteristics that might otherwise explain the difference, including gender, age group, education, ethnicity and country of birth.The difference, the researchers wrote, “was approximately equal to the difference in likelihood of supporting leave between those with a university degree and those with no educational qualifications”. Most importantly, the distinction even holds (with a 15 percentage-point difference) when controlling for traditional party identity, meaning it shows more than simple leftright aesthetic preferences.Noah Carl, the lead researcher, said he suspected the finding “largely reflects differences between social conservatives and social liberals”.“Leave voters were not much more economically rightwing than remain voters, but they were substantially more socially conservative,” he said.“Eric Kaufmann has shown that measures of socially conservative attitudes (eg support for the death penalty, opposition to immigration) are among the strongest predictors of voting leave in the referendum.”The research added to previous connections that have been suggested between progressive politics and admiring brutalist architecture, against conservative respect for more traditional building types.As for why the link is so strong, the researchers have a number of theories but no firm answers. They suggested “some remain supporters may have opted against the more realistic painting because, within their “habitus”, liking abstract art has positive connotations like cosmopolitanism, intellectual sophistication and open-mindedness”.Alternatively, the difference could be a reflection of the psychological underpinnings of the two groups, based on the “five-factor” model of psychological profiling. “Leave supporters exhibit relatively high conscientiousness,” the paper concluded, “which is the typical psychometric profile for a social conservative.”“Insofar as they score higher on conscientiousness, social conservatives may evaluate abstract paintings more negatively because they impute less skill or effort to their creators.”Carl argued the findings have more relevance than just for those trying to curate the best gallery exhibition for remain voters. “One lesson would be to accept that leave and remain voters’ preferences at least partly reflect their underlying psychological proclivities, and that these proclivities lead the two groups to hold different sets of values on average,” he said.“In other words, although it might seem obvious on reflection, it bears repeating that some political disagreements are not fundamentally resolvable because they arise (at least in part) from the fact that different people simply want different things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5de40adeec744f784ca74d7ba7b65cea0b8640d/0_66_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68a353acffbe34f9f6af25f6b7131871","title":"pmqs brexit theresa may jeremy corbyn question national audit office chief over brexit planning politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsPMQs - Snap verdict: At exactly this moment a week ago Theresa May was on her feet in Birmingham delivering a conference speech that promised, among other things, the end of austerity. It got a very good reception in the hall, and a fairly good reception from the commentariat generally. But it is increasingly likely that it will be added to the long list of political speeches that succeeded in the short term, but failed dismally in the long term, because this afternoon Jeremy Corbyn shredded it, and left it (metaphorically) in tatters on the floor of the Commons chamber. Repeatedly he challenged May to confirm that the government would end austerity, and repeatedly she was unable to say anything that implied that there is any substance to her breezy conference rhetoric. David Cameron was able to win a political argument with Labour over austerity by saying that spending was out of control, and that the books had to be balanced, but now that May has given up trying to defend austerity in principle, she was left with very little to say in response to the evidence Corbyn was able to produce about ongoing spending restraint. She fired out stats of her own quite forcefully, but they weren’t convincing. (Claims about “record spending” are always a bit bogus because inflation means actual spending is almost always going up it is real terms spending that counts. And “absolute poverty” is poverty base-lined against income in a particular year over time, it always goes down.) Corbyn did not produce a zinger that would have made this one of the all-time memorable PMQs, but thoughtful Tories should be worried. If there were to be a general election soon, this exchange would serve as a good dress rehearsal for how the austerity debate would pan out. And the Tories are losing.Corbyn says May should spend some time listening to teachers.May says there are £2.4bn of unpaid benefits available under the legacy welfare system left by Labour that will be paid under universal credit.She says austerity is being brought to an end. What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.Corbyn says the poorest household will lose £754 a year if these cuts go ahead. Eight years of painful austerity have taken place. Wages have been eroded. Yet billions were found for tax giveaways and for the super-rich. May said she was ending austerity. But unless the budget ends the cut, the claim that austerity is over will be seen as “a great big Conservative con”.May says wages are going up, and there are fewer people in absolute poverty. What about the £18bn in income tax cuts? She says 11m household will benefit from the energy cap. And freezing fuel duty has saved people £46bn. She says Labour’s plans would cost £1 trillion. Labour would take us back to square one, she says. Corbyn says the police are taking the government to court about police funding.In the last year the education secretary has been rebuked four times for making false claims about education funding. Can May confirm that austerity is over for all teachers, who will now all get the recommended pay rise.May says the police pay award is the highest consolidated awared for the police since 2010.School funding is at a record high, she says. She says she recognises the pressures schools are under. The government has improved schools partly through the academies and free schools programme. But Labour is opposed to that.Corbyn says the Tory leader of Northamptonshire council said they could not cope with the cuts. Will May end austerity as promised last week?May says there are more teachers in schools now. She says she recognises the hard work down by teachers.On Northamptonshire, she says an independent report said failures at the council were not due to lack of funding.Some £200bn was available to help councils deliver their services.And rural services have had more, she says.She says the government had to take tough decisions. That was because of the state of the public finances left by Labour.People have made sacrifices. They need to know that was worth it. She says better times are ahead - under a Conservative government.Jeremy Corbyn starts by expressing his sympathies to the victims of the Indonesian earthquake.He says there are 5,000 fewer mental health nurses than in 2010. Last week May said austerity was over. When will it be over for the mental health services?May starts by backing what Corbyn said about the earthquake, and summarising what the DEC has raised.This government has raised the esteem of mental health services. It is putting record levels of resources in, she says. But she says more needs to be done. That is what the government is announcing today. She says she has appointed a minister for suicide prevention for the first time.Corbyn says it was a Labour amendment to the Health and Social Care Act that put parity of esteem in legislation. The government opposed that. He says the income of mental health trusts is lower than it was five years ago. People are being sent 300 miles away from home.Police numbers have been cut. When will austerity be over for the police?May says the government will be doing more on mental health. She will be £394m per week into the NHS.On the police, she says the government has made £460m more available for policing this year. Why did Labour oppose that?May says the government is committed to supporting the performing arts.The SNP’s Joanna Cherry asks about an EU constituent who has failed the habitual residency test. Even the DWP could not understand the letter, she says. Is this the fate of all EU nationals staying in the UK?May says the government has guaranteed the rights of EU nationals in the UK after Brexit.Theresa May starts by saying that after PMQs she will be watching a parade of 120 soldiers into parliament. This is an opporunity to thank them for their work, she says.Back to Brussels for a moment.Here is the batting order.Sir Amyas Morse is head of the National Audit Office, the Whitehall spending watchdog. As he told the committee this morning, he is a chartered accountant by profession, and that may help to explain why he has never been seen as the first person you would turn to in Westminster for hyperbole or headline-grabbing quotes. NAO reports are famously dull (and need quite a lot of de-coding for the stories to emerge).So, in the circumstances, what he said this morning was actually rather strong.Here are the key points.There is so much concentrated risk. When you think about it, if you pardon my saying it, you wouldn’t start from here. You have a lot of things going forward in very short timescales. Generally speaking, the civil service is putting a terrific effort behind this. But because of the large number of unresolved risks that will be there at March, some of of those are bound to come to reality. So rather than saying “it will fall apart like a chocolate orange”, what will happen is there will be points of failure.When asked where the problems would occur, he cited the border as a place where difficulties were likely.Is is a good thing that there hasn’t been clearer communication with business? I think it’s been driven by a desire to not cause uncertainty and concern in the business community, but I think it has carried a heavy price with it. I think government could have told stakeholders more and I think it would have been positive if they had. But I understand their argument for not doing it, which is that it would only cause ferment in the business community. But I think they underestimate the capability and the maturity of the business community quite a bit. They are actually very good at running their businesses. And if you don’t give them a chance to plan ahead and to solve the problem, you are putting them in a very difficult position. And I think many businesses are going to find themselves in a relatively difficult position. If you listen to the department, I think there is more risk than they are saying on some of their timelines and projects.It has been visible to me that members of the civil service have been using our reports to find out what’s happening on Brexit. I don’t think that’s a good state of affairs.I am thrilled that I have a wider readership but I actually think, if you are asking people to be behind what you are doing, you need to make sure that they do know what the overall enterprise is and feel really well informed. I think it was all taken a bit too far frankly.The Labour MP Seema Malhotra, who asked Morse about this, said his answer was “extraordinarily worrying”.This morning Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, briefed European commissioners on the Brexit talks. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, he told them the EU wanted “decisive progress” before the EU summit scheduled for Thursday next week.Martin Selmayr, the commission’s most senior official, then told the meeting the EU had to prepare “for all outcomes”, the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge reports."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba65a113edd29eb0720b3487c2edbfc9c9cc748c/0_157_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ba571700789441bc891bf7d7bf4eddd","title":"young offender institutions segregation report childrens commissioner england","story":"Children’s commissioner also finds length of time people are locked up alone has doubledYoung offenders are increasingly being locked up on their own, a children’s rights watchdog has found, highlighting one case where a child was kept in segregation for 100 days.The solitary confinement of children is widely agreed to be bad for their mental health, the commissioner said.In one incident, a child was kept in segregation for 100 days due to self-isolation at YOI Feltham in west London, while all YOIs reported at least one instance of segregation of 75 days or more.The commissioner, Anne Longfield, raised concerns that if a child chose to self-isolate for long periods, the reasons for this should be investigated and support put in place.“Children tell me that segregation can bring on feelings of stress, apathy, anxiety, anger, depression and hopelessness,” she said. “I want to see more transparency and accountability around the use of segregation in the youth justice system. “It is extremely worrying that the practice is increasing at the same time as the number of young people in the youth justice estate has fallen. There is widespread agreement that keeping children in solitary confinement is bad for their mental health.”Longfield will present the research to the joint committee on human rights on Wednesday. The findings include accounts of children spending up to 23 and a half hours in a cell each day, which the report said would appear to contravene articles 37 and 40 of the UN convention on the rights of the child.One child from a YOI, interviewed as part of the report, told of feeling “upset and anger” at being put into isolation. “I’ve gone from being out of my pad all day to being isolated, well locked up really, for three days straight, so there was a lot of emotions going through my head. I didn’t really know what was going on,” they said.“I was up and down, I was angry smashing up my pad and stuff like that. I ended up tying something round my neck and dropped to the ground.”The report said gang involvement, prison staffing levels and shortages of NHS mental health beds may be driving the increased use of segregation.Across all YOIs over a six-month period, there were 306 separate episodes of segregation lasting more than a week, which compared with the overall number of episodes of segregation is “very high”, the report said.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “The safety and welfare of young people in our care is our priority. That is why there are strict safeguards on segregation, which is only used as a last resort when someone is likely to cause harm to themselves or others.“We are recruiting more staff and investing in enhanced support units for the most vulnerable offenders, so young people have the support they need to turn away from crime and contribute to society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a346f97d05e9264ab562a72045522d0d2fe6454/0_129_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=369b4aabac6fc04d19681eab828d2ac9","title":"young people drinking alcohol study england","story":"Research shows greater proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds shunning alcohol entirelyA large proportion of young people in England are shunning alcohol completely, a study has suggested.Researchers said abstaining from alcohol was becoming “more mainstream” among people aged 16 to 24 after the analysis showed a rise in the proportion of non-drinkers.University College London’s researchers said the norms around drinking appeared to be changing.But the increased rates of non-drinking were not observed among smokers, ethnic minorities and those with poor mental health, according to the study, which analysed data on almost 10,000 young people.Dr Linda Ng Fat, the lead author of the study, said: “Increases in non-drinking among young people were found across a broad range of groups, including those living in northern or southern regions of England, among the white population, those in full-time education, in employment and across all social classes and healthier groups.“That the increase in non-drinking was found across many different groups suggests that non-drinking may becoming more mainstream among young people, which could be caused by cultural factors.“The increase in young people who choose not to drink alcohol suggests that this behaviour maybe becoming more acceptable, whereas risky behaviours such as binge drinking may be becoming less normalised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e866ddd4bf465a6e386aea29504d2a63525503f/340_204_3876_2326/master/3876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=770e6beb53a10862cb4ee6b6068fce5e","title":"w series formula 1 women drivers promote","story":"A new motorsport series is set to be launched in an attempt to find female Formula 1 stars.W Series will start in 2019 and has been backed by major names in F1, including 13-times grand prix winner David Coulthard and Red Bull’s chief technical officer Adrian Newey.It will offer a prize fund of $1.5m and free entry for 18-20 competitors, who will be selected purely on merit following tests and appraisals.

However, an all-female series is essential in order to force greater female participation.”The last woman to start an F1 grand prix was Italy’s Lella Lombardi in 1976, but Coulthard says female drivers can compete with their male counterparts. He told the Daily Mail: “In order to be a successful racing driver, you have to be skilled, determined, competitive, brave and physically fit, but you don’t have to possess the kind of super-powerful strength levels that some sports require. You also don’t have to be a man.“That’s why we at W Series firmly believe that female and male racing drivers can compete with one another on equal terms given the same opportunity. At the moment, however, women racing drivers tend to reach a glass ceiling at around the GP3Formula 3 level on their learning curve, often as a result of a lack of funding rather than a lack of talent.“That’s why an all-new all-female single-seater motor racing series is required – W Series – to establish a competitive and constructive motorsport habitat in which our drivers will be able to equip themselves with the necessary skill-set eventually to move on up to existing high-level mainstream racing series and compete with the best male drivers on equal terms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6719918d6f8e56bae821b04ff7436788cd96b474/110_26_3633_2181/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=159e8e5372acbd7fa119c9102c1b578e","title":"sri lanka v england first odi live","story":"There’s no rain in Dubai, where Australia are up against it against Pakistan …Australia are 87-0 chasing an ever-so-slightly-unlikely 462 to win.The rain is apparently easing now in Dambulla, which is nice. We’ve just seen some footage of the rain. The word “torrential” springs to mind.There was an hour’s buffer built into today’s schedule but with the rain now heavy we’re looking at a reduced-overs game. How reduced, of course, remains to be seen …“After returning from our Sri Lankan honeymoon earlier this month (where we stopped by Dambulla and Kandy – and lovely it was too), lots of the locals were puzzled as to why these locations were selected for the series’, what with both areas in the midst  start of their respective ‘rainy seasons’,” writes Mark Lewis. “Any ideas? Or is this just to shoehorn in the 237 pre-Christmas-days-play…”Have to admit, I’m none-the-wiser. There’s rain forecast every day for the next week at least.Here’s our man in DambullaGreetings John ... bit of a frustrating scene here at the ground. Curiously it’s only the lightest whisp of rain but looking into the distance it is properly filled in with the odd flash of lightning and you suspect it is about to properly rod it down. There is a giant golden statue of Buddha on a far away hillock that is starting to disappear. First time in Sri Lanka for me and so first time watching the army of groundstaff pull off their cover-the-entire-ground trick during play. Tarps, weighed down by car tyres, right up to and over the boundary ropes in a matter of minutes. Sensational. More good news: the covers are covering the entire field of play. More bad news: the rain is now coming down. The good news is that it’s not raining – the bad news is that that’s because it’s not actually started yet. We’re in precautionary mode. In the meantime, why not get Jos Buttler’s thoughts on the series in video format:Gah! The rain that has been looming ominously seems to have arrived, and the wind has picked up ferociously.15th over: England 92-2 (Morgan 14, Root 25) Dananjaya keeps Root honest by losing the bells and whistles and keeping things simple with some accurate, nagging off-breaks. Just two from the over.14th over: England 90-2 (Morgan 13, Root 24) The busy Dananjaya makes a fine ing stop on the leg-side boundary as Root flicks Malinga away once more, though this is a much better over from the veteran … until the last, which is a leggish short one that Root pulls effortlessly away for four. 13th over: England 83-2 (Morgan 13, Root 18) Dananjaya continues and Root muscles him through the covers off the back foot for four. Fine shot. Morgan looks slightly less comfortable against the spinner and gets squared up by one, though just as I type that he slog-sweeps the last emphatically over square leg for six, so what do I know.12th over: England 70-2 (Morgan 6, Root 12) There’s a bit of cloud coming in and there’s a good chance of rain in the next hour or so. The forecast is fine after that, though the dry weather so far today has been the exception rather than the norm in Dambulla at the moment.Root clips the returning Malinga away for four to backward square leg and from the last the bowler strays on to Morgan’s pads and gets tickled to fine leg for more more. Eleven from the over. 11th over: England 59-2 (Morgan 1, Root 6) Dananjaya opens his selection box of deliveries again and Morgan gets off the mark with a drive down to long on for a single. 10th over: England 55-2 (Morgan 0, Root 5) “Boom, boom, boom. Lemme hear you say wayoh! Wayoh!” Are cricket grounds the only place you’ll hear the Outhere Brothers in 2018? Probably. Hopefully. Sri Lanka have their collective tail up and Pradeep has his head in his hands after finding’s Root’s edge and seeing the ball fly through the vacant second slip area. Four of the flakiest for Root. There’s a huge appeal from the last as Root is cut in two by one that moves back in to the right-hander. There’s a noise as it flies through to the keeper but it’s off the thigh pad.9th over: England 51-2 (Morgan 0, Root 1) So 49-0 becomes 51-2. Dananjaya beats Morgan’s outside edge with a beauty from round the wicket.Oh, this is pretty horrible from Jason Roy. He has a big heave at the spinner and can only sky the ball straight to mid on. 8th over: England 49-1 (Roy 23, Root 0) An important breakthrough for Sri Lanka then. There was a brief pause while the third umpire checked that the catch had carried through to Dickwalla but Bairstow has gone.Pradeep continues and we get the first moment of concern for England, bowler and keeper appealing vociferously as Roy misses a pull that zips over his shoulder. And from the last ball of the over Sri Lanka do have the breakthrough, Bairstow feathering a drive through to the keeper.7th over: England 48-0 (Roy 22, Bairstow 25) Time for spin! Akila Dananjaya comes into the attack. He’s nominally an off-spinner but tends to mix it up. Bairstow misses out on a full-toss from an attempted leg-break and it’s a tidy over until the final two balls, one of which Bairstow carts over the midwicket boundary for six, the other he lashes square on the off side for four.6th over: England 37-0 (Roy 21, Bairstow 15) Chandimal resists the urge to turn to spin and has Pradeep continuing. That’s music to Roy’s ears – he crunches a full delivery over mid on for four. A fuss-free seven from the over.5th over: England 30-0 (Roy 15, Bairstow 14) Yuck – Malinga drops horribly short again, so the ball sits up and screams “HIT ME!” Bairstow does just that and picks up four more through backward point.“A dirty turner is either a wood lathe operator who doesn’t wash,” begins John Starbuck, “or the second male lead in Pirates of the Caribbean, who also doesn’t wash but then they all get dunked in the sea so often they probably don’t feel the need.” I’m going to assume that makes sense to somebody – the POTC films aren’t exactly my specialist subject.4th over: England 25-0 (Roy 14, Bairstow 10) This is already looking a touch ominous for Sri Lanka. Threat level: zero. And England’s opening pair look very much in the groove. Bairstow hits the cover fielder with a thumping drive but steers the next ball wide of the man and through for four. A couple of balls later he repeats the trick: four more! 3rd over: England 17-0 (Roy 14, Bairstow 2) Roy does well to dig out a Malinga slow-yorker and celebrates next ball by heaving a short one to midwicket for four. And next up there’s another – Malinga aiming for another yorker and instead providing a leg-side full toss that Roy flicks, slightly awkwardly, away for four more.2nd over: England 7-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 1) Pradeep, returning to the Sri Lanka ODI side for the first time since January, steams in from the other end. Bairstow is watchful, then gets off the mark with a slightly squirty push down to third man for a single. Roy gets up on his tippy toes to push through the covers for a couple more from the last.“I hope this turns out to be a keenly contested match,” writes Don Mihsill. “Sri Lanka seem to be rotating the same set of ‘promising’ batsmen, neither giving them continuity (of opportunities) nor discarding them. Speaking of dirty turners, what all would qualify as one? A defence witness who has turned? A country road with a wide bend? A public official called Turner with a reputation for underhand dealings? Oh the possibilities.”1st over: England 4-0 (Roy 4, Bairstow 0) It’s 2007 all over again, as Lasith Malinga opens the bowling for Sri Lanka. He’s arrow-straight with his first few deliveries and Roy responds in kind. The fourth, though, drifts towards the leg side and Roy thunks confidently wide of mid on for four. Out come the players – play is imminent.Russell Arnold says the pitch is a good one and isn’t a “dirty turner”, which is a tremendous phrase that I’m going to bring into my regular rotation.Here’s Ali once more: “Another point of mild interest is that England will play in their T20 solar red to avoid a kit clash. As Henry Moeran of the BBC quipped, no word yet on what happens for the Test series ...”On Sky Sports, Mike Atherton says Liam Plunkett isn’t in the squad because “he’s getting married for the first three games”. Crikey, how long are the speeches going to be?Two mystery spinners for Sri Lanka, three spin options for England.Sri Lanka’s Dinesh Chandimal wins the toss – he decides to have a bowl first.Here’s our man in Dambulla, Ali Martin:Morning John and chums, from Dambulla, where Olly Stone, the headline writers’ dream, is indeed making his England debut and Liam Dawson also plays. Mark Wood and the Currans miss out, plus Bangladesh-bound Alex Hales. Hot day here with fluffy white clouds and blue sky in patches. We saw a huge infestation of flying insects when England trained last night, but the floodlights on the nets were much lower than those in the ground so hopefully the little critters don’t affect the fielding side too much later on. In other wildlife news, I had a family of monkeys - Toque Macaques to be precise - on my balcony this morning. I’m no expert but from the body language, they too seemed baffled by Sri Lanka’s omission of Angelo Mathews....We’re still awaiting the toss and teams but Olly Stone is expected to make his England debut:It’s four weeks and one day since the final day’s play of the final Test of the English cricketing summer.

If you’re anything like me you’ll still be digesting the poignant farewells, still be ruminating on the beautiful paeans to another season been and gone, still be picturing the shadows lengthening across a yellowing square in the last of the low summer sun.Well, SNAP OUT OF IT! This isn’t the 1920s, you know. You can’t spend three months on a paddle steamer going halfway round the world to play another three months’ worth of knockabout warmups against a series of village sides. This is MODERN SPORT.

The worryingly out-of-sorts Sri Lanka provide the opposition, with the hosts eager to arrest a miserable run of form that culminated with an Asia Cup exit at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

It pricks the mind and boasts a strong performance from Siân Brooke as another of Hare’s complex female protagonists. Yet it is a less-than-perfect dramatic structure and has one puzzling piece of characterisation.The action starts in 2018 with a press conference about whether Pauline Gibson, an MP who has become the angel of the NHS, intends to stand for the Labour leadership. The play then zigzags back in time to trace Pauline’s progress. We see her as a medical student in 1997 in Newcastle, where her fraught relationship with her lover, Jack Gould, is on the verge of collapse. Hare follows the ergent paths these two characters take over the years.Pauline works as a doctor, campaigns to save a Corby hospital and, having become a national icon, stands for parliament as an independent before finally joining the Labour party. Meanwhile, Jack follows the orthodox path of the machine politician to the point where he finds himself potentially pitted against Pauline as a future Labour leader. The question is: will she run?It’s a scenario that gives Hare freedom to explore any number of ideas, in particular, whether the virtuous integrity of the single-issue militant can survive the messy compromises of party politics. In a tremendous penultimate scene between Pauline and Jack, Hare hits several bullseyes, such as Labour’s greater interest in process than in votes and its tribal reluctance to elect a female leader. As always with Hare, the play is packed with sharp and witty apercus and highly quotable lines.But, in tracing all the forces that motivate Pauline, the play sometimes loses impetus. A scene with her mother, who has become an alcoholic after years of violent abuse, helps explain Pauline’s anger but doesn’t do much to drive the action forwards.Similarly a scene detailing the difficulties faced by the aspirational daughter of an immigrant family seems to be there to make a number of points. I was also left asking why Pauline can’t entirely shake off her long-ago love for Jack: a man who categorises feminism as stupid and lazy and who puts political ambition before emotional honesty.For all its faults, the play still fascinates and Neil Armfield’s lucid production gets a terrific performance from Brooke. I was strongly reminded of the character of Susan Traherne in Hare’s Plenty, in that Pauline is another idealist in an imperfect world Brooke captures perfectly her mix of fury over our worship of the false god of “efficiency” and her failings, such as the faint air of self-righteousness.Pauline is no saint, but rather, as Brooke shows, a woman who abandons the idea that left and right are dated concepts to learn that inequality can only be fought through party allegiance. Alex Hassell lends the dubious Jack a smooth charisma and there is good support from Joshua McGuire as Pauline’s loyal press agent and from Amaka Okafor as a Westminster staffer.Even if the play sometimes lacks momentum (as well as any reference to Momentum), it still shows Hare’s capacity to use theatre to take the moral temperature of the times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9273ce6561ab14269797239f082e174648e6a48c/0_0_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9127ef582b0e9a3745831ade268a6af7","title":"fixing the fells the campaign to save the paths of scafell pike","story":"Lake District repair team fear funds to protect route up England’s highest mountain will fall short as crowdfunding deadline looms At the busiest times of year, the stream of human traffic on the Brown Tongue path never ceases – not even at night.The route used by 100,000 people every year – as the most direct way to the top of Scafell Pike, England’s highest mountain – is one of the most heavily walked paths of its type in the world. But its popularity has come at a high price.Work to control erosion caused by the impact of countless feet on the path has been going on for 30 years and costs tens of thousands of pounds a year. It is the Forth Bridge of path repair: a job that is never finished.But as a crowdfunding campaign to raise vital funds for the next phase of work on the path enters its final phase (closing on 21 October), it is still some way short of its £17,000 target. Path repairers are stressing the importance of success for a campaign that would enable them to futureproof a large section in the middle of Brown Tongue for several decades.The crowdfunding effort forms part of a larger, year-long push to raise £100,000 for Scafell Pike as part of the Mend Our Mountains campaign, a UK-wide appeal being led by the British Mountaineering Council. It is one of 13 similar campaigns being run concurrently by Mend Our Mountains and supportive organisations across Britain. The aim is raise £1m for path repairs in a variety of locations, from Scotland to Sussex.The British Mountaineering Council’s Mend Our Mountains campaign is also supporting Fix the Fells’ ongoing work to stabilise erosion on the route as well as the campaign to raise the £17,000 required.Richard Fox, from Fix the Fells, leads the teams of specialist path repairers who do the arduous, all-weather work of protecting Brown Tongue and the Lake District mountains from the inadvertent damage caused by our feet. “Nowhere else in the world has the sort of pressure we have in the Lake District,” he says.“We are really grateful to Mend Our Mountains for the work it does in supporting us. It’s important that campaigns like this succeed. There is no government funding for Brown Tongue so we rely on fundraising to keep our work on it going.”Brown Tongue is the route favoured by participants in the Three Peaks Challenge (climbing the highest mountains of Scotland, England and Wales in 24 hours), which adds to pressure on the path. Most challengers tackle Scafell Pike in the dark, slogging up Brown Tongue as part of a procession of headtorches.Brown Tongue is one of the most serious examples of a problem often found on popular hills and mountains across Britain. Left alone, erosion scars can grow as wide as a motorway, wiping out vegetation, disturbing local habitats and hydrology, and even destroying terrain features such as mountain tarns.“If we stopped our overnight working, within five to 10 years we’d see huge scars of the sort that blighted the Lake District 30 years ago appear again,” says Fox.Fix the Fells uses a combination of landscaping and traditional techniques such as stone pitching but the work is costly. Usable local stone often has to be airlifted from nearby slopes and as Fox says: “Our path repairers have to be skilled craftspeople who can carry out high-quality, well-designed works that blend in with the landscape and last for the long term.”It costs about £500,000 a year to maintain all the mountain paths in the Lake District and Fix the Fells, as with similar organisations elsewhere, relies on fundraising to sustain its work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56de4847fd469df42b0b1ced06d8cd374d139733/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a0aa2a5f52ae0c7989482474d079b28","title":"hurricane michael florida panhandle","story":"Hurricane Michael has strengthened into a Category 4 storm as it continues to plow through the Gulf of Mexico towards a potentially catastrophic landfall along the Florida Panhandle, where 500,000 people have either been ordered or advised to evacuate.By midday on Wednesday it is expected to become one of the Panhandle’s worst hurricanes in memory, with heavy rainfall expected along the north-eastern Gulf Coast, a life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet (4 metres), and sustained winds climbing to 120mph (190kmh).“THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE to evacuate before conditions start deteriorating within the next few hours,” Florida governor Rick Scott tweeted early on Wednesday.More than 20 million people across five states, Florida, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas, were under a hurricane or tropical storm warning by Tuesday evening. Florida officials said roughly 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast had been urged or ordered to evacuate. Evacuations ned 22 counties from the Florida Panhandle into north central Florida. But fears lingered that some failed to heed the calls to get out of Michael’s way as the hard-charging storm began speeding north over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.The storm has claimed at least 13 lives during its northerly march through the western Caribbean and Central America.Donald Trump made a disaster declaration for Florida that allows the resources of the federal emergency management agency (Fema) to be deployed. Early reports of flooding from the Panhandle were received before nightfall.At 2am on Wednesday, the eye of Michael was about 180 miles (289km) south-southwest of Panama City, Florida. It was also about 170 miles (273km) south-west of Apalachicola, Florida. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles.Authorities upgraded the hurricane to a Category 4 status in the early hours of Wednesday morning. They said Category 4 storms were “extremely dangerous” and had the potential to devastate large areas and leave homes without power for weeks.Officials including Trump, Scott and Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor aiming to become governor in next month’s election, all urged citizens not to underestimate the storm.Speaking at an emergency management briefing on Tuesday morning, Scott, who declared a state of emergency in 35 of Florida’s 67 counties from the Panhandle to Tampa Bay, said the forecast “keeps getting more dangerous. This storm will be life-threatening and extremely dangerous.”At the White House, Trump told reporters the federal government was “very well-prepared”.In western Cuba, Michael triggered flash floods and mudslides in mountain areas. Disaster agencies in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported 13 deaths as roofs collapsed and residents were carried away by swollen rivers. Six people died in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Authorities were searching for a boy swept away by a river in Guatemala. Heavy rains swamped the region at the weekend after Michael formed off the coast of Honduras.Scott activated hundreds of national guard members and waived tolls to encourage evacuations. He also warned caregivers at north Florida hospitals and nursing homes to do all possible to assure the safety of the elderly and infirm. Following Hurricane Irma last year, 14 people died when a south Florida nursing home lost power and air conditioning.“If you’re responsible for a patient, you’re responsible for the patient. Take care of them,” Scott said.Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia county bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders would not be able to reach them while Michael hits the coast.“If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you’re now calling for help, there’s no one that can respond to help you,” Morgan said.In the small city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr said 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.No shelters will be open in Wakulla county, the sheriff’s office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with sustained winds below 111mph. With Michael’s winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.“This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,” the sheriff’s office said in the post.The entire neighboring state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration. Governor Kay Ivey said she feared widespread power outages and other problems would follow. Forecasters warned spinoff tornadoes would also be a threat.In Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for more than 90 counties, and in North and South Carolina areas affected by flooding in Hurricane Florence last month were bracing for a foot of more of additional rainfall.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/899645000b1eb466f88a68f20f38cfdff2968629/32_478_5894_3538/master/5894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=469b1a804b739d9763cd56af47f2617d","title":"guinea bissau refugee naturalisation scheme","story":"Those on the verge of becoming full citizens in Guinea-Bissau are beneficiaries of a policy that stands in contrast to that of many other countriesEduardo Marina was harvesting in the peanut fields with all the adults in his family when he smelled the smoke. Raising his head, he saw that Missira, his village in southern Senegal, was burning.Marina ran towards the fire. The children were still in the village, being babysat by his eldest daughter, Satou. Gathering them up, he and the whole family ran through the forest and over the border into Senegal’s tiny southern neighbour, Guinea-Bissau.That was in 1991. They have never been back to Missira. Ever since, they have lived with thousands of others in limbo in Guinea-Bissau, waiting for a nearly four-decade conflict to end.Now, they are on the verge of becoming full Guinean citizens, as beneficiaries of a sweeping policy that stands in stark contrast to many countries’ reluctance to take in those fleeing war, persecution and poverty.Seven thousand refugees will join Guinea-Bissau’s 1.8 million citizens, equivalent to the UK naturalising 256,000 refugees at a stroke.The government made the declaration last December and approved it in July. Since then the UN refugee agency has been working with a local contractor to produce and distribute ID cards, naturalisation and birth certificates for the refugees and their children, most of whom have never known any other home except the verdant, Creole-speaking, gumbe-playing country they grew up in.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“They were facing the risk of being stateless because of having no documents,” said Mamadou Lamine Diop, the UNHCR’s recently appointed chief of mission in Guinea-Bissau. “It can be a lesson to others: how Guinea-Bissau managed to get rid of its caseload.”When he arrived, Diop realised that a major obstacle to getting the refugees naturalised was the astronomical amount the government wanted in order to turn each one into a citizen – 900,000 CFA (£1,230) per person. Under his leadership, the UNHCR managed to negotiate down to 150,000 CFA.UNHCR is trying to raise this amount – $2m (£1.52m) in total – from donors. Without it the organisation cannot start processing ID cards. “Just imagine how much money we can save and redirect to other people in need,” Diop said.As well as the money, dysfunctional Guinea-Bissau hopes to reap a much-needed reputation boost with the policy. Before the villagers fled, armed rebels fighting for the independence of Senegal’s southern strip had been coming to Missira regularly, demanding animals and warning people to get out.When they arrived in Guinea-Bissau, Marina and his family headed straight for the village of Pelundo, where they had old family ties dating from colonialist days, when Guineans used to go and work in French peanut fields.They were a hungry, ragged group by the time they got there. “We only had the farming clothes we were standing up in,” said Marina, now a meticulous 73-year-old who became the village chronicler, keeping track of local fortunes in large notebooks. “We managed to take the children. That was all.”Nevertheless, he said, Pelundo welcomed them in. “The villagers here said we had complete equality,” he said. “They even gave us posts – I was the secretary of the village football club.” He gestured at Pelundo’s simple earthen streets and its veranda-ringed houses. “This was common land. If you had the money, you could build a house on it.”Marina is looking forward to being a citizen – he cannot imagine ever being able to return to Senegal. “I don’t dare go back,” he said. “The rebels come and go – you think it’s peaceful and suddenly they strike.”For Satou, his daughter, naturalisation is less about safety and more about identity. Now 39, she was babysitting at the age of 12 when the rebels came to burn down their village.“My ID is Senegalese, but now I’m Guinean,” she said, balancing a baby on her hip. “I’m from here. I wouldn’t want to go back. The villagers see us as locals now – in fact they always have done.”Their old village, Missira, is one of 64 that have been wiped off the Senegalese map. Scouts who have gone to look for it say the streets have become forest and the houses are completely gone. The only way you can tell it was once inhabited is by the clustered fruit trees that drop their mangoes on the forest floor, with no one there to eat them.With the Marinas now happily integrated in Pelundo, Missira will probably stay that way. But not all of the refugees in Guinea-Bissau feel the same. Some still long for home, decades after leaving – not every village has been as generous as Pelundo.In Tarero, as the families who fled expand, land is running out. “As you harvest your crops, the locals are sowing theirs right behind you,” said Lansana Tiara. “There is hospitality, but it’s limited.”Land rights are often a highly contentious issue for newly minted citizens, as in the case of Tanzania when it offered 200,000 Burundian refugees citizenship in 2015. Guinea-Bissau’s $270 per refugee includes a sum for integration, to which land is key, but it cannot solve all land-related problems.For many, the border between the two countries is a frustrating colonial relic, and the whereabouts of “home” is complicated.“In colonial times, my father was forced to work planting trees in Guinea-Bissau, so the whites could walk in the shade,” said Nfally Tiana, puffing on a pipe in his 1970s-style flowery robes. “He ran away to Senegal.

As global population expands, there are lessons to be learned At the end of a dusty road in the southern African hinterland sits a small concrete building with an orange door. It is a structure so modest and remote that it is hard to believe it could hold lessons for addressing one of the world’s biggest challenges.Outposts like these – offering family planning services, contraception, education – have helped bring about one of the world’s most remarkable demographic shifts. In a continent where fertility rates are the highest in the world and populations are soaring, Botswana has a different story to tell.Fifty years ago, Botswanan women would have seven children on average. Now they have fewer than three. It’s one of the fastest falling fertility rates anywhere in the world – a dramatic decline that merits scrutiny.The world’s population is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and almost 10 billion by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa is set to grow faster than anywhere: there were 1 billion Africans in 2010, but that number will grow to 2.5 billion by 2050.Some have warned that this growth risks “driving civilisation over the edge”, a controversial view given that it is rich countries, not poor, that lead the way on consuming the world’s resources.But enabling women to control their fertility – a move that almost inevitably leads to them having fewer babies – is not just about a tussle over resources, or the environment: it brings enormous ramifications for women’s health, education and employment – with knock-on effects for society and the economy.So what did Botswana get right?In a ground floor office at the University of Botswana, in the country’s capital of Gaborone, Dr Chelsea Morroni considers the issue. “Everyone is always asking how did this happen?”An expert in international sexual and reproductive health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Morroni has lived in Botswana with her family for five years. As founder and director of the Botswana Sexual and Reproductive Health Initiative, she spends her days delving into issues around fertility and contraception.But Morroni says understanding Botswana’s dramatic fertility decline involves teasing apart a complex web of factors.“There’s been a huge amount of change in Botswana,” she says, pointing out that since Botswana became an independent country in 1966 the landscape developed quickly, with high levels of economic growth and development of both healthcare infrastructure and education infrastructure, enabling young women to become educated and have employment opportunities.“All of those things on the macro level are really important to fertility declines anywhere in the world,” says Morroni, whose work is part of the Botswana UPenn Partnership: a collaboration between the Botswana health ministry, the University of Botswana and the University of Pennsylvania.But the country made more direct strides, too. “Botswana also was very proactive in the early years in establishing a family planning programme, so in setting up a programme that was far-reaching in terms of its geographical reach, providing access to most people in the country to a range of contraceptive methods,” says Morroni.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theMaternal and child health and family planning services were integrated from the outset more than 40 years ago. A suite of contraceptives are now available through facilities ranging from the most rural health posts to urban hospitals. An NGO, the Botswana Family Welfare Association (Bofwa), works with the government to reach out to even the most rural of locations around the country to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services, particularly among young people.And there is another issue. “Botswana … has been very hard hit by HIV, one of the hardest hit countries in the world,” says Morroni. And as she points out, research suggests there is an association between HIV infection and reduced fertility, although how much of contribution that has made to the steep fertility decline is very difficult to say. “Luckily with the advent of universal access to antiretroviral therapy we are seeing a narrowing of the gap between fertility in HIV infected and uninfected people which is really, really a step in the right direction,” she says.All of which mean that women like Chyna are becoming statistically rarer. “I have seven children and all the time I was bearing these seven children, there was never a break in between eight years,” says the 30-year-old, sitting inside the Gasita room, the fabric around her hair bright with the colours of the Botswana flag.A single mother, Chyna found respite from multiple pregnancies through the work of Bofwa.“I eventually got to find out about the implant from Bofwa – I asked for help because the pregnancies were getting out of hand and, knowing myself, if it wasn’t for the implant I would still be pregnant now,” says Chyna, speaking through an interpreter.While the health post is government run, Bofwa makes a visit about once a quarter to Gasita and nine other settlements around Kanye, led by nurse and midwife Phenyo Ntoko. These outposts are replicated across rural Botswana, where women are increasingly keen to embrace contraception, including the implant which sits in the upper arm and lasts for years.Their priorities are as inidual as the women themselves. For some it is about preventing pregnancies at an early age, for others the main goal is to space children. Many women gathered at the health posts said they only want two, with many years between them to help them raise their first child well.Despite the complex range of factors behind the dramatic fertility decline, and the fact that different countries have different political histories and cultural and social influences that make comparisons difficult, Morroni believes other nations could take a leaf out of Botswana’s book.“From my perspective it is really about having the political will for the development and implementation of a high quality family planning programme with reach,” she says.A World Bank report on Botswana’s fertility revolution says myriad other factors contribute to a more measured approach to family planning: the education of girls, encouraging women to enter in the workforce, and reaching iniduals in their homes by means of visits by family welfare educators.Una Ngwenya, the chief executive of Bofwa, agrees that the family welfare educators were a key factor behind the fertility decline. But, she adds that national averages don’t tell the whole story.“Where I work, mothers still have six kids,” she says. “People tell you in Botswana you have an average of women having two kids – I ask you, where? I cannot see that.“We are one of the most unequal countries in the world – what happens here in the big villages and in the cities, does not necessarily happen in Lorolwane,” she adds, referring to a remote village beyond Gasita, as yet without electricity.A member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Bofwa receives core funding from the organisation, as well as some government funding and contraceptive commodities and antiretroviral drugs from Botswana’s Ministry of Health and Wellness. Other partners include the Positive Action for Children Fund from private firm ViiV Healthcare.But Bofwa has had to close at least two centres because of Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the controversial “global gag rule” which prevents US federal funds going to any group that performs or even provides information about abortions.Among the Bofwa services suspended are projects specifically engaging with populations, including sex workers and men who have sex with men, as well as another working with vulnerable children.“Ah, that was such a blow,” says Ngwenya with a sigh. “The impact of the gag rule was so much on the clients, but also on Bofwa’s reputation. It really impacted our work in a very negative manner.”Bofwa does not provide abortions, but it does counsel women who might be seeking one – which is legal under certain conditions in Botswana – and those who have had an abortion.“For me, it is rewarding to see Bofwa help one girl to terminate a pregnancy that came from incest,” says Ngwenya, adding that improving understanding of when abortion is currently legal is important. “We want the community to know their rights,” she says, noting that the team see cases of young teenagers becoming pregnant. “Our research tells us there is a lot of need here. What has happened to these kids? Could it be rape, could it be defilement?”Nonetheless, Ngwenya is sanguine. “Bofwa is a very resilient organisation, we have been here for 30 years and we will go on for a good while to come.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Video screengrab: Oireachtas.ie  A system for compensating people harmed in screening and immunisation programmes should be established, according to the author of the scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.Dr Gabriel Scally said such a mechanism would remove the need for people to enter into adversarial court proceedings.In the United Kingdom, the government compensates people affected by adverse outcomes in immunisation programmes, in recognition the overall benefit of such programmes outweighs any harms that might result, he pointed out.Dr Scally is appearing before the Oireachtas health committee for the first time since his report on the CervicalCheck controversy was published last month. The report dealt with the failure of the screening programme and doctors to tell women about a retrospective audit that showed smear tests were incorrectly interpreted, potentially preventing them from receiving earlier treatment. Of the group of 221 affected women, 18 have died.At the start of the meeting, members observed one minute’s silence for two of the women who died at the weekend, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and another, unnamed patient. Ms Mhic Mhathúna is being buried in Co Kildare today.Dr Scally said he was saddened by the deaths, adding they served as a timely reminder of how serious cervical cancer is and of the need to make the disease an increasingly rare event in the future.In any screening programme, there is a balance between benefit and disbenefit, he said. For example, breast-screening programmes can identify cancers early but may expose some women to a small amount of radiation.In a well-run programme, the benefits will outweigh the disbenefits, he said. A good cervical cancer screening programme should pick up 75 per cent of cancers.Apologising for the length of time it took to produce the report, Dr Scally said the delay was caused by the poor provision of information in response to queries he made. Information was still coming in from the health service within 10 days of him finalising the report.Dr Scally repeated his view a commission of inquiry into the CervicalCheck controversy was not required. He said his report had succeeded in dealing with a substantial number of issues in depth and that setting up a commission might delay the implementation of its recommendations and distract the system from getting on with what it needed to do now.Ultimately, however, he said it was a decision for the Oireachtas."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Decision is sought over documents to be provided for case in which businessman alleges he was defamed in RT\u0026Eacute broadcastGusts of 80km and potential coastal flooding are expected, says Met \u0026EacuteireannLate Salvadoran archbishop is to be canonised by Pope Francis on SundayRita O\u0026rsquoDriscoll from Bandon charged with murder of Timmy FoleyTorpedoes from German submarine caused the worst loss of life ever on the Irish SeaCervicalCheck inquiry author appears before the Oireachtas health committeePaschal Donohoe insists he focused on investment in domestic economyIMO says it is expecting Government to put forward serious proposalsGarda\u0026iacute trying to trace Drogheda teenager missing for weeksTimmy Foley died from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen in frenzied attackWhat has been done merely a \u0026lsquodrop in the ocean\u0026rsquo, says woman running serviceChrist Church in Buncrana shuts doors for time being as overall security to be reviewedNational Transport Authority has two more deliveries of buses in pipelineCouncillors say Link acquisition of building would be \u0026lsquodestruction\u0026rsquo of city lifeIncrease in fast-food outlets and building work disturbing nests adds to rodent problemFormer Northern secretaries argue better to spend \u0026pound150m on victims and survivorsResidents of low-dependency \u0026lsquocare homes\u0026rsquo in the southeast face an uncertain futureReview says nurses in GP practices should do routine procedures and triage patientsCharity cites credibility fears, and shame and doubt in dealing with garda\u0026iacute as main causes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3657163.1539090562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"council says summer brought city wide rat infestation to dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council says many of its complexes are located near to canalsrivers, the natural habitat of rodents.

The spending review said there was very little available evidence on the overall efficiency of Irish primary care and general practice in Ireland and more work in this area was necessary. However it argued that some clear examples could be identified of areas where the efficiency of Irish general practice could be improved. “Within the practice itself, there appears to be scope for efficiency improvements in terms of the time GPs spend not consulting patients and the time spent conducting consultations which do not necessarily require a medical practitioner (eg, certification).”“ Greater use of practice nurses for triage and routine activities as well as other practice support staff would appear to be a key part of a move in this direction and the effectiveness of this approach in turn depends on increased practice sizes. The most obvious and substantial areas where changes in general practice has the potential to increase value for money for Government expenditure is through its interaction with other forms of health expenditure including drug prescription and gatekeeping for the acute healthcare sector.”The review said that research published in 2018 estimated a potential 15.9 per cent reduction in GP costs if the proportionate use of nursing staff in general practice in Ireland was increased to the rate in Northern Ireland. It said the OECD had also supported the policy of increasing the use of practice nurses in GP practices The report said that greater efficiency could result in potential savings of €75 million-€100 million and that this money could be used to deliver further services.How will it effect you and your finances?

Photograph: Michael McHughPA Trembling with indignation, Nigel Dodds stabbed his finger towards the government benches as he purred with menace at Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. “He needs to understand that as far as we are concerned as the Democratic Unionist Party we will not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of customs or single market as we leave the European Union. We’ve been clear about that from Day One! It’s why we had the debacle in December. Let’s not repeat that mistake,” he said.The debacle he was referring to was Theresa May’s trip to Brussels on Monday, December 4th, last year, when she had to rush home without agreeing to a backstop after Arlene Foster called to object. The incident reinforced the DUP’s image at Westminster as brutally tough negotiators, a reputation summed up by the endlessly repeated quote from a party figure during the confidence-and-supply negotiations with May: “This is a battle of who blinks first, and we’ve cut off our eyelids”.The DUP’s missing eyelids didn’t stop May from making a commitment to a backstop later the same week without their approval. Sammy Wilson acknowledged as much on Tuesday when he said the backstop was\u0026nbsp“foolishly agreed last December”.Although Raab looked a little shaken after Dodds’s intervention, he offered no commitments about the scope of the backstop beyond the government’s established position that there should be no customs border in the Irish Sea.As British and EU officials remain in their week-long negotiating “tunnel” in Brussels, Britain has accepted that the backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU for the regulation of goods. The EU’s “de-dramatised” proposal would expand on existing checks on animals entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.Goods would be regulated in the market as they are now under the EU’s market surveillance regime, which is administered by national and local agencies and is mostly unobtrusive and subject to the principle of proportionality. The DUP has thickened its red line in recent days to include a rejection of such a regime, arguing that regulation in Northern Ireland could erge from the rest of the UK over time.Britain’s demand that the backstop should be time-limited is unacceptable to the EU, which is also sceptical about the idea of the whole of the UK remaining in a temporary customs union.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNegotiators on both sides believe that the key to resolving these disagreements lies in the relationship between the legally binding text of the withdrawal agreement and the non-binding political declaration about the future relationship. Each side wants its priorities to be enshrined in the withdrawal agreement but both acknowledge the role of the political declaration in providing a context for the legal text that could make it more politically palatable.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Luke SharrettBloombergHurricane Michael howled closer to Florida’s Gulf shore on Tuesday with 190kph winds and a potential storm surge of 4 metres, giving tens of thousands of people little time to get out or board up.Drawing energy from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the storm strengthened rapidly into a potentially devastating Category 3.Forecasters said it could be nearing a dangerous Category 4 by landfall, with further strengthening expected overnight.It was forecast to blow ashore around midday on Wednesday near Panama City Beach, along a lightly populated stretch of fishing villages and white-sand beaches.While Florence took five days between the time it turned into a hurricane and the moment it rolled into the Carolinas, Michael gave Florida what amounted to two days’ notice.It developed into a hurricane on Monday, and by Tuesday, more than 180,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders.Coastal residents rushed to board up their homes and stock up on bottled water and other supplies.Florida Governor Rick Scott warned it was a “monstrous hurricane”, and his Democratic opponent for the Senate, Bill Nelson, said a “wall of water” could cause destruction along the Florida Panhandle, the north-western part of the state.“Don’t think that you can ride this out if you’re in a low-lying area,” Mr Nelson said on CNN.Concerns have been raised over an apparent lack of urgency among some residents to evacuate.Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said: “I am not seeing the level of traffic on the roadways that I would expect when we’ve called for the evacuation of 75 per cent of this county.”Mandatory evacuation orders went into effect in Panama City Beach and other low-lying areas in the storm’s path. That included Pensacola Beach but not in Pensacola itself, a city of about 54,000.Forecasters said parts of the Panhandle and Florida’s marshy, lightly populated Big Bend area — the crook of Florida’s elbow — could see three to four metres of storm surge.About 30 kilometres in from the coast, in Tallahassee, the state capital, people rushed to fill their petrol tanks and grab supplies. Many petrol stations in Tallahassee had run out of fuel.Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, Florida’s Democratic nominee for governor, helped people fill sandbags.Several people were taken by van from coastal Wakulla County to Tallahassee’s Leon County to the north. Wakulla County’s shelters are not considered reliable against storms stronger than a Category 2.Michael could dump up to a foot of rain over some Panhandle communities before its remnants go back out to sea by way of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days.Forecasters said it could bring three to six inches of rain to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, triggering flash flooding in a corner of the country still recovering from Florence.While Florence wrung itself out for days and brought ruinous rains, fast-moving Michael is likely to be more about wind and storm surge.As the storm closed in on the US, it caused havoc in the Caribbean.In Cuba, it dropped more than 10 inches of rain in places, flooding fields, damaging roads, knocking out power and destroying some homes in the western province of Pinar del Rio. Cuban authorities said they evacuated about 400 people from low-lying areas.Disaster agencies in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported 13 deaths as roofs collapsed and residents were carried away by swollen rivers."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

The majority of these are in low-income countries where health care workers have poor access to testing and treatment facilities.The research team has come up with a system which enables doctors or other health workers to detect TB-specific antibodies in a patient’s sputum. The patient produces a sample of sputum - this is put onto a tiny biosensor device which produces a colour, depending on whether it is positive or negative for TB.Via a smartphone\u0027s camera the app then analyses the colour and delivers a diagnosis within seconds.TB incidence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South East AsiaAlamgir Hossain, director of the Anglia Ruskin IT Research Institute, said analysis of colour samples using the naked eye alone was notoriously difficult. “By using the phone’s camera to capture the sample, rather than manually using colour charts, it eliminates human error and avoids any subjectivity around interpretation.  It also means that positive and negative samples do not need to be distinguishable to the human eye or depend on perfect colour vision,” said Prof Hossain.“This system wouldn’t be used instead of seeing a physician but would be a first port of call.  If the app detects tuberculosis it would instruct the user to contact a medical professional,” he added.The scientists hope to eventually add in DNA sequencing to enable the diagnosis to be more robust, said Prof Hossain.“If you add in the DNA sequencing on top of the biosensor the overall framework for the diagnosis will be much better and doctors will be able to consider this as a primary diagnosis. Many remote areas have limited testing facilities so if you can develop a mobile system it will really help,” he said.As well as a smartphone the health worker needs to purchase a small biosensor which has been developed by Universiti Putra. No additional hardware is needed and the system works offline so can be used in areas without internet connection.\u0026#039A quintessential disease of poverty\u0026#039 | The push to free Papua New Guinea from TBProf Hossain believes that the final cost for the system - downloading the app and purchasing the biosensor - could be as little as £2 to £3, depending on funding and uptake.The scientists hope that the diagnostic test, developed with a £129,000 grant from the Newton Fund, will be ready to launch in two years.Prof Hossain is currently supervising three PhD students looking at the use of mobile apps to diagnose diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease.“Mobile apps are a growing market in the UK and they have a lot of potential for diagnosing disease,” he said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security  PMQs live: Theresa May faces grilling by MPs as Brexit pressure growsMallorca floods: Which parts are affected and should I cancel my trip?Grenfell survivor tells how he had to leave his dementia-suffering father behind after failing to pull him from flatNew suicide prevention minister previously made jokes about suicideBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for GCSE results Best independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Decorator admits spray paint attack on homeless man who later diedStrictly judge to speak out on cheat couple as Arlene Phillips backs BBC, saying public cannot be \u0026#39moral s\u0026#39Game of Thrones, season 7 episode 3, The Queen\u0026#39s Justice - recapFresh airline failures predicted following spike in oil pricesNo-deal Brexit could spell chaos for UK borders and \u0026#39there will be points of failure\u0026#39, warns Whitehall spending watchdogGame of Thrones: Stormborn, season 7 episode 2 review - an episode of moments to make us cry \u0026#39finally!\u0026#39Game of Thrones, season 7, episode 1: Dragonstone review - bloodiest show on TV can still shock and surprise An invisible crisis: developing countries remain ill-equipped to tackle mental healthWho is Jack Brooksbank, the wine merchant fiancé of Princess Eugenie?Terror group al-Shabaab says it executed \u0026#39British spy\u0026#39 with four others accused of spying for US and SomaliaBulgarian man arrested in Germany and charged with TV journalist\u0026#39s murderChristian bakers in \u0026#39gay cake\u0026#39 row did not discriminate against same-sex marriage activist, Supreme Court rules\u0026#39Headlock\u0026#39 murder may be linked to organised crime, police say, as they announce £10,000 rewardWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177288263_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpNzU8CJ-LEEGicl5_0K7GzT5LH4WfwMUwvtX2jlkEnk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britain afraid make stand against putins clownish cronies","story":"Despite its recent setbacks, the Russian intelligence agency remains a formidable and well-resourced adversaryVladimir Putin appears to be the only person on the planet who remains resolutely unamused by the clownish antics of Russia’s GRU.

The firm is expected to collect around £50m in fees for managing Carillion’s liquidation.The Big Four’s stranglehold over the audit market has sparked repeated calls for the giants to be broken up over fears that large companies have little choice but to appoint one of them. Critics say this has led to cosy relationships between companies and the accountants hired to check their books.Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC audit\u0026nbspalmost all of the FTSE 100 and the vast majority of the FTSE 250.The fifth largest accountancy firm, Grant Thornton, announced in April that\u0026nbspit would stop pitching for FTSE 350 audits because it repeatedly lost out on work to the Big Four.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?MPs blast Carillion bosses and accountants for part in firm\u0027s collapseWorld\u0027s \u0027big four\u0027 accounting firms face £10m fines for serious breachUK\u0027s big four accountancy firms accused of \u0027feasting\u0027 on CarillionMPs accuse Big Four accountancy firms of operating ‘oligopoly’CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie said: “If the many critics of the audit process are right, it is not just the companies which buy audits that lose out it is the millions of people dependent on savings, pension funds and other investments in those companies whose audits may be defective.“Sir John Kingman\u0027s independent review of the regulator is a big step in the right direction. And the CMA will now examine the market carefully to establish what contribution more effective competition could make to improving audit quality.”The CMA will focus on three main areas including choice and switching in the audit market. The regulator will also examine\u0026nbspthe risk that each of the Big Four is “too big to fail”, potentially threatening long-term competition.Another question the CMA\u0026nbspwill seek to answer is whether the fact that companies pick their own auditor results in a lack of incentive to produce challenging performance reviews.Some critics have suggested that shareholders - as the outsiders who rely on an audit to assess the health of a company - should have a role in choosing the auditor.CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: “High-quality audit work underpins a successful economy and benefits us all. Given the in-depth thinking already done by the CMA and the Competition Commission before it, we plan to move swiftly and to issue our provisional findings before Christmas.”The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, which has been calling for an inquiry, welcomed the CMA\u0027s announcement.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The relationship between the UK and the Netherlands has traditionally been close, and will remain so in the future, but the Dutch view Brexit as a ‘lose-lose’ operation, Mr Blok told reporters at a briefing in the Hague. However, he added: “There’s a famous saying by Johann Cruyff - ‘Every disadvantage has its advantage’. In the case of Brexit this means a number of companies are considering or have already decided to leave the UK, and of course we are in the race to welcome them.“The Dutch population is English speaking, open-minded, we have deep harbours, wide highways, and a very good airport at Schiphol. We are a very attractive location, and we are not shy to promote it.”Davis says Tories will lose election unless Brexit plan scrappedFears rat hair and maggots may appear in UK food after BrexitBoE warns of \u0027pressing\u0027 need to protect financial products from BrexitThis is how Europe\u0027s national borders could be redrawn after Brexit He noted that many financial firms have already made the decision to move “at least part of their operations” out of the UK to mainland Europe, because “they are insecure about the effects of Brexit”.“As long as there is not a Brexit agreement there can be nothing but insecurity and they are spreading the risks,” he said. “I understand Amsterdam will host quite a number of specialised training companies. Of course we welcome these companies but we would rather there was no Brexit - but it’s too late for that.”Mr Blok said he was more hopeful that an agreement could be reached following Theresa May’s speech at the recent Tory conference, but added: “A hard Brexit is still possible, the Netherlands is also preparing for a hard Brexit. Not because we hope for it but because we are not sure it won’t happen.“We are an extremely important trading partner (for the UK), with Rotterdam Harbour, the largest European harbour, facing the UK. There is very intensive trade, so we are preparing in a very practical way, engaging customs officers, engaging phyto-sanitary personnel, but also thinking about parking space at the ferry terminals in the Hook of Holland - because we have to.”In terms of the Netherlands’ approach to the Brexit negotiations, Mr Blok said: “We have no negative intentions whatsoever towards the British.”While ‘it was a UK decision to start the Brexit procedure’, the Dutch regret that decision but respect the referendum result. However, he said: “During negotiations we will act within one unified European combination, and that’s not because we want to ‘gang up’ on the UK, but because we are one trading bloc negotiating with a new trading bloc in the making, and trade negotiations within the EU are always done on behalf of the whole union.”Mr Blok’s comments come after King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands said he still regrets the UK’s vote for Brexit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The firm is expected to collect around £50m in fees for managing Carillion’s liquidation.The Big Four’s stranglehold over the audit market has sparked repeated calls for the giants to be broken up over fears that large companies have little choice but to appoint one of them. Critics say this has led to cosy relationships between companies and the accountants hired to check their books.Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC audit\u0026nbspalmost all of the FTSE 100 and the vast majority of the FTSE 250.The fifth largest accountancy firm, Grant Thornton, announced in April that\u0026nbspit would stop pitching for FTSE 350 audits because it repeatedly lost out on work to the Big Four.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?MPs blast Carillion bosses and accountants for part in firm\u0027s collapseWorld\u0027s \u0027big four\u0027 accounting firms face £10m fines for serious breachUK\u0027s big four accountancy firms accused of \u0027feasting\u0027 on CarillionMPs accuse Big Four accountancy firms of operating ‘oligopoly’CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie said: “If the many critics of the audit process are right, it is not just the companies which buy audits that lose out it is the millions of people dependent on savings, pension funds and other investments in those companies whose audits may be defective.“Sir John Kingman\u0027s independent review of the regulator is a big step in the right direction. And the CMA will now examine the market carefully to establish what contribution more effective competition could make to improving audit quality.”The CMA will focus on three main areas including choice and switching in the audit market. The regulator will also examine\u0026nbspthe risk that each of the Big Four is “too big to fail”, potentially threatening long-term competition.Another question the CMA\u0026nbspwill seek to answer is whether the fact that companies pick their own auditor results in a lack of incentive to produce challenging performance reviews.Some critics have suggested that shareholders - as the outsiders who rely on an audit to assess the health of a company - should have a role in choosing the auditor.CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: “High-quality audit work underpins a successful economy and benefits us all. Given the in-depth thinking already done by the CMA and the Competition Commission before it, we plan to move swiftly and to issue our provisional findings before Christmas.”The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, which has been calling for an inquiry, welcomed the CMA\u0027s announcement.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The relationship between the UK and the Netherlands has traditionally been close, and will remain so in the future, but the Dutch view Brexit as a ‘lose-lose’ operation, Mr Blok told reporters at a briefing in the Hague. However, he added: “There’s a famous saying by Johann Cruyff - ‘Every disadvantage has its advantage’. In the case of Brexit this means a number of companies are considering or have already decided to leave the UK, and of course we are in the race to welcome them.“The Dutch population is English speaking, open-minded, we have deep harbours, wide highways, and a very good airport at Schiphol.

Our forecast is for growth of 1.3 per cent, which would be the weakest annual expansion since the financial crisis.”The ONS reported that year-on-year, UK GDP growth slowed to 1.5 per cent in August, down from 1.7 per cent in July.In August itself the ONS estimates that manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent and that construction slipped back by 0.7 per cent.Separately, it reported that the goods trade deficit was larger than expected by City analysts at £11.2bn, up from £10.4bn in July.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our forecast is for growth of 1.3 per cent, which would be the weakest annual expansion since the financial crisis.”The ONS reported that year-on-year, UK GDP growth slowed to 1.5 per cent in August, down from 1.7 per cent in July.In August itself the ONS estimates that manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent and that construction slipped back by 0.7 per cent.Separately, it reported that the goods trade deficit was larger than expected by City analysts at £11.2bn, up from £10.4bn in July.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps?

It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That is certainly the case where me and Rupert Murdoch are concerned.I was a young, new journalist on The Sunday Times. I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

disarray’\u0026nbspas British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I’ve said before we’d not stand in the way of a second referendum, a so-called People’s Vote, I think the SNP\u0026nbspMPs would undoubtedly vote for it.”\u0026nbspShe went on to say that the party would want to talk to allies about how Scotland would avoid finding itself in a position where the outcome of a new referendum forced it to leave the EU, regardless of whether Scottish voters had backed such a move.It\u0026nbspcame after the Westminster leader of the\u0026nbspSNP, Ian Blackford, said Scotland must have the right to vote on independence for a second time should there be a similar renewed vote on Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Blackford said the country should not be forced into accepting the result of any second Brexit referendum should Scotland again vote to remain but the majority of the UK vote to leave.Nearly 52 per cent\u0026nbspof those voting in the UK cast their ballot to leave in the 2016 referendum, but all 32 voting areas in Scotland had a majority for remain.“That would be only right and proper. There has to be the right for Scotland to call a second referendum on independence.”A YouGov poll of the SNP’s members showed on Sunday\u0026nbspthat an overwhelming majority not only support a People’s Vote on the outcome of Brexit negotiations,\u0026nbspbut also want the party’s 35 MPs in Westminster to give their positive backing for such a proposal.The poll shows that the party’s grassroots would support staying in, rather than leaving the European Union, by a margin of 93 to 7 per cent, excluding “don’t knows”,\u0026nbspif they were given the chance.A spokeswoman\u0026nbspfor the People’s Vote campaign said: “There is growing support in every part of the UK to give voters the democratic opportunity to cancel Brexit, and the SNP and people of Scotland have a crucial role to play to cleaning up a mess that is not of their making.“On this crucial issue Nicola Sturgeon is showing she is a political leaders who listens to her voters – who back a People’s Vote by a margin of more than four to one – and also her party’s members who are shown by our poll today to support giving the public a final say by an even bigger margin.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Former Brexit secretary David Davis warned on Tuesday of dire consequences for Conservatives at the next general election if the government sticks to its current negotiating stance.Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May when she will fulfil promise to end austerity David Davis warns Tories could lose the next elections, unless Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan is droppedScrap universal credit or face chaos of poll tax riots, Gordon Brown warnsMay appoints first ever minister for suicide preventionKen Clarke, the Tory MP, asks about the meaningful vote in Parliament following any deal Theresa May returns from Brussels with.\u0026nbspThat majority can only be obtained if the PM retains the support of the pro-European backbenchers on the Tory-side and pro-European\u0027s on the Labour benches, he says.\u0026nbspClarke adds securing these numbers would allow her to ignore the right-wing nationalists in his own party.May told the\u0026nbspCommons: I\u0027ve been very clear that there are better times ahead for people, we will see debt falling and we will see support for our public services going up.Austerity is being brought to an end. What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.Mr Corbyn, in his final remarks, said: The Prime Minister declared she is ending austerity. But unless the Budget halts the cuts, increases funding to public services, gives our public servants a decent pay rise, then isn\u0027t the claim that austerity is over simply a great big Conservative con?Austerity is being brought to an end, May says. What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says eight years of painful austerity, public services slashed, and wages eroded, and all the while billions were found for tax give aways for big corporations.\u0026nbspUnless the Budget halts the cuts... then isn\u0027t the claim austerity is over, a great big Conservative con?, he asks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMay hits back, saying Labour\u0027s plans would cost one trillion pounds, and taking us back to square one.\u0026nbspHe asks again, if austerity is over for the police, why is the police federation taking the government to court.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe adds - in the last year - the education secretary has been rebuked four times by the statistics watchdog. He asks whether austerity is over for all teachers.\u0026nbspMay says in relation to schools, I might just remind him that school funding this year is at a record high. She adds that she recognises the pressures schools are under.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn goes back on austerity - He says the Conservative leader of Northamptonshire couldn\u0027t deal with the level of the cuts. He asks again, will the PM end austerity as she pledged to do so last week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYes, we have had to make tough decisions,  May says. The reason we had to do that was because of the state of the public finances\u0026nbspleft by the Labour government.

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi Crown Prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul\u0027s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\u0027s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi Special Forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the Crown Prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia\u0027s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the Crown Prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident., has put Washington in a tough spot. The Crown Prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110 billion in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It could become an important milestone, either imminently or in the future.                MERKEL ON THE BRINK: Approval rating for coalition partners PLUMMETSING economist Carsten Brzeski said: \u0026ldquoSince the start of the new government in March this year, German politics have been hijacked by the forthcoming regional elections in Bavaria.In a bid to defend its absolute majority in Bavaria, the CSU has been openly criticising Merkel, starting several inner-coalition conflicts which almost led to a collapse of the government.While the CSU tried to make the election a kind of referendum on Merkel\u0027s stance on refugees, the continuous nagging and trouble-seeking in Berlin, initiated by the CSU, has completely turned this around.\u0026ldquoAccording to the trend of latest opinion polls, the CSU\u0027s strategy to distance itself from Merkel in order to prevent a rise of the AfD in Bavaria seems to have been a double failure.Angela Merkel and CSU leader  Horst Seehofer (Image: )A poll published by German broadcaster ARD last week showed support for the CSU had fallen to 33 percent, down from a typical vote share of around 50 percent.The poll showed the Greens Party in second place, with 18 percent voter support, ahead of the Social Democrats - a coalition partner of the CDU and CSU in Berlin - with 11 percent and the far-right AfD with 10 percent.If the polls are accurate, the CSU could see its worst performance since 1950, when it received 27.4 percent of the vote.Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan said: The election will also set the tone for further CDU-CSU cooperation at the federal level and could put further pressure on Merkel herself.A test could come at the CDU party conference in December, when Merkel is likely to stand for re-election as leader of the CDU.\u0026ldquoAt this stage, it is unlikely any high-profile candidate would run against her, but this will be another test of her authority.(Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg)            "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000330120232-e1496990302528.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"arlene foster democratic unionist party dup leader brexit ireland border pro brexit","story":"Here is what you need to know about Arlene Foster - the woman who leads the Northern Irish party which holds the balance of power and who Theresa May is relying on to get her Brexit proposals through Parliament.Arlene Foster, , is the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party which is the the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly.With ten MPs it is the fth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.Mum-of-three Mrs Foster is a lawyer by profession but for the past  years she has been involved in politics.In , Mrs Foster was appointed as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and later appointed as the First Minister of Northern Ireland.She served as First Minister from January  until January , when Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned before his sudden death.Under Northern Ireland’s power-sharing agreement, the two offices are linked and neither can govern while the other is vacant.Mr McGuinness, who died in March , resigned in protest over the “cash for ash” scheme.It has been alleged that Ms Foster mishandled a flawed renewable energy scheme which overpaid businesses for using green heating systems, costing the public purse about £million.According to a LucidTalk’s Tracker poll, the DUP’s Arlene Foster is the least trustworthy and least likeable party leader in Northern Ireland.Among the survey’s more than , participants,  per cent rate her trustworthiness as very low or bad while  per cent regard her likeability with the same level of dissatisfaction.The Democratic Unionist Party DUP was founded in  by firebrand protestant minister Ian Paisley during the height of the sectarian conflict.Its support lies among Northern Irelands Protestants, particularly the working class , who have historically been staunch believers in Ulster remaining in the UK.The party is deeply conservative on social issues and opposes same-sex marriage as well abortion, which remains illegal in Northern IrelandAlthough initially opposed to power sharing, it has been a key force in the Peace Process that has helped end decades of misery and stre in Northern Ireland.Theresa Mays decision to hold a General Election in  backfired, leaving the Conservatives eight MPs short of an overall majority and a hung Parliament.The Tories the sought the DUPs - who won ten seats in the  General Election - to remain in power.It agreed to support a minority Tory government on a confidence and supply basis, rather than enter a formal coalition as the Conservatives did with the Lib Dems in .The DUP will back the government on key issues that would topple the governmentthey lost a vote in the Commons, such as the Budget.So when it comes to getting the Governments Brexit proposals through Parliament, their views cant be ignored.The DUP is staunchly pro-Brexit — the only major party in Northern Ireland to campaign for Leave.Mrs Foster wants a soft Brexit, one key reason being the spectre of a hard border going up between north and south.As well as interfering with trade it is feared it could disrupt the peace process.Images of checkpoints and watchtowers came to symbolise The Troubles.In December  Theresa May seemed on the brink of agreeing a deal with Brussels on the first stage of Brexit negotiations, allowing talks to move to trade and the future relationship.A leaked draft appeared to show the UK had vowed to ensure continued regulatory alignment with the EU so as not to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.While Mrs May was meeting EU Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker, the DUP made a statement that kiboshed what had seemed a done deal.Mrs Foster said Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK and she would not accept anything .The DUP had threatened to pull out of the confidence and supply dealTheresa May caved into demands from Ireland and the EU.Mrs Foster has once again threatened to block Theresa Mays Brexit dealshe makes concessions over the border issue.After talks with EU leaders in Brussels, she remained defiant on her red line demands that she wont accept a Brexit deal where Northern Ireland is treated any dferently to the rest of the country.  "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  -

They are everywhere!!A third also reported: Hundreds of #adybirds crawling all over the greenstone walls in Shaftesbury today.Harlequin ladybirds, scientic name Harmonia axyridis, are ladybirds that are not native to Britain.Experts have previously said the ladybirds reach Britain by hitching a lt on the warm southerly winds.The foreign creepy-crawlies are said to pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease, called Laboulbeniales fungal disease.They are sometimes called the “Halloween ladybird” in the US because of the time of the year they flock.But there are actually , dferent species of ladybirds across the globe, with  dfernet types in the UK.The Harlequin ladybird is one of the newest insects to the block, appearing in Britain in .The beetles were introduced into mainland Europe from Asia, with it hoped they would help to control plant pests.Thriving here, they have even outcompeted some native ladybird species - even known to eat other ladybird larvae.To recognise the Harlequin ladybird from other British species, there are some telltale signs including:- Harlequin ladybirds are generally large, measuring about -mm- Their wing colour can be pale yellow-orange, orange-red, red or black highly iable- The pattern on their backs generally have zero to  orange-red or black spots* According to the Harlequin Ladybird SurveyThe deluge normally comes around this time of year, with a woman filming the insects pelting her countryside home as they sought shelter.Margaret, who lives just outside of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, said the three-day pelting was like something out of Hitchcocks The Birds.Margaret said: I was lucky I noticed it was happening as they just came out of nowhere and started hitting the window and streaming in.It was a struggle to close the window as I didnt want to squash any of them and by then they were already all over the window frame.Its not the first time the loveliness of ladybirds have swarmed homes.Residents in the town of Lipova, in western Romania, were forced to seal up their homes after the beetles descended in .Locals said they were so many it was like a living carpet, and that they had to shovel them out."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000433197202.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jean claude juncker everything wrong with eu","story":"He is everything that’s wrong with the European project — and why it’s so vital that we leave.In his latest rant, he demanded “respect” and delivered a warning that “Press freedom has its limits”.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ‘average’ survival time would be a matter of days.Leave your house behind and head for isolation and make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and some sturdy hiking boots.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps – you’ll soon be losing phone signal when power grids go down.Dartnell, who is a professor of science communication at the University of Westminster, and wrote The Knowledge: How to Rebuild our World from Scratch, added: Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray are all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditionsWith regard to weapons I suggest relying on your own ingenuity and resourcefulness, fashioning what you need from metal pipes or nails.”The study of , Brits also found the average adult believes they could evade a zombie bite for just over nine weeks,  hours and  minutes.Even NOW TV’s The Walking Dead could double up as a survival tool, as  per cent said they would scour Zombie TV shows for tips on how to stay alive.Make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and hiking boots. You’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, and when you’re running away you don’t want to slip and break an ankle.Buy iodine tablets to pury water once the taps run dry. There’s no point in surviving a zombie attackyou’re just going to die from a waterborne disease.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps to find minor roads.  You’ll lose phone signal when power grids go down.A plastic bottle must become your new best friend. If it’s summer, disinfecting drinking water by simply leaving it in the sun for a day can become a regular part of your routine An unraveled tampon makes an ideal dressing to stop a wound bleeding, and it’s perfect kindling for starting a fire.A condom can hold over a gallon of water. Don’t let it rupture in your bag.Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray - all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditions.Once the refined fuels have disappeared, cars can actually be run using wood as fuel. The process is called ‘gasication’ and was common in WWII. Leave your house behind and head for isolation.Get out of the city. Not only will they have the highest concentrations of roamers, but urban areas simply won’t be habitable once technology disappears.Head into the countryside and find traditional buildings with fireplaces and wells. A seaside region near a large wood is your ideal new home, offering you access to a wide range of natural resources.Ideally, a secluded spot with high walls or fences will help keep the swarms of walkers out when you’re settling down more permanently.Stick together - youll never survive the apocalypse as a lone wolf. Theres safety in numbers, but be careful who you pick as friends.Send scouting parties to find other pockets of survivors, or rig-up a radio transmitter.In the early stages of a zombie attack you can scavenge food from abandoned supermarkets or distribution centres. Prioritise canned food that will keep for years.If you forget your tin opener grind the top of the can in flat circles pushing down onto a paving slab. You’ll quickly wear away the thin metal lip and get that lid off.The power grid is out: but don’t worry, you can stay connected. Scavenge a mobile generator from roadworks.When the diesel runs out, you will need renewables: scavenge solar  or small wind turbines.The best kind of rechargeable battery is a deep-cycle lead acid battery. Scavenge these from things like golf buggies. Surprisingly, a golf course is one of the most practical places to head for after an apocalypse.Always dig your DIY loos at least  meters away from your water source and downhill, for obvious reasons.Washing your hands. Soap can be made from scratch by soaking water through the ashes of burned seaweed to extract soda, and then reacting this with slaked limeto make caustic soda. Boil this with lard, or any other animal fat or plant oil, to make soap.If you injure yourself, attend to the wound immediately.

Visiting the European Parliament in Brussels, the U singer hailed the European institutions as both a brain ... working to improve the lives of Europeans and a loudly beating heart bringing them together.The Irish rocker and anti-poverty campaigner did not mention Brexit in his comments alongside the Parliaments president Antonio Tajani, but said that pro-European voices were needed at a time when people are questioning Europe.As an artist, I think I probably have a role to play in romancing the idea of Europe and seeing it as something warm-blooded, said Bono. Europe is a thought that needs to become a feeling and I am, as an artist, in service of that.  Describing himself as European as well as Irish, Bono suggested that Europe had lost out for the lack of the kind of positive artistic treatment given to America in movies and songs. If you think about the mythology of America and you think about Hollywood and how Hollywood perpetuated the idea of the American dream... when you think about artists involved in the project that is Europe, its not that many, he said.

Mr Tajani thanked the singer for his engagement in the European project, adding: If we want to protect our citizens we need the European umbrella. Its impossible to compete during globalisation as Italy, as France, as Ireland, as Germany, with China, Russia, India or the USA. We need to be united all together as friends with a common history, a common identity and common values - first of all, freedom. Bono was in Brussels for talks about improving the partnership between Europe and Africa, which he characterised as an incredible opportunity.

It may only be  days to Brexit, but keep calm and carry on - the governments got it all under control. Including, erm, hiring experts on CIVIL EMERGENCY to deal with leaving the EU. Thats right - the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentis recruiting three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job title is the extremely catchy: G Resilience Advisers: EU Exit Readiness and Response Support to Local Preparedness. And the job description warns any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  The jobs are nine-month posts to support the departments Brexit preparations. That means they will end in June , although reassuringly there is the possibility of extension or permanency. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain group, said: The government are making preparations for a disaster of their own making. The governments dogmatic approach is leading us towards disaster and rather than avoiding it they are preparing for the carnage. This is why we need to stop Brexit democratically with a people’s vote.  A MHCLG spokesman said: “It is in everyone’s interests to secure a good deal for both sides and we think that is by far and away the highest probability, but we have a duty to plan for the alternative. “We continue to work closely with local areas, and meet representatives regularly. Government is doing the sensible thing and taking precautions as we plan for all scenarios.” It came as the government was forced to deny rat hair and maggots will be allowed in food in a no deal Brexit.  Business Insider reported US producers can include up to  insect fragments in a g jar of peanut butter  rodent hairs in a g paprika packet or  milligrams of rat or mouse excrement per pound of ginger. That has led to fears a blanket EU restriction on such contamination could be swept away. But Trade Secretary Liam Fox insisted: Scare stories such as this are baseless and untrue. Repeating them will not make them less so. Reports also emerged today that Whitehall is drawing up plans for a mass slaughter of sheep in a worst case No Deal Brexit. The Times reported it was an extreme contingency scenario in case ports are suddenly blocked while animals are mid-transit.

The Prime Minister had feared defeat after Tory rebels warned  members of her own party were prepared to vote against her in Parliament.If Labour votes against the deal too - which Jeremy Corbyn has said is likely - that could defeat it and send the government and Brexit into a chaotic spiral.Mr Corbyn has argued this situation would trigger the fall of the government - and a new general eleciton. But today it is being reported that a large number of Labour MPs, many in Leave-backing seats, are still uneasy about voting the deal down.  That is because of fears Mrs May could simply use a defeat to push ahead with a No Deal Brexit - the hardest possible outcome of all. If  Labour MPs back the deal, that could give Mrs May enough cover in Parliament to pass the crunch vote and survive as Prime Minister. One Labour MP told The Times: We are getting into very dangerous territory on no-deal.We will own it as much as Jacob Rees-Moggwe ultimately vote it down.Most people’s instinct is to be a loyalist but I think about this all the time. It’s bloody dficult. I’ve never broken a whip, but we’re getting to that point.  The reports come despite Labour MPs furiously rejecting Mrs Mays public appeal for unity around a moderate Brexit on the weekend.According to The Times, rebels will say the Brexit motion passed at Labour’s conference in Liverpool last month commited the party to avoiding no deal.“People can say we’ve had a go. We’ve tried to force an election and so on, one MP told the newspaper. But there is not a majority in the House of Commons when push comes to shove for a no-deal Brexit. It comes as EU and UK negotiators try to trash out a deal behind closed doors in a frantic final week of talks before next weeks European Council Summit. Theresa May will fly to Brussels next Wednesday in a bid to secure both a orce deal - the Withdrawal Agreement - and a political declaration on future trade.  Any deal will then come to a vote in Parliament, likely in mid-November. Downing Street drew a line in the sand this week by warning that declaration must be precise. Otherwise, Tory Brexiteers - who are fuming at the prospect of an imminent compromise - will mass against the deal. They are already furious that Mrs May is waiting until the last moment to reveal an alternative to her Chequers plan for customs and Northern Ireland - which the EU branded unworkable. Reports today suggest she will only put the new plan to the Cabinet at its next regular meeting next Tuesday - one day before she flies out.

Call a halt to this experiment - cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity - that is pushing child poverty among millions of hard-working British families to record levels. From next July when three million more families begin to be herded on to Universal Credit, our country will face the kind of chaos we have not seen since the days of the hated Poll Tax. With the convulsions of Brexit in March and the Universal Credit four months later we face a summer of ision and despair. From July each family on tax credits today will have to submit a wholly new form for Universal Credit – a policy Ministers have been warned will risk a breakdown in the system. Instead the Government should order a review into what is going wrong – and give emergency help to those families now in despair because of benefit cuts. With child poverty rising inexorably from three million in  to four million now and to more than five million by , October  should bring a Budget for children. And to halt the rising epidemic, Child Benefit should be raised and child tax credits should be improved - as the one way, alongside a decent living wage, that we can get low-paid families out of poverty.  Today’s poverty explodes the myth that children are in poverty because their parents are work-shy and indolent. Two thirds of the children in poverty have a parent in work - but earning too little to lt them out of poverty. In fact, nearly half - % - of households are in poverty where there is one breadwinner only in work and no other adult working. The majority of the rest who are in poverty have disability in the family. Savage Cuts are pushing them on to the breadline. And after freezing Child Benefit and children’s tax credits for years Universal Credit is taking pound-billion out of the social security budget as it is introduced. Almost .-million working families will, according to the Resolution Foundation, stand to lose an average of pound a week.  For poor people the safety net is becoming not the welfare state - it is instead becoming food banks and charities. We have seen what has happened in the Highlands where Universal Credit was first introduced. The UK Government has been asked to reimburse the local authority for the big increase in council rent arrears. Right now, in my own home area food banks are running out of food as requests for help double as a result of Universal Credit. Charities struggle to cope when giros which used to run out a few days before the next one now run out after a few days into the last one. Having served  years in public le I am now seeing poverty and hardship that I never thought I would witness and that I honestly thought we had escaped from for ever decades ago. Recently I have visited families that don’t have a cooker - and that means no hot food for the children. I have seen over the summer, when schools were out, girls and boys going for a whole day without a square meal – with charities struggling to improvise breakfast clubs and lunch clubs. I have met parents who, no matter how many hours they work, cannot put enough food on the table for their children after they’ve paid the rent the heating and for other basic essentials. The fact is that there is now more child poverty than under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. The income ide between rich and poor is bigger than in living memory. SIGN THE PETITION  Theresa May says her mission is to address burning injustice. Well the greatest burning injustice of all time is children going to school ill-clad and hungry. It is the poverty of the innocent – of children far too young to know they are not to blame. But the Government have lit the torch of this burning injustice and they have fanned the flames, with their pound-billion of cuts. Ato poll tax style chaos in a summer of discontent lies ahead...more rent arrears, more dependence on food banks and endless real-le stories of the infirm driven into desolation. As one of the architects of tax credits I remind people It was dficult enough to introduce tax credits even when we were spending billions more. But to impose universal credit and to force three million to reapply for their benefits next year when on top of a child benefits freeze they’re spending pound-billion less is chaotic, cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity.  So I am calling today for the Government to abandon the  national roll out of Universal Credit and end this harsh, harmful and hated experiment. We need an urgent review on the lines suggested by the Child Poverty Action Group to be instigated and we must hear the voices of those who know what it’s like to have help cut short I join iniduals and organisations who have called for a rethink including The Archbishop of Canterbury, The Church of Scotland, The Mayor of London, Disabled Against The Cuts, The Mayor of Liverpool, Mind, The Trussell Trust, Unison, Unite and Citizens Advice Bureau as well as the Child Poverty Action Group and most disabled charities. The review should look closely at three options: redesign Universal Credit to make it fit for purpose axing it in favour of reverting to the old systemUC is unfixable or introduce a brand new system altogether. And many good people have plenty of ideas about how this could be done Yes, right now, the issue of Brexit - our exit from Europe - is critical to our country. But millions of our fellow citizens are facing an equally big nightmare - anxious and insecure because they have no exit from poverty.

Canal boat enthusiast Michael Grainger and his we were still shaking days after their encounter with the creatures. The couple, from Colchester, were on holiday and sailing on the River Thames in Oxfordshire when they claim they saw the animals last Thursday morning. Huge black panther-like beasts have been sighted in Oxfordshire for decades and theyre thought to be breeding in the countryside. The legend of the Beast of Burford came after one was sighted opposite the Masons Arms pub in Burford Road, Brize Norton, in . It led to the nearby Cotswold Wildle Park offering a reward for its capture but it was never found. A photograph of the panther still adorns the wall of the pub. Describing the terrying sight for the first time today, Michael, , said the two creatures were lolling in a field beside the river.  There was one sitting on its hind legs in the field when another came out of the woods and started nuzzling it, Michael said. They were both jet black and bigger than a Labrador. I got my binoculars and watched them before they wandered off into the trees. I have good eyesight and they were no more than  metres away. I know what I saw - it was unmistakable. The couple spend their summers on a narrowboat and were sailing on the Thames at Culham Lock, Oxfordshire when they saw the two panthers. Michael said Weve never seen anything like it in the  years weve spent on the water. Further sightings of the panther been reported across west and north Oxfordshire but the beasts have rarely been seen as far south as Culham before. Its increased fears that they are expanding their range and breeding in new areas. Michael said he phoned Thames Valley Police and was interviewed by wildle experts in Wallingford. He said there were a large number of dog walkers in the area and he wanted to warn others of the potential of encountering dangerous wild animals.  Danny Bamping, who runs the British Big Cats Society which keeps track of sightings, said it was extremely rare to see two big cats together. He said the sighting was likely to be of a melanistic jaguar or leopard. They were released into the wild after keeping them as pets was made illegal in . He added: If there were two together it was either a couple who are breeding or a mother with her cubs. It is only a big catit has the capacity to roar -not, it is either a domestic cat or a hybrid. The lespan for these animals is about  years so were likely to be seeing the third or fourth generation. In April  a mum-of-two was nearly knocked down a black panther which strolled across the road in front of her car in north Oxfordshire. Lisa Londons terrying encounter with what she swears was a jungle puma happened on the main road through the village of Upper Arncott. Mrs London, , said she was driving from her home in Bicester to Oxford and had just passed through Upper Arncott, not far from Burford, at about .am when the beast, nearly ft tall, appeared. As I came out of the residential bit there were no other cars on the road, she said. You go down a country road and what I saw was maybe  yards in front of me - it essentially strolled across the road from the right to the left then leapt into the bushes. It looked like a black panther - it was shiny black and there was no way it was a dog or a deer or a domestic cat, it was too big. Mrs London estimated the creature was a metre tall and a metre-and-a-half long. It was jet black, and you just dont expect to see that on any other animal. It wasnt scary - it was beautul.  Mrs London had never even heard of the fabled Beast of Burford and it wasnt until she got home and told her husband about her close encounter that he remembered hearing similar stories. The pair went to Google and brought up newspaper stories about previous sightings of the legendary creature. Oxford resident Steve Archibald, who runs the website bigcatsightings, said at the time in April  it was not the first time he had heard reports of sightings in the Bicester area. But he had not heard of one for several years. A few months earlier he had received a call from Thames Valley Police to say a farmer near Chipping Norton reported he was in his tractor when he saw a big black cat running across his field with a muntjac deer in its mouth. Over the past ten years he has received something like  calls of Oxfordshire sightings in total. He said There definitely, definitely are big cats in Oxfordshire, but they are the most elusive animals on the planet. People who live with them in America might see paw prints and droppings but go their whole lives without seeing one. In Oxfordshire there is so much open space and woodland where they could hide. Theories behind how wild populations get established include escapes from sanctuaries or intentional releases by exotic animal owners, he said. Since  Thames Valley Police has been called to at least ten big cat sightings around Oxfordshire and neighbouring Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. In April , Connor Consyrag posted on social media I heard a story, a few months back, about several muntjac being found dead in the branches of trees. Panthers are known to kill their prey such as small deer and drag the carcases into the branches of trees to eat at their leisure. A spokesman from the British Big Cat Society said the UK has plenty of ideal countryside which is good hunting ground for panthers, cougars, leopards and even lions and tigers because there is lots of woodland for them to hide in and leap out on their prey. Escapees from private collections and small zoos are now living wild and have started families, he said. The only big black cat that would be seen in Britain was a melanistic leopard, commonly called a panther. The melanistic gene that makes the animal go black seems to be common when cats inter-breed. We know we have several dferent species so it is possible that the big black cats seen out there could be hybrid, so unique to science. Its not like believing in the Loch Ness monster. There is absolutely no doubt that they are out there. The most credible reports are from farmers, and those guys know their stuff. We have also had policemen reporting sightings to us. For every report, there are going to be others who dont report it. Many zoologists think Britain has a large wild population of big cats which have been breeding and forming colonies in remote areas of countryside since the late s. Thats when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act forced owners to get rid of exotic pets and they dumped them. The beasts have always been dismissed as the stuff of rural legend,creatures of fantasy, but a Natural England team declared these mysterious creatures do indeed exist. Their report - dubbed the X Files - revealed that of the -plus sightings since ,  were classed as big cats. In some cases, people said they had seen the creature itself, on other occasions they reported finding farm or wild animals which had been attacked or killed and partly-eaten. Natural England took it so seriously it launched several investigations over the last few years, involving site visits by experts and the drafting in of specialist vets to examine injuries.

But hours later the RAF airmans mother separately vowed to keep searching for her son who went missing on September  .Police said yesterday they believe Corrie fell asleep after climbing into a recycling bin and was crushed to death by a bin lorry before being transported to a landfill site  miles away in Milton, Cambridgeshire.Suffolk Police recently attended a meeting with Bfa, who confirmed the bin that was picked up from outside Greggs in the Horseshoe area of Bury St Edmunds weighed kg - much higher than bin collection weights from the same place normally.

Nicola said people had contacted her with information relating to the McDonalds man which she passed onto the police.  She wrote on Facebook: I do not know how long ago the police decided this person was no longer of interest and they dont want them identied. I do believe they have had no interest for over a year.

Mum-of-two Lucy Gosling went to Oriental Touch in Torquay, Devon, with family and friends when they discovered that the chicken they were eating from the buffet was pink inside.The -year-old said she felt sick to her stomach when she made the grim discovery, DevonLive reported .As my partner went to tuck into the chicken from the buffet he said at the time that it didnt taste right and when he opened it up, it was pink inside, she said.  I then went up to get a chicken ball for my son and as I was cutting it up for him I was disgusted to find that it was raw and bloody inside. We then cut open all of the chicken we had on our plates only to discover it was all uncooked. I was absolutely horried. Lucy said she and her family often enjoy a meal out at Oriental Touch and have never had any problems before. She added: We have been going there for more than eight years and we have never experienced anything like this before, I still cant believe that something like this has happened. I will never go there ever again. When we realised the chicken wasnt cooked we notied the manager straight away and he then went to check on the rest of the chicken at the buffet and he agreed that the chicken wasnt cooked properly. At first we thought he had removed all of the uncooked chicken so about half an hour later I went back up as they had brought fresh food out and when I cut it open, it was pink again inside. We tried calling the manager over again but he just completely ignored us, so my boyfriend went up to the bar and told them again and they still didnt remove the chicken.  I think the reason I am so angry about it, is because I have young children and there were more than  other people dining in the restaurant at the time and it seemed like the manager didnt care. Lucy described the whole incident as a complete nightmare and vows to never step foot in the restaurant again. She said: The manager admitted that the chicken was uncooked but he didnt seem to care. I am absolutely appalled that there was no customer service at all. Myself, my partner and my friends have all been extremely ill as a result of this and I just dont want them to think they can get away with doing something like this. Jason, the manager of Oriental Touch said: The customer who came in to our buffet restaurant on a Sunday afternoon while eating over an hour found a piece of chicken that was not fully cooked. The whole batch of chicken was immediately removed from the food court. We do apologise for the unfortunate incident that has happen. This have never happen before however in future we will be extra cautious. We do hold a hygiene rating of four star.

Known simply as P to her foot soldiers - she also built a huge walk-in wardrobe with dressing room stuffed with the latest high end fashion items including pairs of Jimmy Choo shoes, and clothing by Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood and Alexander Wang. She also wore a range of luxury jewellery including a Franck Muller watch worth pound, had Bang and Olufsen TVs littered around her six-bedroom property where she hosted VIP champagne and canape parties complete with a red carpet and guest list.

She employed her partner as her right hand woman and recruited another female friend to run day-to-day sales operations. She hired a designer to create the website. She purchased the machinery to mix the drugs at her HQ and even trained her staff in how to use it. But her crime empire crumbled after reveller Grant Wooldridge, , of Newbury died in July  after taking drugs ordered from the website whilst attending a music festival in Bath. He had mixed it with four other hallucinogenic and stimulant chemicals and told his girlfriend he was invincible before collapsing with seizures and cardiac arrest. Police eventually raided Whites home in May  during  swoops in which  people were arrested. They also closed down a number of websites linked to the racket. Inquiries revealed the chemicals were sourced in the Far East and mixed in the UK - with customers getting free t-shirts for sales.

When she saw the photos, Helen vowed never again to be a fat bridesmaid and slimmed down to an incredible size , now weighing just  stone.  It was horrendously embarrassing for me, watching my best friend get married and feeling like the fat bridesmaid, Helen said. “I stood out like a sore thumb in all the pictures, and when I actually saw the images taken I cried and cried.” Despite previously shting eight stone in  thanks to diet and exercise, Helen relapsed after meeting her husband, Matt and having two children. Admitting that she squeezed into size  clothes at her biggest, she recalled: “Matt was working in Manchester when we met, so I would stay over a lot and we’d go out for dinners, have drinks and le became really comfortable. “I’d lost the weight before by cutting out the rubbish and exercising every day, but I gave all that up when I met Matt and we fell in love.” Skipping breakfast, Helen would snack on crisps, before having a cheese and ham sandwich with a chocolate bar for pudding at lunch and a double portioned pasta meal, slathered in creamy tomato sauce for dinner.

She said: “I looked dferent to everyone  and really stood out. Another bridesmaid was pregnant at the time and I actually looked bigger than she did. “The dress wasn’t the same as everyone ’s because of the alterations and I felt larger than I ever had. “I made Matt delete all the photos he took of me and cried my eyes out.” Vowing to change, it took Helen seven months to summon the courage to contact the weight loss company, Cambridge Weight Plan. “My mum suggested I gave it a go, as they offer one to-one support and create a personalised plan,” she said.  “I couldn’t face going to slimming classes and being with lots of people I didn’t know.” In her first two weeks, Helen lost lb by eating and drinking only the Cambridge Weight Plan products, before slowly incorporating exercise into her regime, too. Now,  months on, she has even become a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant and has never felt better. “I’ve got a split-picture on my phone background - one photo is of me now and one is me at my largest.

A gesture would undoubtedly please William and Harry. “She might choose a hymn which Diana was fond of such as I Vow To Thee My Country which was sung at Diana’s wedding and funeral.” The Princess of Wales had always said the hymn had been a favourite since her schooldays.  Should the hymn be played, it would follow a whole host of tributes Prince Harry paid to his beloved mother at his own wedding in May. Her favourite flower, forget-me-nots, were touchingly included in Meghans bouquet. Another favourite, white roses, were also used in the arrangements. Dianas sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, was invited to give a reading - making her the only relative to speak during the ceremony. Harry and Meghan also decided to include the hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Dianas funeral.It was also played at Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding in .  When Meghan changed into her evening gown, a flash of blue on her finger gave away she was wearing one of Harrys mothers rings - with a stunning emerald-cut aquamarine stone. Princess Eugenie, , is set to marry in the same place as Meghan and Harry, tying the knot with her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.

This heartbreakingly beautul picture was captured on September , when Jessica was supposed to marry the man of her dreams, Kendall Murphy. The couple tragically never got the chance to wed after firefighter Kendall, , was hit and killed by an alleged drunk driver in November last year. But on what should have been their big day,  months after the tragedy, Jessica bravely wore her bridal gown and marked the date herself.  With her hair and makeup done, the courageous bride was pictured holding a bouquet of flowers as she paid an emotional visit to Kendalls headstone. She tearfully knelt beside the grave, with her head resting on her hands, before being joined by other loved ones, who knelt down beside her. “I wanted to be where he was at,” Jessica said. The bride, who made broken look beautul and strong look invincible, also honoured her beloved fianceacute in other ways on their wedding day. In powerful images, taken by Loving Le Photography in Indiana, US, she smiles beside Kendalls firefighter gear and gazes at a picture of him.  She also embraces loved ones, and later releases lanterns into the sky. And in one particularly striking shot from the day, she can be seen looking down at Kendalls boots, with his image photoshopped next to her. The late firefighter had worn the boots every day. Taking to Facebook the following morning, Jessica said her wedding day was special, even though I didn’t get to marry the man of my dreams. She wrote: I can’t say thank you to everyone enough for this entire week! I feel beyond spoiled and loved. This week wasn’t the outcome I wanted, but everyone made me feel especially loved.  I especially want to thank my sister for being my rock throughout everything, through the tears and the late night talks I couldn’t have done this without you. Thank you everyone for making my wedding day special even though I didn’t get to marry the man of my dreams. The wedding pictures, shared on Loving Le Photographys Facebook page, also feature Kendalls young nieces and nephews. One of them he sadly never got the chance to meet, Global News reports. Both Jessicas maid of honour and her fianceacutes best man are thought to have given speeches during the very emotional day.  Kendall, a volunteer firefighter from Montgomery, Indiana, was responding to a crash on a rural road when he was killed on November , . Police said he was pronounced dead at the scene after another firefighter responding to the incident, Colby Blake, , struck him with his truck. Blake was said to be driving with a . per cent blood alcohol level. He was arrested and charged over the incident, according to local media. The case is yet to be set for trial.

Though its clear that some people are still unable to grasp just what it means.But one group of eight to nine-year-olds in the US are having no problem understanding what consent is, thanks to elementary school teacher Liz Kleinrock and the brilliant method she has come up with to educate youngsters.In a post on Instagram , Kleinrock, who works at Citizens of the World Charter School in Los Angeles, shared a look at just how she does it.The teacher and her students created a chart working through what it means to give consent, what consent sounds like and when you need to ask for consent in everyday le. She also covered the awkward grey areas surrounding consent such as whata person says no but theyre smiling and whatyou really want a hug but the other person doesnt. Kleinrock captioned the post: Everything about Kavanaugh in the news has been making me HEATED. So whenever I get frustrated about the state of our country, it inspires me to proactively teach my kids to DO BETTER.  Today was all about CONSENT. We even explored the grey areas, likesomeone says yes but their tone and body language really says no. Role playing is a great way to reinforce these skills, but they MUST be taught explicitly! Thousands of people have liked the photo and praised Liz for educating the children on such an important issue. One said: This is amazing and would love for this to be a school wide practice!

Now some people have discovered a clever trick that means you might never have to pick up the iron again. Apparentlyyou just pop a couple of ice cubes with the garms you want to wear in the dryer, they come out wrinkle free. Amazing.  All you need to do is put the clothes and cubes in on a hot setting for a few minutes. It basically turns your dryer into a clothes steamer and gets rid of creases that way - so it makes sense. But be warned, people online recommend that you do not overfill the dryer when using ice cubes to steam items. Just one or two pieces of clothing at once will get the best results - any more and it might not work.

Heartbreaking images show Benjamin Monare sitting forlornly with an oversize jacket draped over his shoulders by the motorist who found him. The lone crash survivor was suffering from severe dehydration and was so traumatised he could barely speak and couldn’t remember his name or age. His parents Alessandro, , and Belkis, , and brother Samuel, aged eight, were all found dead in the familys car, which was found in a ditch in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The family were ing home after celebrating Mrs Monare’s birthday.  It’s believed the bewildered youngster was initially trapped in the wreck but managed to break free and scaled the banks of the gully where the car had plummeted on Sunday morning. He wasnt found until Tuesday morning. Preliminary investigations suggest the car was hit side on and catapulted off the road by another vehicle that failed to stop.  Dense vegetation kept the accident hidden for two days from passing traffic on the BR- motorway. The child miraculously escaped the carnage with only cuts and bruises, surviving on his own in the dark and without food or water. Devastated family members have been comforting the boy as he comes to terms with being an orphan. The youngster told rescuers he remembered the car falling down but couldn’t recall anything after that except when he got out and climbed the mountain.  Emergency rescuers used drones to search after worried relatives reported the family missing when they failed tohome at the expected time. The car was last seen on motorway cameras passing a state police checkpoint just after am. It should have gone through a toll booth further down the route but never arrived. Highway police and fire crew checked ious points along the stretch where they believed the car had gone missing but without success. Relatives also joined the hunt on Monday, using two cars to retrace the family’s journey as they desperately looked for clues to their whereabouts. Rescuers were about to launch aerial searches on Tuesday when the child appeared at the side of the road.  The tragic family, from Campinas in Sao Paulo state, were ing from a four-day break at a hot springs resort in Goias where they had been celebrating Mrs Monare’s birthday when the accident happened around :am. Mr Monare, a Baptist minister, told friends they would be back in the afternoon to vote in Brazil’s general elections. He was also expected to give a sermon at pm. The schoolboy’s aunt, Berenice Landim, , told local media: “The family left Caldas Novas on Sunday around :am and they were expected home in the afternoon. We were constantly in touch but when they didn’tour calls we started to get worried. “We alerted the police and shared our concerns on social media pleading for help and for any sightings of their car.”  She said her nephew is still in a state of shock and doesn’t fully understand what has happened yet. Tearful church members joined devastated friends and relatives at the Vista Alegre Baptist Church, to pay tribute to the family who had been involved in the community for six years. The aunt said: “This is a painful time for us, but we have to trust in God because he is the only one who knows why this has happened. “We believe our lives are fleeting and Benjamin’s le was spared for a purpose. We can only pray that God gives us the strength to care for him and comforts us through this dficult time. Because losing our loved ones in this way is very hard.” The young survivor is being kept in Uberlandia Federal University Clinical Hospital and monitored following a series of tests and exams. Doctors said his health is stable. Traffic cops have launched an investigation into the cause of the accident.

The tumour can be either mature and benign or immature and cancerous. The boys was the former, which often contains tissue such as bone, muscle or hair. Dr Shen said: The human brain is delicate like tofu, even more so when its a childs. It was like picking bones out of a raw egg. It was a very complicated surgery. Everyone is aware that leukaemia is the most common cancer found in children, but what people dont know is that central nervous system tumours are the second-most frequent. Of central nervous system tumours, teratomas are uncommon and found only about  percent of the time. Mature teratomas make up about  percent of that figure.  Theyre very dficult to spot early on, but when discovered, the patient is often suffering from serious hydrocephalus.

Mum Susie Martin wanted to highlight International Babywearing Week while getting on with her job presenting the forecast. She started the segment with a little explanation, as her one-year-old son did a huge yawn before dropping off to sleep in his comfy seat. Ms Martin, who is director of operations at weather company Praedictix, said: It is International Babywearing Week, so I thought Id bring out my handy assistant. As she went on through the changing weather, her little boy snuggled in to his mothers neck as she happily carried on working.  Speaking later to Good Morning America, Ms Martin said: I wanted to promote this wonderful tool thats helped me as a mum and the bonding experience between mother and son. I suppose its a way for the baby to be comforted. It was nice for me personally because I could multitask while comforting my child.The footage was later shared on Facebook and received more than .million views and thousands of comments.Ms Martin said she wa happy to see the footage was shared so widely. It does make me feel like a mom that can be very capable of doing things. Thats just the message that I love about it and I would say as a working mom, its nice to be able to have this tool with me to help me do my job. Dr Jason Homme, assistant professor of pediatrics at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told ABC News the key, initial phase of parent-child bonding is during the first few weeks of le, but theres more connecting that occurs a little later in childhood, as with Martins son.  I think its reasonable to conclude that it can help with bonding for both for the parent and child, Homme told Good Morning America of baby-wearing. I think to promote it in this way is creative. Homme said mothers and fathers shouldnt consider it a lesser style of parenting to use a stroller, or any other dferent carrier. Im strongly pro-bonding and pro-mum...and mum getting it done at work, he added.*International Babywearing Week took place from October  to ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/SMac_Ric_Stef_Dog_Heroin_Dundee-11.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"dog owners urged to lend their pets in bid to lead dundee addicts on road to recovery","story":"Dog owners in Dundee are being asked to share their pets with the city’s drug addicts and rough sleepers in a bid to inspire more compassion from passers-by.Ric May and Stef Ollandini, both , believe man’s best friend could help bridge the gap between vulnerable people and the rest of society.For the past month Ric has been taking his own dog Wolfy, a white German shepherd Siberian husky cross, out on to the streets to meet homeless people.He even leaves Wolfy with some of the beggars for a couple of hours at a time, which he claims has an effect on how they are treated by other people.Ric said: “It might seem like a very simple thing, but the bottom line is when he sits with them it has an effect on loads of people who wouldn’t normally go near them.“It’s almost like Wolfy is an invitation for lots of animal lovers to come and get to know them and get to know people they wouldn’t normally speak to.”Ric said he has no reservations in leaving his beloved dog with heroin users.He said the drug problem was “systemic” in the city, but added: “If people could raise the level of compassion towards them, that would be the real answer.”Ric and Stef are now calling for other people to follow the example and spend more time getting to know the people they walk past every day.Stef said: “Wolfy is able to act as an antenna for people who would just walk past the vulnerable in another instance.“Instead they come down and talk to them. All are welcome. It’s not just people with dogs we need, its people who have compassion.”One woman who has benefited from having Wolfy sit with her is heroin addict Karen.Karen, , has been using the drug for  years and uses three times a day.She said she noticed an increase in the number of people speaking to her when she had Wolfy by her side.“It just makes a dference with the dog,” Karen said.“There are a lot more people who stop and speak to you.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/IMG_0451.jpg.jpg ","title":"dundee fans group writes to top officials over

for  years he was a team-mate of Paul Clarke – brother of their current boss Steve.The pair even appeared on the same sticker in an edition of the annual Panini football album.All that’s prompted the Dundee Supporters’ Association to write to SFA head of referees’ committee chairman Willie Young and their head of refereeing, John Fleming, to question the sense behind having McLean taking games involving Kilmarnock.“Several of our members have contacted me to express their concerns over this and we think it’s only right to pass them on to the authorities,” said DSA chairman Kenny Ross.“And I do think there is reason to question the validity of this appointment when the referee so clearly has family connections to Kilmarnock.“If nothing  it puts him in a dficult position when you get a decision like Saturday’s.“I know that Steven McLean’s brother Brian played for Dundee United, Ross County and a few other clubs and he was not allowed to take charge of games involving teams he was at.“You think the same common sense approach could have been applied to his dad’s old team.”The fans also pointed out should the Killie player who ed to win the kick, Jordan Jones, be handed a two-game ban, that in itself could damage Dundee.The games he would miss would be against St Mirren and Hamilton, the two sides immediately above the Dark Blues at the foot of the Premiership.SFA

Goals give them that added confidence and there is also that perception that strikers, and rightly so, should be more responsible for scoring.“I loved how Sam took the ball in, linked the play and he was between the posts at the right time.“His two goals were good finishes.“Those goals should do Sam no harm.”Prior to his double against St Mirren, Cosgrove’s only other senior competitive goal came in a - League Two defeat of Crewe for Carlisle in January this year.He netted in a - friendly draw with Championship West Brom at Pittodrie in July.When McInnes signed Cosgrove in the winter transfer window he admitted the striker was one for this season.However, he pitched him in for a debut against Celtic less than a month later. It was a nightmare first Reds appearances as Cosgrove was red carded after just eight minutes of the - loss for a challenge on Hoops skipper Scott Brown.However, McInnes was always confident the striker would come good and is adamant he had already proven his worth before scoring the brace against the Buddies.McInnes said: “In the games that Sam has started we have not lost in  minutes so he has been effective for us. Sam can bring us that bit of size and he should be very pleased with his two goals.”The dismissal of a sorry St Mirren side also marked debut Aberdeen goals for Pittodrie Youth Graduate Connor McLennan and on loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe.McLennan was given the nod for his first Dons start just hours before kick-off, the day after celebrating his th birthday.Unfortunately the teen was taken off in the second half having suffered a dislocated shoulder. It is hoped McLennan will be fit to be considered for selection for the Premiership game against Hearts at Tynecastle following the international break.McInnes said: “When you play St Mirren you have to have ball carriers in the side.“In our own half of the pitch Connor was asked to cover his width but in the final third come into those goalscoring areas.“Connor did that brilliantly. His goal was fantastic and he should be very pleased with his performance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/Bill-Runciman_resized.jpg ","title":"sponsored be smart with your lawn this autumn","story":"Don’t forget about your garden or lawn this autumn.

I have a little lightbox with ‘Ask Alec’ on it,” he adds, “sosomeone has a question – and it can be anything from how to pay a cheque in at the Post Office to how to set up internet banking – I can help.”Alec is one of nearly  community bankers appointed by the bank to help bring it even closer to the people it serves.Along with  mobile branches which travel between towns and villages, internet banking, the bank’s market leading app and, of course, its high street branches, the community bankers are a key component in ensuring customers have a wide range of options covering how and where they do their banking.And with many transactions now carried out online, Alec and his fellow community bankers are bringing a particularly personal touch, helping to steer customers – and even non-Royal Bank customers – through the modern banking landscape at one-to-one sessions in locations that are close to home for most people.As the community banker for Perth, Alec’s ‘beat’ covers some of Scotland’s most picturesque towns and villages. “I’m lucky, it is an absolutely stunning part of the country – and I get to travel around it,” says Alec.“Although I have a set pattern of places to be throughout the week, every day is dferent.

All have timetables and location maps which can be accessed online.As well as offering support and advice to customers, they can arrange a meeting with a specialist advisor, or provide a financial ‘health check’ to ensure customers are getting the most from their money.In many cases, they can provide a little extra help for customers who need a guiding hand through the new banking landscape or have worries over internet security.Although they are in public places, the community bankers ensure that conversations are discreet and private, enabling them to cover a wide range of issues.“I get a lot of enjoyment out of helping vulnerable customers who may be housebound or not as active,” says Alec. “I can help get them set up with dferent ways of doing their banking which means they can retain control of their own finances and, in turn, remain independent.“They can do their banking from their armchair and that’s something that brings a lot of comfort and peace of mind.”Being available to customers is key, adds Alec, who encourages his customers to call his mobile or drop him an emailthey can’t manage to his drop-in sessions. vw, px\"  “While online banking means so much can be done from home, people still want that personal touch when it comes to banking,” he adds.“I aim to reach as many customers as possible, whether by being out with the mobile banking vans, in the branches or on the ‘streets’ at drop-in clinics.”His role, he adds, is all part of a growing service which is designed to ensure Royal Bank customers have their banking needs covered – wherever they are.“When you go through all the options that are available to customers – mobile, online, telephone, Post Office, mobile branches and community bankers – you can find a suitable scenario for just about every customers’ needs,” he adds.Community bankers are just one of the many options available to Royal Bank of Scotland customers.

Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr seafront street cordoned following","story":"NewsAyr seafront street cordoned off following major police presenceIt is believed a man is attempting to jump off a roof on Queen Terrace in Ayr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsQueens Terrace\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young man threatened to jump -feet to the pavement in an astonishing roof-top stand-off in a street full of guest houses.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-group-welcomes-post-office-plans","story":"MEMBERS of Melrose community council have welcomed plans to move the townrsquos post office to Market Square.As previously reported, the Post Office hopes to relocate the branch to Masons of Melrose bookshop.The townrsquos postmaster, John Collins, was hoping to retire at the end of last year.But he was forced to put his leaving plans on hold after proposals to move the provision to Abbey Mill in Annay Road were abandoned ndash following objections from the local community.William Windram, chairman of Melrose and District Community Council said: ldquoIrsquom sure everyone will have now seen there are plans to move the post office to Masons of Melrose.ldquoI havenrsquot yet heard anyone say they think the move is a bad idea.

and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian. You have Ormiston which has doubled or trebled in size, yoursquore going to have all these houses on the south side, and theyrsquore all still going to go down Tranent High Street.

On top of that, most of the additional cases in Scotland are equal pay and we are right down the middle of that - rooting out discrimination.\"The rise in equal pay cases is particularly appropriate since it was equal pay in Dumfries  Galloway that the Supreme Court used as an example of how free access to justice for one worker seeking pay equality brings benefit for many thousands.\"The judges were right in their analysis back in  and this data shows how big landmark cases reverberate in workplaces across the entire country.\"When the fees were introduced in July , The Herald reported a drop in cases of almost  per cent year on year.This prompted claims from employment experts that thousands of workers, especially women, who had been unfairly sacked or discriminated against, were being denied access to justice.The current figures from the UK Government show a complete turnaround, with equal pay cases - including a large scale claim against Glasgow City Council - accounting for the bulk of the cases with an increase of  per cent.Unfair dismissal claims also increased by  per cent over the period, while sex discrimination claims went up by almost  per cent and disability discrimination claims almost doubled.Brian McLaughlin, an employment lawyer with Unionline Scotland, which represents members of the GMB and Communications Workers Union, said: \"This is a signicant increase which is obviously welcomed by Unionline Scotland and the GMB and CWU trade unions.\"These fees were a barrier to justice which created a signicant problem for unfairly treated employees for the best part of four years.\"This upsurge in cases shows that the fees were a clear denial of access to justice.\"Jim Stephenson, convener of the Law Society of Scotlandrsquos Access to Justice committee, added that the increase showed \"a very real need for an accessible, impartial system to resolve workplace disputes\".While David Martyn, an employment specialist with Thompsons solicitors, claimed that the fees proved to be a \"massive disincentive\" for workers.\"For someone who was only claiming say pound, and having to pay out pound in upfront fees, the risk to reward ratio really didnt make any economic sense,\" he said.He also claimed that the scrapping of the fees has had a \"signicant impact\" on the employment tribunal service in Scotland, which he described as \"stretched\".A total of  new judges have been appointed in Scotland to meet the increased demand for hearings, while several tribunal rooms at the main hearing centre in Glasgow, which were converted into office space while the fee regime was in place, have had to be reinstated.Mr Martyn said: \"The tribunal service is struggling to cope, it was almost inevitable when the fees were stopped. The staff are doing their very best but theyre certainly stretched.\"These concerns were echoed by employment specialist Stephen Miller, of Clyde  Co, who claimed the tribunal service \"has been overwhelmed by the numbers\".He added that the increase in claims would also result in businesses and organisations facing signicant costs in defending the actions."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-councils-invest-20m-to-modernise-library-service","story":"The Scottish Library and Information Councilsaid the investment showed the strong commitment of councils to public library services.Earlier this month, figures showed a dramatic increase in the number of libraries being shut - with  closed in the past two years alone.However, the latest figures show council investment has led to the building or refurbishment of  libraries since March last year.Additional funding has also been provided to modernise library services with the introduction of free public wi, D printing resources and a film education programme.Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, welcomed the investment - announced in Libraries Week.She said: ldquoThis week celebrates the vital role of our libraries in Scotland and the fantastic service provided by staff and volunteers.ldquoI welcome this yearrsquos focus on wellbeing, which fits in well with the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to promoting social wellbeing and tackling social isolation and inequality through increased access to library services.ldquoSince , we have invested more than pound million to help re-invigorate the role of public libraries, providing funds to support local and national activity.ldquoI encourage local communities throughout Scotland to continue to use and benefit from the wide range of services that our local libraries provide.Pamela Tulloch, chief executive of SLIC, said a national libraries strategy had provided a framework for the ldquotransformation of services in the st century.She said: ldquoIn some areas, this has led to some venue closures to make way for a more relevant and flexible model of delivery.ldquoHowever, local government has continued to invest in the estate, demonstrated by the signicant capital spend.ldquoPublic libraries have faced a challenging time in recent years amidst public spending cuts.ldquoHowever, they have shown tremendous resilience and are adapting services to meet the needs of modern users.The latest figures show there is still a strong commitment to public libraries from the public with premise and virtual visits increasing from .m to over m since .Earlier this month, there was concern that the service was under threat with figures showing  libraries have been closed in the past two years.Figures form SLIC showed said  libraries closed last year, up from  the previous year.Closures have remained in single figures for most of the previous decade.There are fears libraries are seen as a ldquosoft touch for councils looking to make cuts in a climate of falling budgets.The former Scots-based Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson hit out at the scale of the closures, saying libraries served a vital role as community centres.A spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland said: ldquoWe recognise that recent years have seen huge local authority budgetary cuts.ldquoThe fact the number of people using libraries has increased in the same period highlights their popularity, the changing ways people access services and the vital contribution they make to community cohesion, social and economic wellbeing, digital skills, literacy and more.ldquoWe urge local authorities to think very carefully and consult residents fully before closing any libraries."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-let-us-stand-together-against-the-scourge-of-toxic-masculinity","story":"Thatrsquos not to say no woman has ever committed a violent or sexual offence ndash an infinitesimally small proportion of women have ndash but to compare such offences by women to offences by men, is to weigh a gnat against a mammoth.Irsquom not even going to rehearse the lsquonot all menrsquo argument ndash that lsquonot all menrsquo are abusive or predatory. I detest those three malignant words ndash they are a great wall standing in the way of men confronting the problems of their sex. Those words prevent our betterment as men. When I hear the words lsquonot all menrsquo, I see an apologist for misogyny ndash an enabler who is part of the problem.Readers will be aware that over the last few days, Irsquove written about the experiences of my youngest daughter, Caitie, after a man tried to lure her into woods, exposed himself, and masturbated in front of her. Caitie, a university student, ran to her place of work, Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow, and rang the police. The offender had mental health problems and police would not interview him. As a result, he was never charged or prosecuted. To compound her anguish, the man stalked her at work. Experts in male offending fear my daughter remains at risk as long as he remains at large.My concerns over what is wrong with men do not simply stem from the crime committed against my child ndash though that has certainly crystallised the thinking of decades. The words lsquotoxic masculinityrsquo didnrsquot exist when I was a young man, but they express the curdled disgust Irsquove felt throughout most of my le at the behaviour of many of my sex.Since my teens, Irsquove lost count of the number of close women friends who have told me of the sexual harassment and abuse they have endured ndash with offences ranging all the way up to rape.I should not have been astonished, then, that over the last few days, after I wrote about my daughter, that I was met with a tidal wave of pain from women contacting me to tell of victimisation and abuse. But I was astonished. Hundreds of women contacted me through social media or by email to offer their love and support to my daughter, many said they empathised with her because the same, or worse, had happened to them. These were women Irsquove never met, that I do not know ndash they had no reason to share their suffering with me, a man. But these women were outraged on behalf of my daughter, and they wanted to share their anger. Their words and kindness often moved me to tears.Many told me they or their daughters had gone through exactly the same set of circumstances as Caitie. One woman said Caitiersquos story lsquoresonates personally due to my own daughterrsquos appalling experiencersquo. Another told how she was the victim of a stalker and lsquolived in hell for three years while the police did nothingrsquo.Read more: My daughters hellAnother woman described how a man exposed himself to her aunt and a friend and were laughed at by police when they reported it. Some women spoke of being victims of sexual offences but keeping silent because they believed the police would not help them, due to the experiences of friends and family. A woman even said that a police officer asked her for oral sex and then told her he knew where she lived. A psychologist said they had heard many stories of police failings by victims of sex crimes.One terrible story was of a disabled woman being sexually assaulted and the case quickly closed. In one of the most distressing stories, a woman reported being sexually assaulted by a man in a town street while police watched, and did nothing. One mother told of police humiliating her teenage daughter during an interview after she was the victim of an offence ndash in the end there was no prosecution either.The dreadful truth, though, is that none of this is new. It wasnrsquot new last year when a predatory president walked into the Oval Office with a string of sexual assault claims hanging around his neck, and it wasnrsquot new millennia ago either. Women are the historic victims of men.Sure, there is change in the air across the world ndash womenrsquos marches, the rise of MeToo, the shaming of corporations over pay inequality ndash but dear God, this is .

The SNPrsquos official position is that a referendum is necessary. Ms Sturgeon has argued a fresh independence push can only be made once the outcome of the Brexit negotiations becomes clear.But yesterday she said a second referendum before  was ldquostill possible, stressing the Scottish Parliament has a mandate to push ahead with a new vote.Deputy leader Keith Brown told SNP delegates the party was ldquostepping up the campaign for independence. But the cautious approach favoured by the leadership provoked unhappiness among some delegates. One told a Brexit fringe meeting that members were ldquovery frustrated with constantly being told to just wait and suggested time was ldquoslipping away.Addressing the SNP conference, Ms Sturgeon will insist an independent Scotland would offer an escape from the chaos engulfing Westminster. She will say: ldquoThe Westminster Government stumbles from day to day and disaster to disaster. Itrsquos hard to watch that unfolding calamity and feel anything other than despair.ldquoSo it is up to us ndash now more than ever ndash to offer optimism and hope.ldquoJust think how much more hope will be possible when we take Scotlandrsquos future into Scotlandrsquos hands and become an independent country.ldquoAn independent Scotland, just as Scotland is now, will be a beacon for progressive values ndash equality, opportunity, ersity and fairness.ldquoIndeed those values feel more important today than ever before in my letime.The First Minister will insist the SNP Government is working ldquoday in, day out, step by step, to change lives for the better.She will announce a new default position ndash dubbed ldquoFair Work First ndash which will see firms receiving Government contracts and grants required to pay the living wage, ditch zero-hours contracts and take action on gender pay gaps.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said Ms Sturgeon had ldquoled the SNP troops half way into battle, and then called halt.He said: ldquoWhen it comes to Scotlandrsquos future, everyone in the SNP has an opinion but nobody has a plan.ldquoAll the while, Scotlandrsquos schools are going backwards, waiting times are being missed, and the economy is in the slow lane.ldquoNicola Sturgeon can show leadership today by doing the right thing: and taking a second referendum off the table.

The conference this week is clearly showing that.Earlier, the FM was slapped down by Theresa May, who urged the FM to ldquorespect the result of the  independence referendum, making clear she would not facilitate another vote on Scotlandrsquos future in this parliament.The PMs rebuttal came after Ms Sturgeon had earlier insisted it would be ldquoabsurd and ldquoanti-democratic for Mrs May to refuse to facilitate a second vote on Scotlands future and that such a position could not be sustained.When it was pointed out, as in , the Scottish Government would require a legal settlement with the UK Government - which, through Westminster, has the power over constitutional matters, such as holding referendums ndash and that the PM had made clear she would not agree to one, the SNP leader said: ldquoI find this argumenthellipis just accepted is really absurd.

The reason, Sir Howard is reported as saying, is that as the bank has staged ldquoone of the biggest corporate turnarounds in history it is now ldquofully focused on building a much better bank for our customers.It is not the first time that the bank has tried to distance itself from the RBS moniker, with a  decision seeing it drop the name from  branches across the UK in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland north of the Border and NatWest south of it. The plan now is to stop using it in a corporate context, which essentially means when trying to find institutions interested in buying its shares.The thing is, RBS has come a long way in the past  years. Having grown into an unwieldy international behemoth under the leadership of former boss Fred ldquothe shred Goodwin, the business has slimmed down into something far more recognisable as a mainstream British bank. It has also taken some steps to right past wrongdoings by paying compensation to certain shareholders and customers who were affected by its actions.Signs that RBS was finally starting to emerge from the wilderness came earlier this year when the institution made a profit then paid a idend for the first time in a decade. When, in August, it agreed to pay pound. billion to settle a US Department of Justice investigation that had hung over it for the same period of time, RBS was able finally to draw a faint line under its past misdemeanours.To rebrand now, just when City analysts think the bank is starting to look investable again, would seem almost as wacky as taking part in the poundbn take-over of a Dutch bank on which limited due diligence had been done. Indeed, while RBS may have been well advised to reinvent itself in the immediate aftermath of its bailout, it would seem there is no pressing need for it to do so now.Sure RBS continues to be dogged by problems, as evidenced by it being labelled Britainrsquos worst bank for customer service by the Competition and Markets Authority and the worst for handling PPI claims by consumer group Which .Its decision to plough ahead with branch closures in the face of a signicant public backlash has also done its reputation no favours, with the fact that other banks are doing exactly the same thing having no truck with a public that feels it has a vested interest in RBS thanks to the Treasury retaining a signicant shareholding in it.But these issues are small fry compared to what RBS has been through over the past  years, and as it is facing them from a position of relative corporate strength they are hardly worth reinventing itself for now. As brand expert Marc Cloosterman wrote in US publication Branding Strategy Insider in June, a business with a bad reputation may use a rebranding exercise to ldquoameliorate or dispel negative associationsthat reputation is ldquohaving a serious impact on its operating results.But with RBS seemingly well on the road to recovery the pressure on its brand has eased and, with investors liking nothing better than a company that is clearly on the up, surely it is only a matter of time before its brand is rehabilitated too.That it is given the chance to do this is important not just for the bank but for Scotland as well. Like brand identity, national identity is a tricky concept to pin down, but it essentially revolves around how disparate groups of people use symbols and ideas to bind themselves to one another in an image of togetherness.Being measured in our financial dealings has long been seen as an essential part of what it is to be Scottish, with the way we behave as iniduals shaping our institutions and informing the way we are viewed by others. It is fair to say that RBS has been a huge embarrassment to Scotland, and rightly so, but that is because the country helped shape the bankrsquos reputation for canniness in the first place.Planning to get rid of the RBS brand may be more about a bank that is now run from London wanting to distance itself from the nation whose image it helped to tarnish. But to obliterate a name we were once so proud of just when the institution behind it is starting to emerge as something better would be to do a disservice to all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-minister-likens-brexit-to-the-highland-clearances","story":"Christina McKelvie, minister for older people and equalities, said both involved wealthy elites telling people what to do.She told a fringe meeting at the SNPs conference in Glasgow:\"Rich, privileged, entitled people, shting people to the clf edge  years ago,  years ago, now.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online.

The Nationalists have become the ultimate stuck record.: Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence ‘clearly in sight’None of this would matter too muchthe SNP wasn’t also running the Government in Scotland. Unfortunately it is. And we are suffering the consequences. Nicola Sturgeon said two years ago that education would be her number one priority in government. Yet, staggeringly, in her speech yesterday there was barely any mention of education at all. It was a glaring omission but in truth it is little wonder – the SNP has dumped its flagship education bill, has lost the trust of many teachers on the front-line, and is presiding over a crisis in teacher numbers and restricted subject choice.After  years in Government, the SNP is looking tired. Its leader’s conference speech exposed a party that has little left to say – apart from the one thing they really care about. Like many Scots, I’ve run out of patience with the SNP’s one-track mindset.

According to official statistics, the average age of a UK resident has risen by two years, to  and it is anticipated that within  years, one in four people will be aged  and over.However, not everyone will avoid illness, whether physical or mental, as they get older, and this means that there will inevitably be a greater responsibility on the younger generations to care for others, whether they are parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts or even in some cases, those who are not family.A recent report from the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland revealed that ship orders rose  per cent between - and the year before, to ,. These figures bring into sharp focus the increasing onus on us as a population to be aware of the potential caring obligations we may encounter during our lives.The majority of ships are for people with a learning disability, and not far behind are dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In most cases, applications for ships are made by a relative, or a carer, or even a friend. But the key point is that in many situations, the need to have the power to look after the affairs of another can be unexpected andplans haven’t been put in place, the consequences can be expensive but more importantly stressful for all involved.: Alzheimer’s, dementia is most common cause of death for Scots womenships can be a helpful option when the necessary care of another has been identied, but it can also be a complex, y and expensive legal process.For one group in particular, the process can be a source of tension and anxiety at a time when they are possibly least prepared. The sandwich generation – so-called due to their job of caring and paying for both their children and their parents, or grandparents – can find themselves being stretched emotionally and financially.This group have found themselves under increasing pressure, particularly since the financial crisis and the period of austerity we’ve seen since then. Wage rises have been sluggish at best in the last few years and – combined with the signicant increases in house prices, especially in Edinburgh and the surrounding areas – the financial burden has risen considerably. In many cases, both partners are working to pay for day-to-day necessities, including child care, but the calls on income don’t stop there. We’re regularly reminded of the need to try and save for our own retirement and, for those who didn’t begin to do this early in their working lives, the cost can be signicant. A sudden additional cost may well curtail the ability to do this, with the inevitable longer term knock-on effects.Putting in place a ship order is not something that is ever considered lightly but the simple fact is that we can never know when orany of us or our family will lose our ability to manage our own affairs or make decisions for ourselves, making the order necessary. : Amy McKay: Powers of Attorney are for everyone In effect, acan be likened to an attorney appointed by a court. Unless legal aid is available, the cost of the process can run into the many thousands of pounds and there is absolutely no certainty that the inidual chosen or appointed would have been your preferred option.The Scottish Government has recognised the issues around ship process and is committed to reforming the Adults with Incapacity Act. However until there is a final outcome, there are some actions that everyone can take to ensure that le is made easier, particularly for those who may have to care for us.There is a system in place to cater for those eventualities where iniduals no longer possess the ability to care for themselves. A Power of Attorney is a legal document which brings with it a range of rights and responsibilities. At its core, it gives one person the power to act on behalf of another, either financially or in welfare matters and decision-making. The safeguards are clear, and most importantly it can only be set up while you have the ability to make decisions for yourself. It is also much quicker, cheaper and less complex than a ship order, and it allows you to retain control and choose who you wish to make decisions on your behalf, thereby providing the peace of mind we’d all desire.None of us would ever want to consider the possibility of someone like our parents being unable to look after their own affairs. Neither, I suspect, do we want others to find themselves in a dficult situationwe ourselves were to be incapacitated to a similar degree.For those that can, we have a responsibility to make the appropriate arrangements for the unexpected.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact.

Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1061698.jpg--.jpg?1538468189000\n","title":"ruby s birthday","story":"AN Ahoghill family are holding a fundraising event for Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice to commemorate the care given to their daughter, little Ruby Powell.Ruby passed away when she was just five years old on November , , at the Hospice.The fundraising event will be called Rubys Birthday Fundraiser and will be held on Saturday, November  at Ahoghill Community Centre, on what would have been Rubys sixth birthday.Ruby was born with a severe brain injury and was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy, Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy and Multi Focal Epilepsy. Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes. There will even be a live male wax at pm!The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le.

We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well.

Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":null,"title":"3k for northern ireland man told he was too old for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\". It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\". Ms Kitson added: \"That goes to the heart of the case and it quite rightly caused Mr Matier major disappointment at a time when he was attempting to re-enter the workplace in very trying circumstances.\"No employer should be making assumptions about a persons ability, or suitability for training and promotion, because of their age.\"Spring  AirbrakeLtd said it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision and will be applying to have it reviewed.It said: \"This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for any employer defending claims of discrimination, in that the tribunal determined that the claimant was discriminated against, despite ascertaining that the evidence of the claimant was a little imprecise and vague.\"On behalf of the respondents, we will be applying to have this decision formally reviewed.\"We also intend writing to the Department for Communities seeking a review of their recruitment services. \"The respondent followed the approved process for advertising their vacancy with the Jobs and Benefits Office and strictly adhered to the procedure.\"The company said the absence of an employment appeal tribunal led to an \"imbalance\".It added: \"Should a review fail to address the shortcomings of this decision, the only avenue open to the respondent is to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, which for any company is extremely prohibitive financially.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland airbnb licencing legal action withdrawn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

He referred to recent comments by Arlene Foster that the Good Friday Agreement could be altered to accommodate a Brexit deal, as well as her \"outburst\" on her opposition to any suggestion of a border down the Irish Sea when she referred to a \"blood red line\" as evidence of this.\"The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power-sharing,\" he said.\"The DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.\"Warning the DUP that it could not expect toto an Executive while it continues to \"oppose equality and rights\" on social issues such as same-sex marriage and the Irish Language Act, Mr Kearney stressed that it must show accommodation on these issues.\"The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism,\" he said.Urging \"whoever is in charge\" of the DUP to do some soul searching, Mr Kearney said the party must address itself whether or not it can commit to a \"shared future with republicans, nationalist and others\".\"Unless, and untilcan clearly answer these questions... it will remain exactly where it is now: out of power,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"weather northern ireland to bask in brief indian summer before hazardous winds on friday","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

of that romantic idea that is Europe.”Mr Tajani thanked the singer for his engagement in the European project, adding: “If we want to protect our citizens we need the European umbrella.\" width\"\"

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics. We are so grateful to them, as this allowed us as a family to spend more time with Cindy. with Simon Calvert of The Christian Institute arriving at an earlier court hearing in Belfast\"   with Simon Calvert of The Christian Institute arriving at an earlier court hearing in Belfast\"  VIDEO: UK’s highest court to rule on Ashers ‘gay cake’ case appealPeers: ‘It would be better to fund victims of the Troubles than spend many millions on legacy investigations’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We were all there as a family at her beside - everyone had a hand on her as she passed away at .pm on Thursday afternoon,” said Alan.Cindy’s daughter Rachel said: “Mum always said the worst thing a parent could watch was a child go before them. But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

Lord Hain, the lead signatory to the letter In the letter, which is reproduced in this newspaper , the eight members of the House Of Lords talk of “signicant direct ministerial or parliamentary experience in Northern Ireland”, and saythey are writing in response to the invitation to comment on the consultation on the mooted legacy bodies.“We understand why many victims and others attach great importance to the prosecution, conviction and sentencing of those responsible for the appalling loss they have suffered,” the peers write. “But experience suggests that it would be a mistake to expect that judicial outcome in any but a tiny percentage of the crimes that have not already been dealt with.”The signatories, including the ex-NI secretaries Lord Reid and Lord Murphy, note that the Historical Enquiries Team completed work on , Troubles deaths, of which “only  were referred to the Public Prosecution Service and only three resulted in prosecutions and convictions for murder”.The likely number of prosecutions arising from the proposed Historical Investigations Unit, they add, is “very small”.   One of the signatories, Lord Eames “It must be worth at least pausing to consider whether this is the best possible use of £m.”The peers add: “We note also that currently prosecutions are being considered for formermembers of the armed forces – perhaps because records and information are more readily available – but none so far as we can establish for paramilitaries.“That cannot be right.”However, they add, they are not seeking an amnesty. Rather, they think that the many millions of pounds would be better directed to the most badly injured victims of the Troubles.   The former secretary of state, Tom King The signatories are Lord Browne of Ladyton, Lord Cormack, Lord Eames, Lord Hain, Lord King of Bridgwater, Lord Murphy of Torfaen, Lord Patten of Barnes and Lord Reid of Cardowan.The letter to Ms Bradley spells fresh dficulty for the proposed Stormont House structures, which have been strongly criticised by a range of voices in the News Letter’s Stop The Legacy Scandal series of essays on the imbalance in the way that the past is being examined.The ground-breaking campaign, which began in August and will continue until later this month, has comprised articles by academics, politicians, lawyers, commentators, churchmen, former members of the security forces and, most important of all, victims of terrorism who have had and expect no justice or truth on what happened to their loved ones, amid a massive focus on killings by the security forces.PSNI to host National Black Police Association conference in Belfast Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The eight peers, who have released their letter to Ms Bradley to all of the media, write: “All in all, we are reinforced in our judgment that the priority is surely now to resource victims not investigations that have little or no likelihood of either prosecution or alternative closure satisfactory to victims.”• See the letter by clicking here• For essays in our legacy scandal series click hereJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8662492.1539096297!/image/image.jpg","title":"health","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Health   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Health Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Health      Report: Therapeutic fasting lsquocan reverse Type  diabetesrsquoMore evidence has come to light about patients #reversing# their Type  diabetes by changing their diets.

Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously. tag  documenttag.src  \"https:www.youtube player_api\" firstScriptTag  document[]firstScriptTagAt the age of , the Comber lad saved up his pennies and enrolled in a wrestling camp in England where he was told he needed to lose weighthe was serious about making it in the sports entertainment industry.And so, Grant hit the gym and began a journey that would seem him become Dunkan Disorderly.Now , not surprisingly, he runs his own gym.At one stage he could have pushed for a move to the WWE but he chose family over fame and fortune.   Grant during what he describes as his chubby teenage years He said: “I loved wrestling as a kid. I never grew out of it I suppose. I played a bit of football, a bit of rugby, but my heart really wasn’t in it.“I always wanted to do wrestling but there weren’t any opportunities in Northern Ireland.“I saw an advertisement in a wrestling magazine for a wrestling camp over in Kent called Hammerlock. I saved up my money and went and did that when I was .“I just kept going back as regularly as I could for the next few years.   Comber wrestler Grant Davison aka Dunkan Disorderly “It’s the same school that Finn Balor [WWE superstar] went to. There were a lot of great names over the years who trained at Hammerlock.”Grant said that while he was growing up he had problems with his weight, but some harsh words from a wrestling promoter gave him the motivation to get into shape.He said: “I was a pretty chubby kid. After my first wrestling camp when I was , the promoter told me, ‘you have to hit the gym, nobody wants to see their nextdoor neighbour in spandex’. I’ll never forget that.Belfast City Council slammed by unionists as Irish language officer appointed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Basicallyyou want to be a wrestler you have to look like one.“That’s when my fitness journey began. I started lting weights. That’s  years ago, I haven’t stopped since.”The former Grosvenor Grammar pupil said: “In Upper Sixth my body really started to change. Over the summer I remember just hitting the gym every day and coming back to school for the new term and people were like, ‘wow, where’s the rest of you’. I’d lost a lot of body fat and started to bulk up.“It’s amazing how suspectable your body is to change when you’re young. When you get older it’s more dficult.“I’ve always been naturally strong and fast for a big dude. Me and the gym were just made for each other.”Of his favourite wrestlers as a boy, Grant said: “When I was a kid the big names I was looking up to were Macho Man Randy Savage, The Ultimate Warrior and Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart.”Of those three wrestlers only Bret Hart, now , is still alive. As an industry, wrestling would seem to have a disproportionate number of early deaths, with drugs a factor in some cases.Grant said: “I think back in the late s, early s there was a lot of drugs going on, and no drug testing being done.“There was a lot more abuse of substances that would have been a factor in some of the early deaths.“It seems to be a lot more in check now. There’s a lot more drug testing than there ever was. Wrestlers tend to be living longer these days which is good to know.”After the camps at Hammerlock, Grant joined a jujitsu club to keep himself ‘ring fresh’. Along with some of the young men from the club he formed a company called Ulster Championship Wrestling.He said: “We started booking the Threepenny Bit at the Kings Hall and put on a lot of shows there.“I got a bit of notoriety and started to get bookings to come down to Dublin to wrestle. I started to appear in more shows throughout Ireland, picking up more dates.“We disbanded UCW to go on and do our own things.“I was getting paid good money to just turn up and wrestle without having to do any of the dirty work like booking venues, setting up the ring, putting up posters, ticket sales and things like that.”He continued: “I used to tour years ago with a company called AWR, we toured all over Europe. At that point all I wanted to do was go to the big leagues, to the WWE.”However Grant’s outlook on le was to change:“Circumstances changed in my home le and I really wanted to have a family, be a good daddy, not miss out on kids birthdays which is a sacrice you have to makeyou want to go to the big leagues. “You have to be prepared to work five nights a week, come home, do the laundry and get back up and go again. I didn’t want to be that kind of daddy.“In about  I made the decision to stay close to home. I haven’t worked overseas since. My daughter was born the following year.”Grant’s daughter Heidi is seven and his son Jaxon is five. He also has two step daughters – Mia and Aimee.He said: “Family is very important to me. I still wrestle most weekends, I enjoy that, but I’ve come a long way with my le outside the gym and I no longer have that same ambition to wrestle in the big leagues.“The highlight of my day is getting home and seeing the kids before the go to bed. I wouldn’t want to miss that for the WWE.“The love of your family is far more important than the love of wrestling fans. Wrestling fans will forget about you when you retire. They don’t know the real you either.”Having qualied as a personal trainer, Grant finally realised his dream of opening his own gym two years ago.Zeus Training Zone which is located just outside Comber was shortlisted in the top five small gyms in the Province for the NI Fitness Awards.Asked whether he was anything like Dunkan Disorderly, Grant said: “Me and Dunkan are very dferent. When you’re wrestling you’re a showman. You’ve got to go out there and be aggressive, intense. You’re playing a character. It was the big characters that drew me into wrestling. “I gave myself the name Dunkan Disorderly  years ago and I’ve stuck with it. I’m not like Dunkan at all, though it depends what time of day you get me at. If you ask my kids they’d say I’m a big softie.“I wrestle mostly as a babyface, a good guy. I do occasionally wrestle as a heelas well.“I do get really worked up in the ring. I’m in the zone. I thinksome of my gym clients saw me they’d be really surprised.”Prior to WWE broadcasts a warning is issued: Don’t try this at home. Has Grant followed that advice “Everybody tries it at home. Or in the playground at school. “My son is five and we’re forever wrestling. Obviously not the really crazy stuff.”Dunkan will be among the wrestlers taking part in wrestling.ie’s tour of Northern Ireland and Ireland.Among the visiting wrestlers as part of the tour is Londoner Tiny Iron aka Andrew Harrison, the man who famously lted BBC star Stephen Nolan aloft live on air.Also taking to the ring at selected dates is Northern Ireland-born Love Island star Adam ‘Flex’ Maxted who is visiting from his home in Newcastle, England.There will be four shows in Northern Ireland during the tour. There are in Coleraine Town Hall on October , Queen’s Hall in Newtownards on October , the Killyhevlin Hotel in Enniskillen on November , Armagh City Hotel on November .

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics. We are so grateful to them, as this allowed us as a family to spend more time with Cindy.Kneed teenager in head and kicked him on ground Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We were all there as a family at her beside - everyone had a hand on her as she passed away at .pm on Thursday afternoon,” said Alan.Cindy’s daughter Rachel said: “Mum always said the worst thing a parent could watch was a child go before them. But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

This is to protect the safety of road users, the public and construction workers. It may also be necessary at some locations for work to be undertaken outside of normal working hours, evening night time, to reduce disruption to road users and businesses.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next.
