The couple are pictured together in a Facebook photo          Pictured above is Russell at what appears to be at a wedding. He posted the photo at the end of one of his YouTube videos Rick Christenson, retired from Horizon Air, told the DailyMail.com that Russell was \u0027quiet\u0027 and \u0027a nice kid\u0027.Christenson didn\u0027t supervise Russell\u0027s team, but said he saw the 29-year-old in passing while at work. \u0027He always had a nice smile,\u0027 he said. \u0027He seemed quiet, and he always had a smile. The people that knew him said he was a nice guy.\u0027 Christenson said he was sitting on his deck Friday night at his Tacoma home with his wife, his cousin and his cousin\u0027s wife when he saw the Horizon Q400 fly over his house. \u0027All of a sudden one of the Horizon Q400s came over the house at 500 feet, followed by two F-15s one was high, one was low,\u0027 Christenson said, adding that he knew something was wrong because the plane was flying way too low.He added in a separate interview: \u0027Everybody\u0027s stunned... that something like this would happen. How could it? Everybody\u0027s been through background checks.\u0027The former supervisor said he grabbed a pair of binoculars to watch the aircraft, admitting that he was \u0027scared\u0027 and \u0027concerned\u0027 because he didn\u0027t know what was going on. \u0027He was doing a lot of weird flying, weird turns,\u0027 he said, \u0027but he was coming back towards us, towards our way.\u0027 Christenson said while the plane was over the water it did a 360 degree roll \u0027and went into a steep e\u0027. \u0027He brought the one wing up and the whole airplane rolled and as it rolled it went into a e. It looked control,\u0027 he said, adding that the plane pulled up with less than 50 feet between the nose of the aircraft and the water. Christenson said two minutes later there was \u0027big plume of black smoke\u0027, indicating the plane had crashed.         Two F-15 fighter jets scrambled from Portland \u0027minutes later\u0027 to intercept it, according to Pierce County Sheriff\u0027s Office.

Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears. He said, “They will eat you alive.” He was right.’    Prince Harry (pictured) called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suitInstead of taking Harry’s advice, Mr Markle made a secret arrangement to pose for a series of pictures – a decision he now bitterly regrets. The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it. I’m done.’Kensington Palace declined to comment last night.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/14/4EF7FE1200000578-0-image-m-25_1533906561537.jpg","title":"I breathe Im itchy properly Liz Jones describes week wearing burka","story":"    Liz Jones was challenged with spending an entire week wearing a full burkaI remember during my week catching sight of my reflection in a shop window in Knightsbridge. Instead of seeing me, I saw a woman who was hunched and shuffling. A dark, depressed alien. A smudge. A nothing.I’ve long felt antagonistic towards women who wear the burka. I would see a woman on the streets of London, a black crow at the side of a husband or male relative, and I’d roll my eyes and tut loudly. I put the rights of women and girls to dress as they please before the rights of people of any particular faith. How dare you demean yourself in this way, I would think as I walked past. You insult every woman who died fighting for your rights and your freedom.The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sand. In Afghanistan, the burka is known as the chadri it has a thick grill over the mouth and eyes, and is the one I chose to wear. The chadri only became a common sight when the Taliban came to power, banning women from wearing cosmetics, and shoes with a heel: the noise of a heel on pavement was said to be too arousing for men to cope with.I remember in Kabul meeting former TV newsreaders, businesswomen, who once wore Manolos and lipstick, forced to cover up. They were cowed, mere shadows of their former selves, now unemployed, able only to sit at home.\u0027We have a thing called freedom of speech in this country\u0027:...Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ‘witch hunt’...Share this articleDuring my week in the shadows, I soon found out why: there is no way a woman can work in one. Each time I had to go to meet or interview someone, I had to take the headpiece off. I couldn’t even see to type. Most importantly, I couldn’t think straight.That first day, I was afraid to put it on. When I did pluck up courage, I felt suffocated, as though forced to live inside a dark tent. I got in my car to go to the station and realised there was no way I could drive safely with my eyes blinkered like a racehorse. Already deaf, the fabric snuffed out any residual sound.On the walk to the station I could hardly breathe. My shroud made me itch all over, and my eyelashes kept banging against the cloth. A friend recently came back from a spell working in Qatar and said that whenever he drove he had to keep swerving to avoid running over the flocks of women who stumble on to roads. ‘They are like children. They have to be guided by men. None of them speak. It’s like the Middle Ages.’I felt scared, vulnerable.I walked to the kiosk to buy coffee. ‘Mumble mumble,’ I said to the young man serving. To his credit – the station is in a rural area, so I’m sure this was the first time he had encountered a full veil – he didn’t bat an eye, and smiled. I pointed. I automatically lifted the cup to my lips. Ah. How was I going to do this? I tried to work the cup up the inside of the cloth, performing an elaborate jig on the platform, but got stuck halfway.Later that day, at a coffee shop in Fulham, I sat outside at a table, faced with a sandwich and a latte. As I weighed up my hunger, an Arabic man shouted abuse at the white, male photographer sent to chronicle my day. I have no idea what he was saying – perhaps I shouldn’t have been eating in public – but the interesting point is that during the entire experiment, he was the only person who gave me any abuse.    Women wearing a burka, clothing that covers their entire bodies shopping at a bazaarThe only time I became furious at my treatment was when, for a domestic flight, I swanned through security unmolested, when normally I’m made to remove jacket and shoes. This smacked of PC pandering. I was heartened, though, that throughout my week I was only ever met with helping hands.Getting into a cab in London I was still called ‘darlin’ by the driver. Getting out of said cab, a passing decorator opened the door and grabbed my shopping – a burka makes you clumsy, slow, helpless I spent most of the week feeling like a disabled person.In fact, the only curious glances I attracted were from small children and my border collies, who started barking like maniacs.One day, I had lunch with a friend in Primrose Hill. She walked past my table three times. I waggled my Prada bag, which I thought she might recognise.‘How fantastic,’ she said when at last she realised it was me. ‘You don’t have to bother to put on make-up or wash your hair. How much spare time you must have!’ This was a common response from my much-groomed, often scantily-clad female friends.I admit, too, this rather jokey response had, as someone who never leaves the house without having had my roots retouched, crossed my mind. Aren’t we in the West equally imprisoned by the pressure to be perfect?But having worn my burka (it’s still upstairs in a box, like the ashes of a dead pet), I find that attitude naive. Telling women to cast it off, making a joke of how they appear, is disrespectful of those who are forced to wear what amounts to a mobile prison for fear of being beaten, or worse.You become not just not female, you become inhuman. All through my week I’d worn scent, something I never normally do, so compelling was the feeling I had to be feminine in some small way.I was supposed, during my sentence in purdah, to wear trainers so as not to expose ‘toe cleavage’, but I got so hot I resorted to flip flops: the steam had to escape somehow.          The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sandThe second most common response from Western women was that, thank goodness, at least men won’t leer. Well, this isn’t a problem I face daily. Yes, of course it’s helpful not to walk along dark alleys in a miniskirt and boob tube, but let’s not forget the extremely high incidence of rape in countries where the burka is prevalent. Extreme modesty does not breed safety.The ridiculous claim the burka protects women from male harassment was wheeled out yet again on Woman’s Hour. A British Muslim woman defended her ‘choice’ because not only did it bring her ‘closer to God’ but because ‘before I used to get men asking for my number, can they have dinner with me’.I’ve no idea what she looks like but to evoke that response she must be up there with Ava Gardner. She went on: ‘I’m not going to stop because people are ignorant. I have had so much abuse on the train.’Well, she has obviously never travelled with First Great Western. On my trips back and forth I found both passengers and staff courteous. At one point, after a particularly hot day in Regent’s Park, trying to lick a 99, I wobbled to the buffet car and mumbled for a G\u0026ampT. ‘Would you like ice with that?’ the young lady asked, deadpan.Rather than being the brunt of abuse, I felt that by wearing a veil I was the one being rude. I had to keep tucking my hair back, like Audrey Hepburn as she disappeared forever, married to Christ in The Nun’s Story, and started to wonder: what is so disgusting about the female form that it has to be hidden?On yet another perfect summer’s day in Hyde Park during my week covered up, I saw a crocodile of schoolchildren, aged maybe nine or ten. Several of the girls were in headscarves: only the small moon of their faces exposed. For the first time I knew how they were feeling: different. Hot. How about, too, marginalised, objectified, kept fresh only for the eyes of their male relatives?After just a few days, what I mostly felt was exhausted. I asked a young Muslim woman who lives Bristol how on earth she coped and she answered: ‘You just have to get used to it.’ I’d rather not, thanks very much. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/11/22/4F0798F200000578-0-image-m-33_1534024789233.jpg","title":"Labour struggle repair damaging rift Jeremy Corbyn John McDonnell","story":"    Labour is struggling to repair a damaging rift between Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell over the anti-Semitism row rocking the partyBut insiders say the Shadow Chancellor, seen as crucial to Mr Corbyn’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister, is appalled at how the problem has been dealt with by the leader’s top team.

My own experience with him on the radio has been that he makes controversial comments to elicit controversial responses! This makes for good radio but it can offend this or that person or section of the population.We shouldn’t be too alarmed by this because freedom of expression necessarily involves the possibility of giving offence, as long as there is no threat to the safety of an inidual or community or of discrimination against them.The furore, however, about his language regarding the appearance of those wearing the burqa or niqab, has meant that many have missed his extremely relaxed attitude to the actual wearing of these garments in public situations.The only restrictions he seems to countenance have to do with private preferences or rules in schools or offices.Like him,I am not in favour of an absolute ban on the burqa but unlike him, I am in favour of a qualified ban on wearing the burqa or niqab in a wide range of situations.I am not for a total ban because that would violate the freedom of people to dress as they choose when they are at home, with friends or at their place of worship.There are many reasons, however, for restricting the wearing of these garments in a number of important areas of our common life.    Former British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson sparked controversy recently with his comments about burkasI come myself from both a Muslim and Christian family background and have lived and worked in Muslim majority communities.I have had beloved aunts who, at first, wore the burqa and then abandoned it because it was incompatible with their work as schoolteachers.I have seen also how increasingly ‘ modest’ dress, whether the burqa, on the frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the niqab in Egypt or the chador in Iran, is being imposed on women in the name of religion, custom or culture.We cannot assume that such compulsion is not taking place in this country!We have all seen how even male terrorists have escaped arrest by donning a burqa and making an effective getaway.For reasons of national security, there will be places like Parliament or Whitehall or town halls and council chambers where the burqa should not be allowed.Government and local authority buildings, as well as institutions like universities and schools, will want to know the identities of those who come to visit, work or study, not only at the point of entry but throughout the day.There needs to be legislative and regulatory backing for such bodies to be able to ban the burqa and the niqab on their premises.Immigration and border control is another area where a ban is required.This is, of course, to determine the identity of those entering or leaving the country but it is also necessary to maintain adequate security in and around our ports and airports.Those responsible for our security need to able to tell, by people’s behaviour in public places, including facial expressions, whether they are a danger to others.The courts have ruled already that a face veil must be removed at the time of testifying but this is not enough.Judge, jurors and counsel will also want to observe the facial expressions, of those involved in a trial, at other stages, when different people are testifying or when counsel for the defence or prosecution are arguing their case.          Some choose to wear the burqa  because they feel it makes them more observant MuslimsMany professions require personal interaction with the client.In business, both the trader and the customer should be able to see one another’s face and to interpret expressions, if the transaction is to be mutually beneficial.This is even more true of doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics.They need to know, from facial expression, how a patient is feeling, if they are in pain and whether pain has been relieved through treatment.Those engaged in therapeutic counselling and in social work, similarly, have to be able to tell, by observing the face, the extent of a person’s distress or well being.Both Boris Johnson and Jack Straw have declared that they would refuse to see someone from their constituency if they were wearing a face veil because that would make a real conversation very difficult. Such a difficulty extends to those working in job and advice centres and in any number of community and family projects.I have seen women driving in some countries with a niqab or other voluminous covering.How they do so safely is a mystery to me! Public safety on roads means that those wearing burqa, niqab or other full head covering, which obscures all round vision, should not be allowed to operate vehicles where they pose a danger to the public.This must also be true of operating certain kinds of machinery at the work place or of working in difficult terrain or challenging weather conditions.Again, the Police, The DVSA and employers will need legislative sanction if they are to enforce such bans.It is true that some women choose to wear the burqa or niqab because they feel it makes them more observant Muslims although there doesn’t seem to be anything in the Qur’an or in Islamic law that requires this.It is also true, however, that the burqa or niqab is being weaponised by Islamists to impose what they consider to be ‘ Islamic’ character on communities, neighbourhoods and even nations.Culture and custom can also be appealed to in persuading women to take the face veil.In Britain, this has serious implications for the freedom of women but it also has implications for integration and social cohesion.Where there is widespread use of the face veil, there will be greater isolation from one another and a sense of segregation will grow.          Young Saudis, including three women wearing the traditional niqab and black abayas, relax on the Corniche waterfront in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaWhile Islamists have succeeded in introducing or re-introducing the veil in a number of countries, other countries, like Egypt, are resisting this trend.The highest Islamic authorities there have banned it in educational institutions and Parliament is considering legislation to ban it altogether.What is happening there has certainly influenced the European debate and we also need to learn from Egypt and other countries about the social and health consequences of observing strict purdah or the seclusion of women, including the wearing of face veils.Boris Johnson claims that banning the burqa would result in a general crackdown on wearing any religious symbols in public.The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, has said, similarly, that banning the burqa is like banning Christians from wearing the crucifix.Neither of these claims bear examination.A crucifix, or similar religious symbol, does not conceal anyone’s identity or expression nor can it be used to conceal a weapon which could be a danger to the public.When are we going to stop always seeking equivalences between Christianity and other religious beliefs?Christianity has given us our civilisation, our values and the dignity and freedom of the person.Let us celebrate that instead of always dragging it down to the lowest common denominator!We need then both to uphold personal freedom and regulation for the sake of the public good.For weighty reasons of security, safety on our roads, control of our borders and professional conduct, the wearing of full face veils can be and should be restricted in our society. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/14/4EF7FE1200000578-0-image-m-25_1533906561537.jpg","title":"I breathe Im itchy properly Liz Jones describes week wearing burka","story":"    Liz Jones was challenged with spending an entire week wearing a full burkaI remember during my week catching sight of my reflection in a shop window in Knightsbridge. Instead of seeing me, I saw a woman who was hunched and shuffling. A dark, depressed alien. A smudge. A nothing.I’ve long felt antagonistic towards women who wear the burka. I would see a woman on the streets of London, a black crow at the side of a husband or male relative, and I’d roll my eyes and tut loudly. I put the rights of women and girls to dress as they please before the rights of people of any particular faith. How dare you demean yourself in this way, I would think as I walked past. You insult every woman who died fighting for your rights and your freedom.The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sand. In Afghanistan, the burka is known as the chadri it has a thick grill over the mouth and eyes, and is the one I chose to wear. The chadri only became a common sight when the Taliban came to power, banning women from wearing cosmetics, and shoes with a heel: the noise of a heel on pavement was said to be too arousing for men to cope with.I remember in Kabul meeting former TV newsreaders, businesswomen, who once wore Manolos and lipstick, forced to cover up. They were cowed, mere shadows of their former selves, now unemployed, able only to sit at home.\u0027We have a thing called freedom of speech in this country\u0027:...Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ‘witch hunt’...Share this articleDuring my week in the shadows, I soon found out why: there is no way a woman can work in one. Each time I had to go to meet or interview someone, I had to take the headpiece off. I couldn’t even see to type. Most importantly, I couldn’t think straight.That first day, I was afraid to put it on. When I did pluck up courage, I felt suffocated, as though forced to live inside a dark tent. I got in my car to go to the station and realised there was no way I could drive safely with my eyes blinkered like a racehorse. Already deaf, the fabric snuffed out any residual sound.On the walk to the station I could hardly breathe. My shroud made me itch all over, and my eyelashes kept banging against the cloth. A friend recently came back from a spell working in Qatar and said that whenever he drove he had to keep swerving to avoid running over the flocks of women who stumble on to roads. ‘They are like children. They have to be guided by men. None of them speak. It’s like the Middle Ages.’I felt scared, vulnerable.I walked to the kiosk to buy coffee. ‘Mumble mumble,’ I said to the young man serving. To his credit – the station is in a rural area, so I’m sure this was the first time he had encountered a full veil – he didn’t bat an eye, and smiled. I pointed. I automatically lifted the cup to my lips. Ah. How was I going to do this? I tried to work the cup up the inside of the cloth, performing an elaborate jig on the platform, but got stuck halfway.Later that day, at a coffee shop in Fulham, I sat outside at a table, faced with a sandwich and a latte. As I weighed up my hunger, an Arabic man shouted abuse at the white, male photographer sent to chronicle my day. I have no idea what he was saying – perhaps I shouldn’t have been eating in public – but the interesting point is that during the entire experiment, he was the only person who gave me any abuse.    Women wearing a burka, clothing that covers their entire bodies shopping at a bazaarThe only time I became furious at my treatment was when, for a domestic flight, I swanned through security unmolested, when normally I’m made to remove jacket and shoes. This smacked of PC pandering. I was heartened, though, that throughout my week I was only ever met with helping hands.Getting into a cab in London I was still called ‘darlin’ by the driver. Getting out of said cab, a passing decorator opened the door and grabbed my shopping – a burka makes you clumsy, slow, helpless I spent most of the week feeling like a disabled person.In fact, the only curious glances I attracted were from small children and my border collies, who started barking like maniacs.One day, I had lunch with a friend in Primrose Hill. She walked past my table three times. I waggled my Prada bag, which I thought she might recognise.‘How fantastic,’ she said when at last she realised it was me. ‘You don’t have to bother to put on make-up or wash your hair. How much spare time you must have!’ This was a common response from my much-groomed, often scantily-clad female friends.I admit, too, this rather jokey response had, as someone who never leaves the house without having had my roots retouched, crossed my mind. Aren’t we in the West equally imprisoned by the pressure to be perfect?But having worn my burka (it’s still upstairs in a box, like the ashes of a dead pet), I find that attitude naive. Telling women to cast it off, making a joke of how they appear, is disrespectful of those who are forced to wear what amounts to a mobile prison for fear of being beaten, or worse.You become not just not female, you become inhuman. All through my week I’d worn scent, something I never normally do, so compelling was the feeling I had to be feminine in some small way.I was supposed, during my sentence in purdah, to wear trainers so as not to expose ‘toe cleavage’, but I got so hot I resorted to flip flops: the steam had to escape somehow.          The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sandThe second most common response from Western women was that, thank goodness, at least men won’t leer. Well, this isn’t a problem I face daily. Yes, of course it’s helpful not to walk along dark alleys in a miniskirt and boob tube, but let’s not forget the extremely high incidence of rape in countries where the burka is prevalent. Extreme modesty does not breed safety.The ridiculous claim the burka protects women from male harassment was wheeled out yet again on Woman’s Hour. A British Muslim woman defended her ‘choice’ because not only did it bring her ‘closer to God’ but because ‘before I used to get men asking for my number, can they have dinner with me’.I’ve no idea what she looks like but to evoke that response she must be up there with Ava Gardner. She went on: ‘I’m not going to stop because people are ignorant. I have had so much abuse on the train.’Well, she has obviously never travelled with First Great Western. On my trips back and forth I found both passengers and staff courteous. At one point, after a particularly hot day in Regent’s Park, trying to lick a 99, I wobbled to the buffet car and mumbled for a G\u0026ampT. ‘Would you like ice with that?’ the young lady asked, deadpan.Rather than being the brunt of abuse, I felt that by wearing a veil I was the one being rude. I had to keep tucking my hair back, like Audrey Hepburn as she disappeared forever, married to Christ in The Nun’s Story, and started to wonder: what is so disgusting about the female form that it has to be hidden?On yet another perfect summer’s day in Hyde Park during my week covered up, I saw a crocodile of schoolchildren, aged maybe nine or ten. Several of the girls were in headscarves: only the small moon of their faces exposed. For the first time I knew how they were feeling: different. Hot. How about, too, marginalised, objectified, kept fresh only for the eyes of their male relatives?After just a few days, what I mostly felt was exhausted. I asked a young Muslim woman who lives Bristol how on earth she coped and she answered: ‘You just have to get used to it.’ I’d rather not, thanks very much. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/00/4F07D26C00000578-0-image-m-3_1534031085707.jpg","title":"Bruce Forsyths family want store ashes stage London Palladium","story":"Father of Love Island winner Jack Fincham is a convicted...The purrrrrrfect job!

With all but three having received their visas, on Sunday Qarmout was granted hers in a last-minute reprieve after applying three times since April.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have decided to issue a visa to Mrs Qarmout on the basis of new information that has been provided. We are working with her to ensure she receives her visa and travel documents as quickly as possible.”However, it is unlikely Qarmout will make it in time for her scheduled appearance on Wednesday, when she was due to speak at a sold-out event about her book, The Sea Cloak and Other Stories. As a Gaza resident, she also requires approval from Jordan to fly from Amman to the UK, as well as an exit permit from Israel to pass through the Erez Crossing on the border. She has been advised that it will take four to five days for her passport to arrive in Gaza.The festival’s director, Nick Barley, said a new event would be planned for 23 August in her honour. “If she can attend, it will be a celebration of freedom of speech,” he said. “If not, we’ll bring attention to her case.”Ra Page, the founder of Comma Press, Qarmout’s UK publisher, said: “Despite this last-minute reversal, the Home Office has effectively stopped Nayrouz from coming over, by not giving her the visa the last two times she applied, when there was still time. There’s no way she’ll be here on Wednesday, and it is not a guarantee that she’ll be here on the 23rd. Everything remains unknown and uncertain.”Page said he believed refusals were on the rise and that “internal directions have been issued to British consulates to reject more”.“It feels like we’re all sleepwalking into a new age of nativism,” he said. “We’re not just talking about classic, difficult-to-prove institutional racism. We’re talking about quiet, effective cultural censorship. The Home Office is saying, in effect: British readers shouldn’t be hearing from other perspectives at our book festivals their voices are of less worth British voices first.”Speaking before the decision, Qarmout said she had found the visa application process “intrusive” and that the reasons provided for her refusal – one Home Office letter listed her single status as a reason – were “humiliating”. She attributed irregular payments in her bank statements to bureaucratic problems between the competing authorities in Ramallah and Gaza. “I am supposed to explain myself in the context of the plight of all the Palestinians in order to apply for a visa? Even though I am travelling as a cultural ambassador of my people, it makes me uncomfortable ... I am not a terrorist and I am not a threat,” she said.Two Iranian illustrators, Ehsan Abdollahi and Marjan Vafaeian, are still awaiting updates for their visas a month after applying. Both have been informed by the Home Office that their applications had complications. Both have been denied visas to attend the festival before, with Abdollahi – who was supposed to be the festival’s annual illustrator in residence this year – eventually having his 2017 refusal overturned after a high-profile campaign.Delaram Ghanimifard, the co-founder of independent picture book publisher Tiny Owl, which publishes both Abdollahi and Vafaeian, said she felt embarrassed about the increasing refusals. “I know many Iranians applying to visit, some who are parents of British citizens, who are refused now. It is very difficult and it becomes more difficult each year. But when you have a publisher paying for everything, guaranteeing you will only stay a week and you’ve even done it before and returned home, yet you are still denied – this just shows how difficult the process is in general.”Ghanimifard said she believed many foreign authors had already given up on attending UK festivals because of the hurdles. “When you’re always under this stress applying for visas for your artists, you do start to feel there is no point,” she said. “I hope we can fight against it.

Some of us may not mourn him at all: a fate generally reserved for dictators.The reasons for turning away from Naipaul the writer are related to how his writing expressed his humanity – or lack of it. Naipaul’s discomfiting assertions – about Islam, about women, about countries less fortunate than the one he lived and died in (especially the Trinidad of his birth, Africa, and to some extent, India) – are often unjustified, unpleasant and untrue, though he insisted that, despite their unpleasantness, they possessed the unflinching quality of truth.I think this part of Naipaul’s contribution was overplayed, both by those who couldn’t abide him and by himself. His achievement has to be the writing itself: time will tell us if this true. Certainly, it won’t be possible to keep alive the idea of his gift for very long if he was just an agglomeration of blind spots and hostile prejudices. This is the paradox of literature, whose value lies in itself and not in the writer’s “views” (as WH Auden pointed out in his elegy to WB Yeats): none of Naipaul’s regrettable opinions will make the writing disappear, if it indeed possesses originality.Naipaul’s writerly achievements have taken a backseat for reasons I’ve mentioned but there’s another reason, which is so obvious that we aren’t conscious of it. Naipaul was not white. This means we must primarily view him as a representer – or misrepresenter – of the culture he came from, rather than as one who’s renewing language and radically rethinking the form he uses. After all, how can you renew something – in this case, the English language and the novel as a genre – which you don’t have cultural ownership of (the novel is seen to be a Western invention “adapted” to other milieus)? At most, you could admit Naipaul wrote impressively (the implication being that he wrote English unusually well for a non-white person). That his impact as a formal innovator was greater and more crucial than almost any of his contemporaries’ is something we’re just beginning to understand, because none of us as yet have the critical language with which to think of a brown man in that way especially a grandson of an indentured labourer.  If we were to look at two books that exemplify Naipaul’s achievement, they would be A House for Mr Biswas (1961) and The Enigma of Arrival (1987). Neither novel received any awards. Despite its occasionally difficult subject - the transformations and travails of Mr Biswas, a man of little means who was based on Naipaul’s father, and who marries into a powerful but crass Trinidadian family - Biswas expresses Naipaul’s astonishing capacity for joy. This joy, this buoyancy and love, animated his early works. It can be seen in the opening sentence of his first piece of writing, the stories in Miguel Street: “Every morning when he got up Hat would sit on the banister of his back verandah and shout across, ‘What happening there, Bogart?’” Immediately, we’re taken out of the sense of interiority we associate with the psychological novel. Naipaul was beholden to cinema, and his attention to the visual is evident in Biswas too, which contains an unusually compelling immediacy that is almost unthinkable for a novel of over 500 pages. Given its size, we think of Biswas as a proto-Victorian novel, but it isn’t one: its preoccupations are the moment-to-moment transformations of Biswas’s world, and his proneness to daydreaming. As a commentator, Naipaul excoriated, and was haunted by, the “half-made” (his assessment of West Indian society) as a novelist, the half-made – a sign being painted in Trinidad a ruined cottage in Wiltshire – excited him deeply. Despite Naipaul’s vision darkening with the political turmoil of 1970s Africa, I don’t think his deep and defining love of life ever vanished. In fact, I see the despair – the madness, almost – of some of the less tenable pronouncements to not be just a denial of love, but inextricable from it. This love lights up The Enigma of Arrival, Naipaul’s novel set in rural Wiltshire (where he himself lived), but it is also a work of revelatory self-reflexivity. Few writers have dwelt on the strange contingency that writing entails with as much as richness as Naipaul did – first in the short Finding the Centre, then most powerfully in this book. The Enigma of Arrival is, besides being a novel, an essay enquiring into writing and living, and into what comprises the line that ostensibly ides the two. By 1987, that iding line was wavering for Naipaul, and proving increasingly irrelevant and cumbersome. And so he departed the realist novel for what was at first mistaken by some for a proto-memoir. The Enigma of Arrival appeared at an odd and, for it, isolating time, when postcolonial studies and the epic Indian novel in English were in full swing, and some years before WG Sebald’s formally hybrid works, dealing with similar questions (but in his case legitimately so, since he was European), made their appearance. It’s clear now, though, that many younger writers then, who were bored of realism and magic realism, and categories such as “autobiography” and “fiction” – I’m thinking of myself, certainly, but also of Deborah Levy, Teju Cole, Caryl Phillips, and Karl Ove Knausgaard, among others – had silently registered the impact of this anomalous book.Though many of us disagree fundamentally with his views, we are beholden to what Naipaul has given us: not as members of a particular ethnicity, group, or gender, but as people, whose experience of the world flows into the experience of writing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle.

Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

It is the only way forward in the this polarised ageI got called “viper-tongued” by a total stranger on the internet the other day, which is quite something. I looked to see if I had defrauded any indigenous people of their lands, but I hadn’t. I’m not even sure what it was in connection with. Doesn’t matter, I suppose it’s just nice to check in with the fans.The way we talk to each other online has got a bit … fruity, hasn’t it? People bewail the coarsening of public debate a bad development with a pleasantly granular overtone, as if we’re discussing mustard. We know the internet’s anonymity emboldens people, and it is easy to glide into the assumption that people are therefore inherently bad. If you watch rolling-news banners, they all seem to confirm it. People are just bad. Outrage yesterday as one group is screwed over by another. The price of Freddos is going up, because people are bad. Why are you even watching this? You’re probably bad too.I don’t like to think people are bad, because I will throw myself down a well if that is true. So, I’ve been cultivating a taste for debate podcasts that air personal disagreements in the healthiest of ways. There is a new series of Across the Red Line on Radio 4, in which people who take opposite positions on a political issue try (and often fail) to calmly unearth the exact point at which their beliefs erge, and why. The Sacred Podcast is an interview series in which people of faith, agnostics and atheists air wildly incompatible beliefs on the Big Questions, such as whether there is any God or meaning to life, and is excellent for renewing your sense of plurality. Most rewarding of all though, is Conversations with People Who Hate Me: a mediated phone call between someone who has posted something abusive online, and the target of that abuse. Personal contexts are stated, respect and ground given by both, apologies made where necessary, friendship bracelets woven. It is affirming and addictive. Also, it turns out that people drunk-type a lot. I get something close to high listening to opponents being civil, disagreeing with decency and humour. “Find that common ground, Daddy!” I’ll gurn with disproportionate satisfaction. “Actively listen to each other, nnnngh!”The feline host, Dylan Marron, is eloquent, unoffendable, and happy to educate and learn. He always sees the best in his guests, and is my hero. (Marron is not to be confused with Dylan Moran, the drunk comedian who eats coasters as if they’re biscuits, although he is up there, too.)There is a self-selecting bias to guests who agree to feature on these shows, but that doesn’t invalidate what we can learn from them. Most people act according to their values, which they see as positive, even if their expression of them is occasionally the opposite. Of course, it’s naive to think every situation can be met with reasonableness, like shouting after a mugger: “Obviously take the wallet, but would you mind leaving my keys?” The small minority of people who incite hate or violence aren’t owed a platform. But most people will respond to their humanity being respected, and reciprocate. Listening to those we disagree with is the only way out of our toxic political moment, the only way we can inch forward. Faith in people is the basis of activism, not the enemy of it.I’m always looking for more recommendations, if anyone has them. In the meantime, I’m off to bask and forage, find a spot to hibernate in. Maybe even – and I’m sorry about this – snack on a mouse. Us vipers are only trying to get by, you know.Murky news from the Netherlands. The Amsterdam ombudsman recently declared that the Dutch city “becomes an urban jungle at night, where criminal money is leading and authority no longer exists”. I didn’t know Amsterdam had an ombudsman, certainly not one who talks like he is delivering the opening monologue to a Batman film. Honestly, he sounds like Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle, a man who would definitely have made his views known in the comments section, if they had been invented.A hero has stepped in to clean up: the government. All four main political parties have come together to oppose what they see as the problem – certain tourists and the “Disneyfication” of the Dutch capital. Amsterdam attracts nearly 18 million visitors a year, not all of whom are drawn to the hump-bridged canals, the historic botanical garden and Calvinist character of Dutch civic life. The problem they are trying to address is the number of stag parties the city attracts, so I’m not sure to which Disney films they are referring. Sex Toy Story? Pinocchiococaine? Aladdin a Bin? Maybe they dub them for a Dutch audience.As of this month, the city can close down streets in the red-light district to implement cleaning breaks, take care of vomit and rubbish left by tourists, and enforce on-the-spot fines for public drinking, urination and disorderliness. Which is many British men’s definition of a stag do. As a staunch, lifelong loather of stags, I’m extremely taken with this picture: gangs of absolute legends being drawn to the city of legalised prostitution and decriminalised cannabis, to discover they are the ones being cracked down on. Obviously, I’m too spiritually pure to ask for a real rain that can wash all this scum off the streets, but municipal employees armed with sick-hoses and side-eye are a good compromise.A few days ago, Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe, which will “touch the sun”, as it flies within 4 million miles of the unreasonably hot star. I’m not being funny, but that’s not really touching the sun, is it? That’s like me saying I’ve touched Roger Federer because I once passed through Wimbledon tube station. Engineers spent a decade creating an advanced heat shield to deflect the sun’s energy to stop the probe melting. Yet where were they when I needed exactly the same thing a week ago?

But his petulant foreign policy should set alarm bells ringingWhen western media and the\u0026nbsppunditocracy fawn over\u0026nbspan Arab political figure who is superficially liberal but fundamentally still quite a nasty piece of work, it’s never long before they are spectacularly disappointed. I call this Desert Rose syndrome, after a 2012 Vogue profile that chose to flatteringly portray Asma al-Assad as first lady of a “wildly democratic” household, in a country that was the “safest in the Middle East”, just as Bashar al-Assad began to intensify a crackdown against his own people.The latest to provoke Desert Rose syndrome is Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto head of government of Saudi Arabia. His western-friendly mien has won him many admirers, but they will have been pulled up short last week after the country cut all ties with Canada over a tweet.It wasn’t even a particularly dramatic tweet. Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, addressed the cases of two siblings, Raif Badawi, a blogger who has been imprisoned since 2012 for “insulting Islam through electronic channels”, and his sister, Samar Badawi, a women’s rights activist. Freeland said: “Very alarmed to learn that Samar Badawi, Raif Badawi’s sister, has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. Canada stands together with the Badawi family in this difficult time, and we continue to strongly call for the release of both Raif and Samar Badawi.” The Canadian foreign ministry followed up, calling for the release of “all peaceful #humanrights activists” held by Saudi Arabia.Bizarrely, all hell broke loose. Saudi Arabia responded\u0026nbspby expelling the Canadian ambassador, recalling its own, suspending Saudi Airways flights to Toronto, and ordering thousands of state-funded Saudi students at Canadian universities to leave their courses and continue them elsewhere. The Saudi foreign ministry stated via Twitter that “The Canadian position is an overt and blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of #SaudiArabia and is in contravention of the most basic international norms and all the charters governing relations between States.” Further, it issued a warning: “Any further step from the Canadian side in that direction will be considered as acknowledgment of our right to interfere in the Canadian domestic affairs.”The word overreaction doesn’t even begin to cover it. It was a tweet. And it’s Canada. This isn’t even new territory for Saudi Arabia: up until now there has been a broadly agreed-upon protocol governing how Saudi Arabia’s allies criticise the country (rarely, mildly and with no threat of action), and how Saudi Arabia reacts (rarely, mildly and with no threat of action). That is how the face-saving calculus works. But something has thrown it off kilter, and dangerously so.The culprit is Bin Salman, a man who strives for status and is easily slighted. He is far from being the modernising prince that the New York Times, in its own badly timed Vogue moment, described as leading Saudi Arabia’s Arab spring “from the top down”. Every signature campaign Bin Salman has launched has ended up in a quagmire. The war in Yemen continues to claim civilian lives and taint Saudi Arabia’s international reputation. The blockade of Qatar, a petty and intense affair, is now more than a year old, a year in which the Qatari economy has continued to grow. By contrast, in June, it was reported Saudi Arabia had suffered a shock collapse in inward investment. Bin Salman even managed to botch his best hand, the end of the ban on women driving. The good PR evaporated when several women activists were arrested a few days before it took effect.And, of course, there is Trump. There is always Trump. Saudi Arabia’s increasingly erratic behaviour cannot be orced from the broader suspension of diplomatic etiquette. Trump praises, encourages and is generally in thrall to dictators who scare their people and don’t have to deal with the limitations of democracy. (And, of course, he has picked his own fight with Canada.) Pugnaciousness and wars of fake news between erstwhile allies are now de rigueur. According to the Saudi press, Canada has no moral high ground from which to judge Saudi Arabia because it oppresses the good people of Quebec, and is holding the public figure Jordan Peterson as a prisoner of conscience. There are fewer and fewer adults in the room.Saudi Arabia had always been indulged by the west for its ability to provide lucrative arms deals and other injections of cash. But now it seems to be acting with an\u0026nbspenhanced sense of entitlement, demanding that even\u0026nbspcosmetic expressions of concern about human rights cease. Under Mohammed bin Salman, the country has so far been involved in spats with Canada, Germany and Sweden, and embroiled itself in conflict with Yemen, Qatar and Lebanon. There is no “top-down” Arab spring here. Just a taste of what volatile princes, humoured by a gullible west, are capable of in a world where the old rules no longer apply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84c99a16f74dd7223d13f66fb37f92b6e392d8c6/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd7fe7e02e7ab90c4a5829a2870b0fa6","title":"idris elba appears to dismiss james bond rumours on twitter","story":"Actor tweets ‘don’t believe the hype’ as another slew of stories links him to the film franchiseIdris Elba appears to have mocked continued rumours he is in line to take over as the star of the James Bond franchise, following the latest round of media speculation linking him to the role.“My name’s Elba, Idris Elba,” the British actor tweeted on Sunday, after his name was once again linked to the role of 007.Five hours later, he posted an image of Public Enemy, then tweeted “don’t believe the HYPE”, also the name of one of the rap group’s biggest hits. Elba’s name has been linked to the Bond franchise for almost a decade, during which time Daniel Craig has starred in three films in the series. The latest round of speculation appears to have begun with a report in the Daily Star last week.It quoted the director Antoine Fuqua recalling a chat with the longtime Bond producer Barbara Broccoli, who allegedly said “it is time” for an minority ethnic actor to star as 007 and that “it will happen eventually”. The story went on to quote Fuqua as saying that Elba could be a candidate to take over.The story was swiftly followed up by news outlets around the world, despite Fuqua’s agent insisting that the conversation with Broccoli about the future of the Bond franchise never took place and is all “made-up stuff”. The online version of the Daily Star’s story includes multiple promotions for Fuqua’s new business, selling headphones that can be worn in the cinema in order to provide a surround-sound experience.Craig, 50, took over from Pierce Brosnan in 2005. He is signed on to play the character in the 25th Bond film, which is due out in late 2019 and will be directed by Danny Boyle.Elba, 45, has previously dismissed rumours and said he had not had any discussions with the studio about taking over the role. In 2016, he told Good Morning America: “I think I’m too old for that.”“I keep saying if it were to happen it would be the will of a nation because there haven’t been any talks between me and the studio about any of that,” he said. “Running around in cars and ladies and martinis, who wants to do that?

About two-thirds of them organise grouse shooting.The Moorland Association, which represents landowners, denied that they were being given an easy ride by the government.As the “Glorious Twelfth” – the start of the annual grouse-shooting season – begins on Sunday, Who Owns England is publishing a map of the owners of about 100 grouse moor estates in England. It estimates that the estates together cover half a million acres – an area the size of Greater London.A mixture of aristocrats, City financiers and businesses based in offshore tax havens own the estates, charging clients significant sums of money to bag grouse, according to its analysis.Environmental campaigners argue that the management of the estates harms the environment and wildlife. They say it leads to the illegal killing of birds of prey such as hen harriers, which prey on grouse, and the legal killing of foxes, stoats and mountain hares.One criticism concerns the practice of burning the bog to encourage new heather shoots – a food source for grouse. They say that burning heather leaves bare peat exposed to the air, harming wildlife that lives in the peatland.“Burning blanket bog to support the elite sport of grouse shooting wreaks ecological havoc – exacerbating wildfires and floods, and releasing huge amounts of soil carbon,” said Shrubsole.However, the accusations are rejected by the owners, who say their management of the moors protects the environment. They say that about two-thirds of England’s upland sites of special scientific interest are managed grouse moors which helps to conserve the landscape, while other areas have been lost to afforestation, windfarms or overgrazing.The documents record how Gove invited the landowners to a meeting in London in February.According to the minutes, Gove told them that he was pursuing a new policy, with the agreement of the European commission, and was looking to the landowners “to sign up to a voluntary commitment to suspend the practice of rotational burning with immediate effect”.“He advised that protecting soils was high on the government’s agenda and introducing an immediate ban on rotational burning on blanket bog could have significant consequence on land management practices currently underway,” say the minutes.Defra confirmed “the voluntary commitment is not a legally binding document and would show intent from both the government and land managers to achieve long-term outcomes for restoring blanket bog”.It added that unless “a significant number” of voluntary commitments were in place by next year, it would “need to introduce legislation to cease rotational burning”.Among those at the meeting was the Duke of Northumberland, who has donated £11,100 to the Conservative party.A Defra spokesperson said: “Protecting blanket bogs is a priority. We have made rapid progress over the last six months – 157 landowners have committed to cease rotational burning, up from three a year ago, representing the vast majority of blanket bog in England.“However the environment secretary has made clear that we will take steps to introduce legislation if our constructive, voluntary approach does not deliver.”It added that its advisory body, Natural England, was working closely with these landowners to put management plans in place as soon as possible.Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said: “The portrayal of the partnership agreement between Natural England and grouse moor managers as being ‘cosy and letting landowners off’ is completely inaccurate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16941ceef798e5ed2cdbe3ab9c5311483972354d/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b61084d38fd5238fa64fb4a0eb1bfa6c","title":"desiree akhavan miseducation of cameron post mainstream queer female stories","story":"The USIranian film-maker’s The Miseducation of Cameron Post won the grand jury prize at this year’s Sundance.

Plus, she makes you laugh. “I see where the funny lies and where the story is, and I chase the story wherever it leads me,” she told the New York Times recently.If you haven’t yet seen her work, she has two new pieces landing in August and September: her second feature film, The Miseducation of Cameron Post, which won the grand jury prize at Sundance film festival in January and a Channel 4 series, The Bisexual. Cameron Post is a moving chronicle of a teenage lesbian sent to gay conversion camp in the 1990s The Bisexual is a comedy about a contemporary gay woman who decides to date men. They’re very different, but both, at their heart, reveal how life can be when you’re young and don’t have an easy path within straight culture.Akhavan made a splash in 2014 with her first feature, Appropriate Behaviour, which saw her playing Shirin, a raw, self-obsessed, coulda-shoulda gay woman emerging from a live-in relationship. We followed Shirin around Brooklyn, New York, as she experimented with hookups (an excruciating threesome was a dubious highlight) and worried about hiding her sexuality from her Iranian family, and learned the story of her just-finished love affair. Appropriate Behaviour was explicit, hilarious and bang-up-to-the-minute. Comparisons were drawn with Lena Dunham (who cast Akhavan in Girls after seeing Appropriate Behaviour), and also with Akhavan’s own life. Born to parents who moved to New York following the Iranian revolution in 1979, she, too, is bisexual and found it hard to come out to her family. Still, it wouldn’t be right to view her work as documentary. “It’s my world,” she says, “but it’s not me.”Let’s begin with The Bisexual. Set in east London, where Akhavan now lives (“I felt my humour had a home in London. Also, I don’t know the hierarchies here. I’m sure they exist, but I don’t know them like I do in New York”), the cast includes Maxine Peake and Brendon Gleeson, and explores some of the same themes as Appropriate Behaviour. Akhavan plays Leila, who splits up with her girlfriend of 10 years (Peake) and starts dating men as well as women.“The elevator pitch was always: ‘What if a lesbian did the worst thing in the world a lesbian could do, and became interested in men?’” she says. “I wanted to write the show because I hated coming out as bisexual. I came out as that from the get-go, but that word always felt uncomfortable. Bisexual sounds gauche and tacky… Disingenuous. Whereas there’s only pride when I say lesbian, there’s only coolness to say queer. Bisexual didn’t feel like it represented me and I wanted to know why, when technically it very much represents who I am.”It’s not just about the label. Akhavan knows first-hand how the world changes when your partner does. “If I’m walking down the street with a woman, I’m a lesbian if I’m holding hands with a man, I’m straight,” she says. “And you see the world through that lens, and everyone treats you accordingly. Your lifestyle is completely different, the people you hang around with are different, and when you fight so hard to be openly gay, and claim that space – then having to reverse engineer it, and notice the world change around you, and the perspective change around you, that is a real head-fuck.”Akhavan describes a couple of scenes to me The Bisexual sounds funny. I can’t be sure, though, as the series isn’t finished when we meet so before we do, I email Maxine Peake. Peake, who seems to have had a great time on set, admires the way Akhavan made her co-writerdirectorlead actor multi-tasking seem “effortless”. “She always felt like a team member,” writes Peake.Akhavan is embarrassed when I read this out to her, even more so when I read Peake’s payoff line: “I appoint Desiree the new ambassador of cool.” Akhavan squirms because she’s not always been cool, by any means. Actually, she spent much of her younger life as a very uncool person. “Not even uncool. Just invisible,” she says. But before we get to that, we should consider The Miseducation of Cameron Post.Adapted from Emily M Danforth’s 2012 book, the film tells the tale of Cameron Post, played by Chlöe Grace Moretz, who’s outed as a lesbian when she’s caught by her male prom date making out with a girl. She’s immediately packed off to God’s Promise, a Christian teen camp, in order to be “cured” of her sexuality. The cure consists of living among other teens who feel SSA – same sex attraction – and who are, mostly, working hard to overcome this through talking therapy, physical exercise (“blessercise” workout videos), loving Gahd and having no contact with the outside world (Post has her Breeders cassette confiscated). It’s a funny and gut-wrenching film, with moments of poignancy and some excellent performances.Interestingly, for such an emotive subject, none of the characters are portrayed as completely evil. “I didn’t want it to be propaganda,” says Akhavan. “Though I think that would be a more commercially successful film. I wanted the tone to be right… Every film about teens is really about the moment they realise that none of the adults know what they’re doing.”On the surface, Cameron Post is a move away from Akhavan’s other work, less obviously tied to her own life experience. But when we talk about her background, it becomes clear that this film, too, is a way of her exploring her own past.Born in 1984 (she has one brother, who’s a paediatric urologist), Akhavan grew up in New York State, some distance from the upmarket Manhattan high school that she attended. Like many girls, she covered the wall of her room in magazine cutouts: “Pretty girls in pretty dresses, like a how-to guide on how to be a normal teenager.” But she wasn’t deemed normal – she was tall and overweight, with big feet – and school was tough. “I was the girl who made birthday cakes on your birthday,” she says, “that had tissues if you needed them. You know? The one that tried to kill people with niceness. Because niceness was all I had.”When she was 14, Akhavan received an anonymous email, with a website link. “There was a website for the hottest person at school,” she says, “and it was very popular, and the link was to the opposite, the ugliest person at school. I had 40-something votes, and everyone else had two or three.” She pauses. “That’ll shape you.” Her nickname at school was the Beast.She understands why she didn’t fit in – “there was one aesthetic, and it was: very thin, very petite, straight hair, straight nose, Petit Bateau T-shirt, 7 For All Mankind jeans, North Face fleece” – but these things take their toll. Still, she now thinks she was lucky: “I know those girls who fit in at that age, and it was through a sexual power that they couldn’t handle. Power is a really tricky thing, it’s overwhelming. If men had paid attention to me at that age, I would have gotten in trouble.”Back then, however, she had no self-comforting theories. She was unhappy. She made it through school, and then went to film school, where she spent most of her time being lonely, eating a lot and smoking weed. She sank all her energies into her graduation work, a short movie she shot in very expensive Super 16 film, then sent to 30 film festivals. It was rejected by all of them. By this time, she had full-on bulimia.“I was trying so hard and failing so miserably,” she says. “I’d got to the point where I had no idea if my graduation film was any good or not. I had no idea what my taste was… the same way I didn’t know if I was hungry or full, because I was making myself sick all the time.”So, aged 25, she went into rehab, at a place called the Renfrew Center in New York, where she was given a programme for eating (“diet, nutritionist, meal plan”), plus various forms of intense therapy. It was this time that she drew on for Cameron Post. “Really, it’s my film about rehab,” she says. “In rehab, there was always this question of: ‘OK, what if overeating is actually my personality? What if it’s part of me, the way my sexuality is?’ That became the question that I wanted to explore. We all wanted to be better, but what if we wanted to be better from something we could never get better from?”In the film, Akhavan identifies most with Cameron’s room-mate Erin (Emily Skeggs), a relentlessly upbeat girl who never stops trying to not be gay. “She really wants it to work,” she says. “That’s like me. I remember my first few weeks in rehab, and I was like: ‘What am I doing here, I hate every single person here, and I don’t want to listen to their problems.’ And then, as you stay a little longer, you realise that you’re staring at 12 different versions of yourself, and what you hate in them is everything you hate in yourself. That was something I wanted to make a film about, and I wasn’t ready to make a film about eating disorders.” When I wonder if there are any films about eating disorders, Akhavan points to Mike Leigh’s Life Is Sweet. “I love that film. That sequence where she binges and purges, it’s terrifying, and it’s exactly how it felt! No other film deals with it quite as horrifyingly.”In addition to going into rehab, Akhavan fell in love with a woman and came out to her parents. This was not easy. “No,” she says. “It’s just a really, really horrifying, shameful, awful thing to say. It took all the guts in the world to say it. And also, coming out as bisexual. I mean, everyone was heartbroken, and really worried. My family was like: ‘Well, if you could choose, why would you choose something that makes everyone so unhappy and that makes your life worse?’ And I understood their point.”Now, her family is completely supportive so much so that Akhavan’s dad worried that if she started dating men again, she might alienate her audience. Akhavan laughs about this. It’s almost impossible, when confronted with the confident, clever woman that she is today, to imagine that she blossomed from such a dark time.Which brings us to the inevitable Harvey Weinstein question. “I think it can only be good, what’s happening,” says Akhavan of the #MeToo movement. “I want people to be afraid and I want people to check their behaviour. I’ve had to. Not in a Weinstein way, but because I’m so direct on a shoot, I got feedback that how I talk could be seen as insulting. And I learned from that. I think you should learn, as an adult, how to be yourself, and not be aggressive to other people. It is totally good to have a healthy sense of awareness. There’s clearly something toxic in this industry, a place where women are paid a quarter of what the men are paid for the exact same job. Clearly there’s something diseased here. And now maybe we’ll see that the work won’t suffer because of this, that it will become exciting and erse and tell stories we haven’t heard before. The fact that the only mainstream queer female stories we’ve heard have been directed by men – that disgusts me.”She goes back to her rehab time, the six months that totally changed her. It is not as though she doesn’t still have problems, she says – “at all times in life, even when you reach success, the dust settles and there are new sets of problems, new identity crises” – but after that, “I was fearless. It wasn’t rebellion, it was just: ‘I want to make the calls. I want to do things on my terms, and I don’t want fear to drive anything I do.’ I truly became fearless. And that’s what the change was.”Not fitting in can feel terrible, but outsiders make the best art, I say. Akhavan thinks it’s more than that.“Before rehab, I had the feeling that I’d rather be dead than fat,” she says. “But then I started thinking: ‘What kind of power could I have as a woman who wasn’t beautiful?’ This is the superpower of the late bloomer. Time proves you wrong, and something that you think will handicap your life ends up becoming your superpower. All my handicaps became my superpowers.”The Miseducation of Cameron Post is in cinemas 7 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cae84476d72bce35ec9622d8fb8045c3d5ef410/0_228_5196_3118/master/5196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f36bd2c885a8a3b6112e90e6c477a256","title":"arsenal manchester city premier league match report","story":"If nothing else, Unai Emery can at least console himself that not every opponent in the Premier League will be as daunting as Manchester City. The fixture list was unkind to the new Arsenal manager and Pep Guardiola’s team duly continued where they left off last season, winning with something to spare and providing confirmation that it will require an exceptional effort from any other team to deny them another league title.By the time it was all done Emery had become the first Arsenal manager to lose his opening game since Terry Neill took charge of a team that went down 1-0 to Bristol City at Highbury in August 1976. It was the first time since 1936 that City have won back-to-back away matches against these opponents in the top ision and perhaps the most startling part, as far as the other title challengers are concerned, is that it was achieved with Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sané restricted to substitute roles, no place for Vincent Kompany or Nicolás Otamendi and David Silva working on his fitness back in Manchester. It is a frightening level of squad depth.For now at least Guardiola is going through his own period of experimentation. Bernardo Silva justified his selection with a peach of a goal and some brilliantly subtle link-up play. Raheem Sterling’s goal came from the left wing, rather than his usual position on the right, switching flanks so Riyad Mahrez could be accommodated. The fit-again Bernard Mendy was among the game’s outstanding performers and, on this evidence, City’s new central defensive partnership of John Stones and Aymeric Laporte will take some shifting.Guardiola’s side did not reach their most exhilarating peaks but it was still fairly convincing and the awkward truth, in these getting‑to‑know-you stages with Emery, is that it was difficult at times to understand what Arsène Wenger’s successor was thinking.Arsenal’s supporters will have known their new manager wanted to do things differently. What they perhaps could not have imagined was that he would start with Aaron Ramsey operating as a centre-forward, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the right of the front three and Mesut Özil in a much more withdrawn role than usual.Peter Cech\u0026nbspHis fine saves gave a level of respectability to the scoreline, for all that his distribution felt risky. 6Héctor Bellerín\u0026nbspThankless task as City overloaded on the wing. Like Guendouzi, was culpable at the opening goal. 6Sokratis\u0026nbspPapastathopoulos\u0026nbspCity darted at him, sniffing out space between centre-halves. The experience looked unnerving. Booked. 5\u0026nbspShkodran Mustafi\u0026nbspStill does not inspire confidence and carried a vague air of\u0026nbsppanic throughout the match. 5Ainsley M’land-Niles\u0026nbspTried desperately to quell Walker’s threat, before stumbling in a tangle of legs and retiring injured. 5Matteo Guendozi\u0026nbspWorked hard in a brutal contest first up. Early energy aside, he was steadily\u0026nbspoverrun. 5Granit Xhaka\u0026nbspThe more experienced midfielder was utterly unable to impose any kind of control on\u0026nbspmidfield. Booked. 4Aaron Ramsey\u0026nbspA bright start petered out, one smart turn into space aside, with his involvement peripheral. 4Mesut Özil\u0026nbspDrifted in and out of the fray, rarely threatening to dictate play. Still an\u0026nbspenigma. 5Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u0026nbspAnonymous for long periods when Arsenal needed more players breaking up City’s monopoly. 4Pierre-Emerick\u0026nbspAubameyang\u0026nbspIsolated and starved of sights of goal, and cut a frustrated figure until switched to the\u0026nbspleft. 5Ratings by Dominic FifieldEderson\u0026nbspBarely had a save to make so, some late sloppiness aside, enjoyed himself in possession instead. 6Kyle Walker\u0026nbspTore up and down the\u0026nbspflank at will, all pace and power to stretch panicked opponents. 8John Stones\u0026nbspQuietly classy in City’s back-line, and as comfortable as ever on the ball. Taking his\u0026nbspchance. 7Aymeric Laporte\u0026nbspOccasionally discomforted defensively, but the Frenchman was never tested enough. 6Benjamin Mendy\u0026nbspThe defender was absolutely irresistible going forward, a force of nature making up for lost time. 8Fernandinho\u0026nbspSpiky and energetic at\u0026nbspthe base of midfield, breaking up Arsenal’s possession with glee. 7Ilkay Gündgogan\u0026nbspMeandered forward when City claimed the ball and was quietly efficient if unspectacular. 6Bernardo Silva\u0026nbspWonderful first‑time finish for City’s second, after a typically elusive dart off a defender, summed up his excellence. 8Raheem Sterling\u0026nbspExcellent from the outset with a fine strike completing a half century of Premier League goals. 9Posed a different kind of threat from the flank, where he glided unnoticed into enemy territory 6Sergio Agüero\u0026nbspWill have cursed missing his one-on-one with Cech after Guendouzi’s mistake. Worked hard without reward. 6Ratings by Dominic FifieldÖzil had swapped positions with Henrikh Mkhitaryan before half-time and, 10 minutes into the second half, Emery decided it was time to put an orthodox striker, Alexandre Lacazette, in Ramsey’s position. Other changes followed, yet none had any real effect. It all felt rather chaotic and jumbled and it was tempting to wonder whether the crowd would have been so understanding if Wenger had been responsible for these tactics. A new manager always gets a bit of leeway and, in this case, that is just as well.At least Emery will have a better idea now why these sides were separated by 37 points last season and of the shortcomings in his side’s defence. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi frequently looked vulnerable as Arsenal’s new centre-back pairing. Héctor Bellerín found Sterling a difficult opponent and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, deputising for Nacho Monreal at left-back, lasted only 35 minutes before picking up an injury of his own. That meant Stephan Lichtsteiner, a right-back by trade, coming off the bench to join an experimental back line. Emery will need time to achieve a more settled dynamic.In the meantime he will have to analyse whether it might be time to ease Petr Cech out of the team. Cech did produce a splendid save in the second half to deny Sergio Agüero in a one-on-one breakaway but the Arsenal No 1 was also badly at fault for the opening goal and, not for the first time, there was clear evidence that he is no longer the goalkeeper he once was. Bernd Leno joined the club from Bayer\u0026nbspLeverkusen in the summer because of that exact point and, unfortunately for Cech, these are not new concerns.The only possible mitigation for Sterling’s goal, 14 minutes in, was that Cech was slightly unsighted as the City attacker, cutting in from the left, eluded a couple of wishy-washy challenges and fired a right-foot shot through a congested penalty area.The ball was near enough to Cech to be saved but his reflexes were poor and there was an even more startling moment, midway through the first half, when a pass was played back to the goalkeeper and he tried to switch play to the right, got it horribly wrong and nearly put the ball in his own net.Cech was lucky to get away with conceding a corner, rather than scoring a comedic own-goal, and on the next occasion he found one of his teammates there were ironic cheers. Much more of this and Emery will surely have to conclude it is time for Leno to get a chance. Arsenal’s next game is at Chelsea, Cech’s former club, and it will be intriguing to see what the new manager decides.In all it was not a hugely encouraging start to the post-Wenger era at Arsenal and Mattéo Guendouzi, a 19-year-old central midfielder, found out the hard way that playing against City is a lot different from turning out for Lorient in the French second ision.Guendouzi did show some neat touches but he and Bellerín were guilty of losing Sterling before the opening goal and it was the teenager’s mistake that let Agüero run free later in the match. Cech saved that one but in City’s next attack Mendy exchanged passes with Sterling before sending over a low cross from the left. Silva swivelled to strike the ball first time and send an elegant, left-footed shot into the top corner. The ball was still rising as it hit the net and City will take some stopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19709d2bd55f242e3e8316acff2b937126dce0ec/9_79_4277_2567/master/4277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9239471952a1ab4bcba012e5602664d","title":"pep guardiola manchester city count on raheem sterling","story":"Pep Guardiola has underlined his desire to keep Raheem Sterling at Manchester City, despite talks over a new contract remaining on hold, after the England forward excelled to ruin Unai Emery’s first Premier League game in charge of Arsenal.Sterling’s representatives had opened talks on a new deal before the World Cup finals this summer, the player having enjoyed an eye‑catching season in scoring 18 league goals to help City secure the title, only to postpone those discussions before the tournament.The forward earns around £170,000 a week on a contract that expires in 2020 and while talks over improved terms have yet to resume with the player apparently seeking nearer £300,000 a week, Guardiola has made clear his desire that an agreement can be reached with the\u0026nbsp23-year-old.The England forward was outstanding despite having been back in training for less than a week after his exertions in Russia and scored the opening goal as Arsenal, under new management, were swept aside at the Emirates. “For the record, I’m not a sports director, not even a manager. I’m a trainer,” Guardiola said. “I\u0026nbsptry to make a good team spirit in the locker room and win games. But we are delighted with him and would like Raheem to stay. We’ll do our effort to make him feel we count on him. And we do count on him.“People only judge players on the goals they score at the World Cup, but Raheem has this special relation with English football, he’s so loved in the locker room. He did some very good things in the World Cup, moving well and creating space for others. He’d liked to have scored a goal and he tried to, but I’m sure in the European qualifiers he will score goals for his country.“He trained just one week but we needed him today, and he did so well except when he was very tired at the end. His mum and dad gave him a special body shape: he’s small, tiny, so these kind of guys in one week are ready.”While Guardiola suggested this fixture, with Arsenal keen to impress under Emery’s stewardship, had been “complicated”, his side’s relatively comfortable victory served early notice of their intent to retain their Premier League title. Bernardo Silva added a second goal just after the hour and the host side, whose approach was rather chaotic at times, ended up well beaten. There was an admission post-match from Emery that it will take time for his team, who finished 37 points adrift of the top last term, to bridge the gap to the champions.“Manchester City’s performance showed us we have to continue our process to improve,” the Spaniard said. “They deserved this result. Today was very hard. City demanded our best performance, but we saw we have to work. We know this was only the first step in the process. City have been working for two years with Guardiola, building a team with good players and great stability, playing the way they want. And we are just starting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09865bfca6a3916215098e2d1e17d1eac72647e7/0_103_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ebb0ea1a3d59d5f7453aad53c2822c","title":"the big premier league preview football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and John Brewin for Football Weekly’s bumper preview of the 2018-19 Premier League seasonRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

A group of young men stub out cigarettes and pause conversation, squinting as they pull their shirts up over their mouths and noses. An elderly woman shuffles along the road towards me. She meets my eye then nods up to the haze above, a brown-grey cloud masking the normally Pacific-blue sky. This is Ambae, one of 83 islands comprising Vanuatu. The island is home to Monaro Voui, an active volcano that has sent plumes of thick smoke and ash into the air over the past 11 months, prompting a complete evacuation of the island last September. Residents returned a month later when the activity settled but the authorities have this month ordered another mandatory evacuation when monitoring revealed the chance of an eruption.The dust sneaks into fresh water supplies and covers gardens, reducing the quality and yield of food crops. It gathers on rooftops and changes the coastline appearance. Once rocky coastlines are now black sand beaches, an ominous symbol of the volcano’s power and energy.In April, villagers from high up on the volcano descended the mountain to sea-level evacuation centres inside church buildings and schools. Last month, the ash blocked out the sun completely, sending residents scrambling for torches in the middle of the day.The government’s evacuation notice means residents have to relocate within a week to nearby Maewo, providing incentives such as free transport, food contributions and health services. But many prefer to go to Santo, Vanuatu’s second-biggest island. Maewo is still at risk of ashfall, some tell me. Others admit Santo presents better opportunities for earning a living and the opportunity to be closer to family.I’m in Lonae, West Ambae where families are packing up their belongings for a second time in a year. As dawn breaks, small piles of boxes and belongings slowly appear on the beach and by 10am, a large crowd has gathered. This group has decided to go to Santo and word has it a ship funded by the Mormon church is due to arrive. The mood doesn’t feel exactly sombre. A young man plays guitar while children laugh and play on the sand. It’s clear the evacuation is considered a temporary measure for many.Eventually the ship arrives, anchoring two hundred metres offshore, and a small boat begins the cycle of trips back and forth. The disabled, sick and elderly board first. Women and children second. Finally, on perhaps the tenth trip, men board the boat. A dog swims furiously, chasing its owner, but eventually gives up and circles back to land.The scene is duplicated on East Ambae the following day, this time with a much larger ship headed to Maewo and officiated by a local policeman. I end up on the boat and this time the mood is tense. The evacuees cast their eyes back toward Ambae as we pull away from the island, uncertain what lies ahead and what will happen to the homes they have left behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c74421697c5223e99abb54a0c65cabbeb9653c/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1152942205ddecd2a96045b9fb13cf1","title":"win a weekend away at a premier inn anywhere in the uk and ireland","story":"Enter this prize draw for your chance to head to the UK destination of your choice with accommodation courtesy of Premier InnWhether you’re a family hoping to explore somewhere new and different, or friends seeking somewhere off the beaten track, if you’re the lucky winner you can choose a destination from over 750 hotels across the UK and Ireland.You’ll be able to enjoy the soundest sleep on luxury Hypnos beds, a seriously tasty all-you-can-eat breakfast and a delicious dinner at our restaurant.

A new constituency-by-constituency model by data scientists at Focaldata, which uses new YouGov polling, has found that 14 Welsh constituencies swung from Leave to Remain this year, putting Wales firmly in the pro-EU camp.In a cafe near the market, Geraint Davies, the passionately pro-EU Labour MP for Swansea West, puts the dramatic swing down to voters’ frustrations with the tortuous negotiations, and a growing realisation that the tempting promises about inward investment and jobs will come to little in the end.“People voted to leave the EU on the promise of more money for the NHS from the membership fee, access to markets and more trading opportunities, and taking back control of our borders,” he says. “People are now realising that a lot of those promises won’t be delivered.”Davies also points to a growing feeling that Swansea is losing out rather than benefiting from Brexit. Recent plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay to generate renewable power and proposals to electrify the rail line between Cardiff and Swansea have both been dropped by the government.“The overall amount of capital expenditure is being constrained because we have to pay a €40bn orce bill for leaving the EU. People are beginning to see that some of the big promises about investment are evaporating, and that is feeding into this feeling that we are being left out in the cold again,” he says.The city’s Brexit voters are increasing bewildered and disillusioned. Rachel Jones, who has been selling sweets from the family stall in the market for seven years, is so fed up with the uncertainty she says she wouldn’t bother to vote if she got the chance again.She says she wanted to register a protest vote by putting her cross in the Leave box: “Swansea is having a really hard time at the moment. If you walk around you just see boarded-up businesses and charity shops.” But she says that now uncertainty around Brexit risks the very future of the market. “People are frightened to spend money. Things have gone up in price but wages haven’t gone up. None of us knows what is going to happen.”Butcher Peter Mills, who voted Leave, says many people would vote differently given another chance. “I think the country would vote Remain now. Everybody is fed up – it’s gone on and on,” he says from behind his meat chiller. “I know a lot of money is coming from the EU, but whether we will have the money from Whitehall when we go out is another thing.”One of his customers, Mal Guard, who also voted Leave, says he wouldn’t vote again. “I probably wouldn’t bother because the government doesn’t listen to Joe Bloggs in the street. They listen to their own cronies and that’s it,” he says.Chris Lewis, the Swansea-born and bred Baptist minister who runs the food bank, says the city has never fully recovered from the decline of heavy industry in the 20th century. “It is a significantly deprived area. Regeneration hasn’t really replaced the industrial base that employed people in this area,” he says as a steady stream of people come in to pick up emergency food parcels.Lewis, who voted Remain, says many Leave voters were angry about the state of their community, which had been further impoverished by benefit cuts and austerity. “Some of it was a protest vote. They felt alienated by sort of every elitist, privileged government,” he says. “There was a degree of racism too – some people felt threatened by immigration.”But he believes Leavers are now switching sides as the reality of a Tory Brexit dawns on them. “Some of the people who voted as a protest have flipped. They think these posh idiots are leading us to disaster in a charge of the light brigade.”On the main shopping street in the east of Swansea, there is still considerable support for Brexit. Michelle Whitton, who works in an insurance call centre, says it is not going well but she would still vote the same way. “I’m glad I voted Leave, but whether we are going to get what we wanted I don’t know,” she says.But other Leave voters would choose differently now. Kaywan Ahmad, who is cutting a boy’s hair in a barber’s shop in Woodfield Street, says he feels as if he was tricked. “I read on Facebook that a vote for Leave was good for the NHS. But afterwards I realised it’s bad for the NHS,” he says. “I’d vote to stay if there was another vote.”Brexit has already hit his business. “I had about 12 Polish customers who used to work in Swansea. They would come every two weeks, but now they’ve gone back home,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff193edd9e847eb80a2ef7491e16b86f150ade02/469_0_1130_678/master/1130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8314ef2fedaf2cf9539e2f5d2c0aa506","title":"charities drop christine hamilton after post likening burqa to kkk costume","story":"Tweet by wife of former Tory MP Neil Hamilton comes during escalating row over Boris Johnson’s burqa remarksFollowing the criticism she received, Hamilton insisted her tweet had been misunderstood: “For heaven’s sake – no, I am not comparing Muslim women to KKK members and yes, thank you, I do know the difference. I was graphically illustrating how full facial cover can be sinister, which is how many people view the burqa.”However, members of the public had already contacted many of the charities she represented, prompting them to cut ties with her.Muscular Dystrophy UK said that it no longer felt able to maintain their relationship with Hamilton and added that “all links between her and the charity have been severed”.Balls to Cancer, which helps raise awareness of male cancer, said it was cutting ties after the “inappropriate tweet”, and added: “This tweet was on her personal account and in no way the opinions of Balls to Cancer. We would wholeheartedly like to thank her for her support and her work helping our charity into the public eye and helping save more lives.”Hamilton first came to public attention during the 1990s after the  revealed that her husband, the former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, had been paid by Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of the department store Harrods, to ask questions in parliament.The pair then transferred their infamy into successful media careers with a sideline in regular Christmas pantomime appearances.“Clearly I have offended people,” Hamilton said. “To avoid any embarrassment to the charities I named on my profile I have removed all reference to them.”Calls to the phone number she shared with her husband were not answered on Sunday afternoon.Neil Hamilton recently reappeared as a Ukip member of the Welsh assembly, despite living in an English mansion. He spent two years as the party’s leader in the Senedd, before being ousted in May amid complaints he had resisted suspending a member over an alleged racial slur made against the Labour MP Chuka Umunna.The comments came as the argument over Boris Johnson’s criticism of the burqa entered a second week, aided by a column in the Sunday  from his father, Stanley Johnson, urging him to go further. On Sunday afternoon Leo Johnson, another member of the family, urged his brother and father to stop talking about burqas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c50e04ff03451848e3a01772a5b223bb6913c911/194_176_3823_2293/master/3823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a74c5cb24aaf454e74d118ac1c043ca9","title":"advertise lives up to hype phoenix stakes martyn meade","story":"• Colt is first British-based runner to win the race for 21 years• Advertise justifies Meade’s confident pre-race commentsMartyn Meade was a relieved man after Advertise justified his extremely confident pre-race comments by landing the Phoenix Stakes at The Curragh. The colt became the first British-based runner to win the race for 21 years and most bookmakers trimmed his odds for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, though Skybet pushed him out to 14-1.Meade electrified discussion about the Phoenix last week by saying of Advertise: “It’s just a case of which race we want to go and win. We’ll beat Sergei Prokofiev again, so I wouldn’t be worried about him, and, to be quite frank, I wouldn’t worry about any of them.”That provoked some people on social media, where his words were described as “beyond arrogance”, and Meade accepted he may have gone too far as he reflected in the winner’s enclosure. “Some of the comments were a little bit over the top but, when you’ve got great confidence and exuberance about a horse, you do tend to get a little bit over the top,” the Manton trainer said. “Luckily he’s proved that those beliefs in him were right.”Advertise, whose only defeat was when second to Calyx at Royal Ascot, will now be given a break before an intended run in the Dewhurst in October. “He’s got a great temperament and he really wants to do it for you,” the winning jockey, Frankie Dettori, said.Tips by Chris CookAidan O’Brien appeared to have a fair hand for a race he had won 16 times but both Sergei Prokofiev and So Perfect undermined their chances by failing to settle in the early stages, though So Perfect kept on bravely to be beaten just half a length. O’Brien drew a blank on the Curragh card after his four runners in Chicago the night before were unplaced, suggesting his yard has not yet shaken off the effects of a virus.Meanwhile Alpha Centauri delivered her latest star performance with a comfortable win in Deauville’s Prix Jacques le Marois. Unbeaten in her last four, she could turn up next in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown next month. The Breeders’ Cup remains an end-of-year possibility, though her trainer, Jessica Harrington, suggested it was not a priority.“You hope she’s not burning up too much energy because there are several possibilities now,” Harrington said. “If she does make it through to the Breeders’ Cup, it will have been a very long season by then. I really want to see how she is before making a definite plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e68168a1dbfad5f5271dc19e3b00894fc2d4a1/0_21_4707_2824/master/4707.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f4c769886b27038b226e7a40e235dfa","title":"dina asher smith european championship third gold relay","story":"Sometimes athletics is a simple game. A bunch of people run around a track, and at the end Dina Asher-Smith wins another gold medal. On the final evening of these European championships, however, the 22-year-old looked desperately up against it with the British team fourth in the 4x100m as the baton was thumped in her hand. But then Asher-Smith applied the afterburners and, once again, the impossible suddenly became a glorious reality.First she torpedoed past a Swiss vest. Then a German one. And then she left the Netherlands’ Naomi Sedney for dead too before crossing the line in 41.88sec – the fastest time in the world this year.It was her third gold medal in Berlin, making her the first Briton to claim the treble at a major championships – although this time she also had three accomplices in Asha Philip, Imani-Lara Lansiquot and Bianca Williams.And how appropriate that history was made here, in the Olympiastadion, where Jesse Owens won four golds in 1936 and Usain Bolt broke the world 100m record in 2009. Her name now joins the ledger of legends.That victory, combined with gold medals for Laura Muir in the women’s 1500m and for the men’s 4x100m, helped Britain finish on 18 medals – topping the table with six golds – although Germany won one more medal.A glorious final evening started in golden fashion for Britain with Muir finally winning the first outdoor gold medal of her career after a daring strike for home from a long way out.The 25-year-old was a huge 1-7 favourite for the title, and with good reason: she held a five-second advantage over the rest of the field. Even so, it was still a surprise to see her kick for home after 500 metres, gradually extending her lead to win in 4:02.32sec. The Polish athlete Sofia Ennaoui was second in 4:03.08, with Britain’s Laura Weightman – who had earlier tried to chase down Muir – holding on for third.Afterwards Muir explained her decision to go early, saying: “I knew a lot of the girls have a good finish so I thought the longer I leave it the riskier it would be. I know I can run hard from a long way out, so I did that.”It meant that she became the first British woman to win European 1500m gold – even Kelly Holmes won only silver – and afterwards Muir said: “I hadn’t realised it before until my coach told me. To be the first British woman to win the title is a huge honour. It goes in the record books now. This was probably the most pressure I have been under but I have shown I can deliver at the top level and run well.”Weightman was delighted to claim bronze. “That last 200m was really hard, I had to get there as hard as I could, and hanging on for bronze, I’m delighted.”Another gold followed in the final event of the night as CJ Ujah, Zharnel Hughes, Adam Gemili and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey won the men’s 4x100m. Aikines-Aryeetey had to step in after Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake picked up a niggle in the semi-final, but had no problems racing to victory in 37.80sec, clear of the fast finishing Turkey, who took silver, with the Netherlands winning bronze.Elsewhere Eilish McColgan took a superb silver in a chaotic women’s 5,000m after the Israeli athlete Lonah Chemtai Salpeter stopped a lap early while in second. By the time Salpeter had realised her error she had been overtaken by McColgan and Turkey’s Yasemin Can. While the pair slugged it out for second, the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan raced clear to take gold in 14:46.12 – a new championship record.To make matters worse for Salpeter, she was then disqualified for stepping out of her lane at the start.This has been a championship where youngsters have made their mark and another star was born in the men’s pole vault as Armand Duplantis took gold with a huge clearance of 6.05m.In an electric competition, the 18-year-old from Sweden first soared over six metres and then 6.05m to win his first senior title. He had to fight all the way as the Russian Timur Morgunov also cleared six metres, while the former Olympic chairman Renaud Lavillenie 5.95m to take bronze.The crowd lapped it up, just as they had done all week. As Lavillenie told them at the finale: “This has been one of the best competitions ever, and for sure we want to come back.”Certainly this will go down as a brilliant and vibrant European championships, with the Olympiastadion attracting between 40,000 and 60,000 fans every night. They were rewarded with 19 home medals and several breakthrough performances, including one from the 17-year-old Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who became the first man to win the European 1500m and 5,000m double. But, for British eyes, this competition will always be remembered for Asher-Smith’s sustained brilliance. She has hit the highest notes throughout this week. And now, surely, the world awaits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fac26a2777cbb6169265bda7686a733ba650291/0_0_4097_2459/master/4097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16f6743c6cb59ba11601407cfe7be7e","title":"us pga championship 2018 day four live","story":"From the centre of the 12th fairway, Koepka and Scott pepper the flag. But it’s only Scott who can make his birdie putt, the leader pulling his gingerly to the left. This is too close to call now!A disappointed Thomas Pieters tries to end on a high, but his 40-foot birdie effort at 18 stops just short. It’s an excellent final-day 66, and he’s the new clubhouse leader at -10, but he’ll have trouble sleeping tonight after that capitulation on 17. Meanwhile at 13, Tiger rolls his birdie putt straight into the cup, raising his putter in celebration just before it drops. Shades of Jack Nicklaus on 17 at the 1986 Masters, in more ways than one!Tiger goes for broke at the par-three 13th. He lashes his iron straight at the flag back right, worrying not about the thick trouble a couple of yards to the right of the green. It’s a pearler, leaving an downhill ten-footer. Koepka and Scott split the fairway at 12. And wild scenes on 15, as Thomas leaves his second bunker shot 30 feet short ... then rolls in a putt that was pretty much a must-make in the circumstances. He’s salvaged his par, and pumps the air with a lusty COME ON! This is really heating up now!JT is threatening to unravel. He drives into the fairway bunker down the left of 15, and can only advance his ball into a greenside bunker on the same side of the hole. He’ll have a long third from there. Meanwhile Ian Poulter nearly drains a 40-footer across 18 for birdie. But it stops just short, and that’s a 70. He’s -5 for the week. And on 12, Gary Woodland nearly destroys the hole by coming close to a slam-dunk eagle with his second. His ball spins back ten feet, but once they’ve repaired the cup, he makes his birdie. And Tiger, who had gone close, makes no mistake with his birdie chance despite the long wait. That took nearly ten minutes a display of some mental strength there. Woodland rises to -9 Woods to -12, a couple off Koepka’s lead!It’s a sickening end to Thomas Pieters’ bid for the title. Having found the hazard with his drive, he finds it again as he tries to repair the damage with a heroic hoick greenwards. He ends up with a double-bogey seven, and he must feel like crying right now. Most folk have been making birdie on this hole: he’s effectively given three shots up to the field, right at the death. He slips to -10, when he’d have been dreaming of posting a clubhouse total to be reckoned with. Meanwhile JT yips another short one! This time he horseshoes one from a couple of feet at 14. He slips to -11. He can’t keep doing this. Pars for Koepka and Scott at 11 meanwhile.Stewart Cink never let it lie. After dropping shots at 4 and 5, that might have been it. But he’s birdied 7 and 12, and he’s going to make another at 13, sending his tee shot at the par-three 13th arrowing straight at the flag. It stops 18 inches short. The 2009 Open champion will move to -10! Meanwhile on 12, Tiger finds another fairway, then wedges to six feet! He’ll have a chance to grab a share of second.Koepka’s second into 10 takes a hot bounce off the green and dribbles into a bunker at the back. Scott, coming in from the other side, finds the heart of the green. He’ll have an uphill look at birdie from 20 feet. Tiger meanwhile overcooks a wedge into 11. He’s got a 30-foot birdie putt. And the thing travels all the way ... nearly, stopping half a dimple’s width short of dropping! There’s probably one microscopic blade of grass acting as bouncer. But there’s no repeat of the tease on the 16th at Augusta in 2005: the ball looks like it’s threatening to drop after hovering awhile, but it stubbornly stays put! There’s palpable disappointment in the crowd, who desperately want Tiger to land number 15 this week. But par it is. Still, it’s swings and roundabouts, because on 10, Koepka is one turn away from splashing into the cup for birdie. That one stays out too. Scott rakes in another long birdie effort, though, and this is really hotting up now!Up on 13, Thomas strokes his tee shot to 14 feet. He pulls his birdie putt to the left, and sends it four feet past, too. But he gets the one coming back for par, no repeat of the fiasco on 9. Meanwhile his playing partner Shane Lowry, having birdied 12, rattles in a 55-foot monster for a second birdie on the bounce! He’s -10 all of a sudden, as is the Open champ Francesco Molinari, who birdies 14! Yes, the 2018 PGA Championship has started now.Everyone’s reached the turn on Sunday, then. The 2018 PGA Championship starts now! The final pairing are on the 10th tee. Koepka sends his drive into the rough down the right Scott on the left. Meanwhile on 17, Pieters slices his drive into the hazard down the right. After all that good work!Thomas Pieters makes no mistake with his birdie putt on 16. Cool as you like, and richly deserved reward for that wonderful long iron. Tiger takes his two putts on 10 for par.Scott nearly curls in a big right-to-left breaker from 20 feet for birdie on 9. He turns in 34. Koepka meanwhile guides in his birdie putt, and he’s hitting the turn in 33. That’s three birdies in a row, and he’s in command of this tournament again. Some response to that two-hole wobble. JT has to salvage his par on 12, then ... and he does so, sending a low stinger from the trees just over the back of the green, then getting up and down very calmly. Meanwhile it’s a final-round 69 for erstwhile leader Dustin Johnson, who ends the week at -6.Tiger finally finds a fairway, crashing his ball down the middle of 10. He’s left with an 8-iron in. He finds the middle of the green, but he’s not particularly close. Back on 9, Koepka wedges from the fairway bunker to ten feet, a glorious shot to set up another birdie chance. And there’ll be a look at birdie for Pieters on the par-three 16th, as he clips a stunning 4-iron pin high to 12 feet.This is sensational, isn’t it. Yes. Yes it is. “Sergio’s just chipped in at 15! But then Cink follows him in!! Monty’s looking good too. And what a putt from Woods on 16. Oh, sorry, I’m watching the 2006 Ryder Cup on Sky. Thank goodness for the HBH.” Simon McMahon, president of the Eleven Sports fan club, there.Adam Scott birdied 8 as well. Meanwhile Thomas Pieters rolls in another medium-range putt for birdie at 15. Brooks Koepka sends his drive at 9 into the bunker to the left of the fairway. And JT flays another wild drive into Puntersville, this time down the right of 12. He’s in the thicket, up where Jordan Spieth’s title bid effectively ended yesterday afternoon. Pro tip: don’t take a hybrid and try to lash through a small gap, in case your ball cannons off a tree and out of bounds.Tiger’s outrageous draw from the side of the cart path down the left of 9 landed 12 feet from the flag. In goes the putt, and that’s a really daft birdie. Not quite as silly as the one made by JT on 11: from the top of Injured Punter Mountain, he bumps a chip down the hill, over a path, back up a little ridge, and onto the green. And of course he makes the 10-footer he’d left himself! But as the pair move towards Brooks Koepka, the leader takes another step forward with birdie at 8. He was just off the green in two, in fact, and nearly chipped in for eagle. But he’s more than happy with what he’s got.Brooks Koepka is certainly in the box seat he’s on the par-five 8th in two. Nevertheless, good luck calling this championship with any certainty.Tiger takes an iron for safety on 9, and hooks it down a cart path on the left! I’m not sure he’s found a single fairway yet, and he’s just about to reach the turn. But it doesn’t seem to matter. He whips an iron into the heart of the green, an outrageous result from where he was. JT bounces back from his three-putt hell to birdie 10 ... then balloons his drive at 11 towards a mound of punters sitting on the left. His ball clanks off some poor guy’s head. The chap’s getting an ice-pack pressed to his noggin not sure where the reigning champ’s ball is. Meanwhile Shane Lowry pulls a miserable short par putt left of the cup at 10 he’s back to -8. The nerves kicking in there. But it’s two birdies in a row for Jon Rahm, the latest at 8, and he joins the folk at -10.Birdies for Koepka and Scott at 7. Scott’s was dependant on a 25-foot putt from the fringe Koepka’s was textbook, a perfect drive, wedge to eight feet, and a calm roll into the hole. In the meantime, Molinari can’t make his birdie putt on 11, while Pieters sends his second at 14 to 12 feet, and in goes the birdie putt: he’s in second place all of a sudden!A first birdie of the day for Jon Rahm at 7. He’s back to -9. There are a lot of players at -9. This is one crowded leader board. So Tiger gives it a little shoogle by splashing from the sand at 8 to 18 inches. He’ll move back to -10. Up on 18 meanwhile, Jordan Spieth can’t make the birdie that’d give him a share of the clubhouse lead. His 20-foot putt shaves the hole, and it’s a final-day 66. He ends the week at -8. This is what he can do when he’s not in form!Tiger’s blagged a good break down the left of 8. A lie on ground trampled down by the galleries, and a route through the trees to the green. He lashes a fairway wood into the big bunker front right of the dancefloor. That’s a decent result from where he was. Meanwhile up on 11, Molinari nearly spins his second back into the cup, though the ball keeps going another 12 feet. He’ll have a look at birdie, though.JT three-putts from eight feet on 9! A fine birdie chance turns into a bogey. His knees buckle in despair. And seconds later, Koepka rolls in his par putt to stop the bleeding! He’s now got the lead on his own. Meanwhile at 8, Tiger hits his drive straight left, into leafy bother. The pressures of major-championship Sunday can make even the greatest do some very odd things.Another birdie for Molinari! He smacks his second at the long par-four 10th to 12 feet, and carefully rolls the putt into the centre of the cup. Never missing, and Italy’s major champ is -9. Back on 9, Shane Lowry lifts his second to kick-in distance: he’ll be moving to -9 very soon. Par for Tiger on 7, a fine up and down from cabbage at the back of the green: he’s -9. And on 6, Koepka’s tee shot lands on the fringe at the back ... and he sends his putt eight feet past the hole. The next putt may well define his round.Francesco Molinari isn’t out of this yet! He’s just hit the turn in 34 strokes, having parred the opening eight holes and making birdie at 9. The Open champion is -8, just three off the lead. As is Players champ Webb Simpson: the 2012 US Open winner has just birdied 11. And Jordan Spieth fancies a piece of the action, should the leaders fall back later this afternoon: having gone out in 32, he’s just birdied 17 to join the group at -8. He’ll need to birdie the last to join Rafa and Tyrrell (that sounds like some sort of acid-jazz collective) in the clubhouse lead.Is the leader wobbling? Koepka drives into the rough down the right of 5, and is unable to power his second onto the green. He can’t get any spin from the thick rough, and his third bumbles 12 feet past the hole. He sends his putt on the right line - it’s sliding right-to-left - but he doesn’t hit it. Suddenly it’s a tie at the top! Koepka was five ahead at one point yesterday afternoon. Meanwhile pars for Cabrera Bello and Hatton. That’s a pair of 64s! They’re the new clubhouse leaders at -9! This leader board is quite superb.Thomas Pieters already had birdies at 1 and 8. He’s got a third now, at 11, chipping in from the fringe. He’s -9. Bogey for Rickie Fowler on 5, a three-putt after leaving his first long effort seriously short. And it’s bogey for Tiger at 6, as he overhits his sand shot. Happily not enough to find the water, but he is putting from the fringe on the other side of the green, and he can’t hole the 15-foot saver. He’s back to -9.Birdies at 13 and 14 for Chez Reavie: the 36-year-old from WichitaKoepka lags a lengthy birdie putt on 4 to four feet. He’s surely saved his par, but he pulls the short one and that’s shocked the gallery. It’s the first mistake he’s made with the flat stick for a good while. Bounce-back birdie for Rose at 13: he’s -8. Meanwhile birdie for Tyrrell Hatton at 17, after stiffing his wedge. Like his partner Rafa Cabrera Bello, he’s suddenly just three off the lead! Just look at this!JT rattles in a 18-footer on 7, his third birdie of the day. At -11 he’s just two off the lead of Koepka, who has found the heart of 4, but isn’t within realistic birdie range. Justin Rose is a dimple away from making a 30-foot par saver at 12, but he’s back to -7. Day tidies up for his bounce-back birdie at 6: he’s -9. And Tiger wasn’t in the bunker by the side of 5, but in thick rough instead. No matter: he bumps a glorious wedge to a couple of feet, and will escape with a par.Tiger’s in the woods, but has found a clearing within. He’s going for the green, over the one tree in his way with a 9-iron from 170 yards. He gives it a fierce lash, but can only find a bunker guarding the front of the green. He’s not miles from the flag, though there’s not loads of green to work with. Jason Day creams his tee shot at the par-three 6th straight at the flag, to four feet. And on 17, Rafa Cabrera Bello wedges his third to four feet: a birdie will take him in to a share of fourth at -9.Stewart Cink continues to go backwards: a missed tiddler for par at 5, from no more than 12 inches, and he’s -7. His playing partner Jason Day bogeys too he’s -8. And bogey for Jon Rahm at 4 he’s especially frustrated after missing three good birdie chances at the first three holes. Justin Thomas pushes his tee shot at the par-three 6th. He flirts with the water, but his ball gets over the drink and settles in a swale. With delicate hands, JT gently lobs his second to a couple of feet, and makes off with his par. He stays at -10. Justin Rose is putting a late, Hail Mary bid together: birdies at 7, 8 and 11 have catapulted him to -8. Bogey for Cink at 4 the 2009 Open champ is back where he started at -8. And on 5, Tiger flays a wild drive into the gallery down the right. He spins through 180 degrees on his heels, as though he can’t bear to look at what’s happened, beside himself with irritation.Tiger can only lay up from the sand to the side of the long par-four 4th. But he screeches his third six feet behind the flag, and will have a great chance of scrambling his par. He teases it straight into the centre of the cup, and the gallery celebrate as though he’d just made eagle. That’s a momentum-saver. But bogey for Woodland, who drifts to -8. Back on 3, Koepka pulls his tee shot a tad he’s found the heart of the green, but he’s a fair bit from the cup.Koepka leaves himself a dribbly downhill left-to-right par putt on 2. It’s never missing. He’s such a laid-back character. And he remains three in the lead at -13. Meanwhile Rory McIlroy finishes his week with a 70. He’s -2 overall, and it’s four years now without a major.Justin Thomas makes his second birdie of the day, following up the one at the 1st with another at 5. The reigning champion doesn’t fancy giving the Wanamaker Trophy back - maybe he’s misplaced it like Walter Hagen did back in the day (5.10pm) - and he’s joined Tiger in second spot at -10.It never quite happened for Tommy Fleetwood this week. The US Open runner-up shot 68 today, and ends the week at -4. See also: Russell Knox. A 68 today -4. Meanwhile Charl Schwartzel’s going the wrong way: bogeys at 1 and 4, and he slips back to -6. Bogey for Shane Lowry at 5 after a short putt dribbles past he’s -8. And it’s a par-par-par start for both Jon Rahm and Rickie Fowler.Koepka dices with the water down the left of 2. I think his ball’s snagged in the rough on the bank. He can breathe out again if so. Up on 4, Tiger sprays his drive into sand down the right of the track. Elsewhere, the erstwhile Masters and Open champ Zach Johnson is going very well. He was right in the mix after the first round, having shot 66, but slipped into neutral gear thereafter with rounds of 70 and 71. But he’s four under for his round today, and -7 overall. And Kevin Na continues to improve incrementally: 70, 69, 68 and he’s four under through 16 today. A couple of pars and that’ll be a 66. He’s -7 too.Tiger converts his birdie at 3: he’s -10. He really should have birdied all three of those opening holes, but a slightly conservative prod at his putt on the 1st allowed a pitchmark to kink his ball off to the left. Adam Scott bundles his chip at 1 to six feet, but that’s a nervy one for par to start. And he pushes it wide right. That flat stick’s going to let him down, isn’t it. Brooks Koepka meanwhile makes his birdie putt ... to somewhat muted cheers it has to be said. St Louis has waited for years to see Tiger in action he’s their man.Adam Scott’s opening tee shot was wild, sent under a tree down the left. He’s not able to punch-run his ball under overhanging branches and up to the green. Brooks Koepka however screeches a wedge to eight feet. He’ll have a look at birdie. Stewart Cink rolls in a 40-footer across 3 to reach -9. And on the par-three 3rd, Tiger will have a real look at birdie from kick-in distance, after pitching his tee shot 18 inches from the hole. It’s just as well that wasn’t a hole in one, because the noise would have shattered windows in Alaska."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0464732b7d870144560045428ed7f320be263af4/0_60_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=767da7488ac7495f986089a0cc68c634","title":"edinburgh fringe review natalie palamides ahir shah sam campbell","story":"Masculinity rather than #MeToo is a preoccupation this year, for male and female performers alike, along with race, nostalgia – and Harold WilsonWith more than 3,500 different fringe shows put on for hundreds of thousands of visitors during August, it’s little wonder that Edinburgh becomes discombobulating during its festival month. The streets turn into stages – even the few tiny pockets where there is respite from the chorus of acoustic guitars, children’s entertainers or men approximating EDM on a keyboard and a bucket. Everywhere has an accent of the surreal. There’s a man with a Boots carrier bag, but he’s dressed as Margaret Thatcher. There’s a group of restless teenagers lounging around, only they’re all wearing purple and green leotards for no clear reason. There’s the real Theresa May getting into a car, booed by the public, next to a box office where she is almost certainly not picking up tickets for Jonny Woo’s All Star Brexit Cabaret, even though she might find that less farcical than the fiasco she currently faces.There’s a cacophony of hard sells from the people with flyers – devoted, tenacious and unimaginably enthusiastic, there only for the love – who thrust leaflets into hands as they yell words seemingly flung together at random. In a metre or so of walking, enough to take only a few steps, I heard “trippy New Zealand stoner shit” and “comedy techno noir”, as if we’d all agreed only to speak in magnetic poetry. “Do you like dark comedy, and how social media keeps feeding you lies?” one woman asked, to which I’m still considering an answer.In the first week of August, the festival has barely begun and the buzziest shows are yet to be established. Talk about what’s a must-see is based on a quiet hum of rumour and potential that grows louder by the day, but at this stage your odds of stumbling into the best of the best rely on chance, taking a punt, and being in the right place at the right time. I was in the vicinity of Ahir Shah’s astonishing new show Duffer (Cabaret Voltaire) with a bit of time to kill one day, and joined the queue on a gentle tip and a whim. Shah’s show is free, so you pay what you like when it’s over, a bit like a late-era Radiohead album, with less techno noir. Shah’s set, a terrifically smart examination of family, religion and depression, is by turns furiously nihilistic and desperately warm and loving, and it wasn’t just the running gag about Bohemian Rhapsody that had me in tears at the end.It took Kieran Hodgson two years to turn an argument with his mum about their opposing Brexit views into ’75 (Pleasance Beneath), but it was worth the wait. Combining impressions of 1970s politicians with a deep e into Britain’s isive 1975 European Community membership referendum and a recurring question about shifting class allegiances might sound like a queasy combination, but Hodgson’s quick wit and passion for Harold Wilson’s vocal tics shone a new light on surprisingly relevant details of 70s Britain.One might have thought this would be the era of #MeToo-inspired material, but perhaps in the aftermath of Hannah Gadsby’s all-conquering and last-word-ish Nanette, most performers seem to have thought better of addressing it head-on. Masculinity crops up repeatedly though, chewed over and twisted into clever, questioning shapes by both men and women. Natalie Palamides’s Laid was a hit in 2017, but this year, at the Pleasance Beside, she is Nate, a rugged, unreconstructed kind of fella who forces the audience to ask themselves deeply unsettling questions about consent. It’s brutal, outrageous, next-level clowning, and made me extremely wary of the front row for the rest of my time at the fringe, if not for all eternity.I left Nate smelling cheap men’s shower gel in my hair, and walked straight over to Summerhall’s Square Go, in which one of the characters, Max, sprays Lynx around with abandon. The old cliche that comedy is a boys’ club may be on its way out, but for an early evening, it still smelled like one. Square Go is a cunningly sparse two-hander by Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair that soaks the audience in witty nostalgia as two teenagers prepare for a schoolyard scrap, cheered on and buoyed up by the crowd, until they start to ask why they can’t just talk, instead. The score is by members of Frightened Rabbit (whose singer Scott Hutchison recently died), which adds extra poignancy to an already touching production.Cora Bissett’s What Girls Are Made Of (Traverse) is nostalgia of a different flavour, a rowdy, rousing memoir-cum-gig about the reality of life as a 17-year-old girl in a hotly tipped indie band in the early 90s, and what comes after it inevitably falls apart. It’s effortlessly joyful, as is Bissett’s performance, and it has a gentle pop at Radiohead’s poshness that cannot fail to please.There’s a similar respect for the strength and power of teen-girl resilience in Rose Matefeo’s charming Horndog, at the Pleasance Above, which rips through growing up on the internet and argues, quite convincingly, that romcoms may be more damaging than porn.On my final night at the fringe, the buzz started to hum, loudly. A fear of missing Australian absurdist Sam Campbell’s The Trough dragged me to the Monkey Barrel at gone midnight. The place was packed with other comedians Campbell was, in this moment, the hottest of tickets. After a few days of tearing through theatre and standup, endurance-style, it’s easy to start to spot recurring themes: the NHS at 70 a sense of apology for being straight and white and male and dream catchers, oddly enough. To top it all off with Campbell, resistant to any category, theme, issue or otherwise, just scattergun hilarity, perfect nonsense, silliness for the sake of being silly, was a true delight.Alex Edelman: Just for Us (Pleasance Cabaret Bar)The one-time best newcomer returns with added maturity in this exquisitely crafted, deliciously funny story about a Jewish man who decides to hang out with some Nazis.Toast (Traverse)Nigel Slater’s memoirs have already been adapted for the small screen. Now they get a whimsical stage treatment, with added lemon meringue treats for the audience.Micky Overman: Role Model (Pleasance Bunker Two)Overman is Dutch with an Irish and Canadian accent, and this, her fringe debut, is a pin-sharp torrent of precision gags and delightfully silly one-liners about sex, self-esteem and being the nanny to a teenage girl.Catherine Bohart: Immaculate (Pleasance Bunker Two)She’s the bisexual daughter of a Catholic deacon with OCD, so she has plenty to go on... Bohart charms with this debut about family ties, illness and how annoying it is when your parents make themselves at home.The Greatest Play in the History of the World (Traverse 2)Julie Hesmondhalgh stars in this sci-fi-ish story so unapologetically romantic and lovely that the audience let out a collective “ahhh” as it ended.Ivo Graham: Motion Sickness (Pleasance Cabaret Bar)Amiable, pleasingly straightforward riffs from the old Etonian (it’s his USP) on the anxieties of getting engaged, starting a family and giving up hangovers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d60ba1c091fbdc92224fcf4b5656a51f4769d9/0_119_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8184630c884f4d70220eb8f36bb1ad39","title":"kate berlant review assembly george square edinburgh fringe festival","story":"Assembly George Square, EdinburghThis pin-sharp satire on self-love doesn’t aspire to comedy so much as ‘connect’ with its audience, yet positively gleams with surprises and smart impro‘I’m gonna go.” The first words of American comic Kate Berlant’s Edinburgh debut sets the tone. She has entered the stage, read the room – and tonight, it just doesn’t feel right, so “I’m gonna go”. Spoiler alert: she doesn’t – and thank goodness, because what follows is a pin-sharp satire on self-love and self-care, millennial-style. It’s effectively character-comedy, but Berlant is brave, or devious, enough to pretend the character is her. To what extent she has a prepared set, or whether she’s making it up on the hoof, is hard to tell. She is, the New York Times tells us, “at the forefront of experimental comedy”. Hers is not so much a show as a 60-minute preen. We meet a woman whose self-regard needs its own exclusion zone, who assumes we must be fascinated by her every utterance. She isn’t here to perform comedy – perish the vulgar thought! – but to commentate, moment by moment, on the connection she’s making with her crowd. “I’m interested in the different tonalities of your laughter,” she blathers – and she nails the precious little vainglory of this brittle, self-delighted persona. I could imagine some viewers reacting as if to nails down a blackboard. You wait in vain for our host to stop interrogating, and congratulating, herself. She never drops her guard: “You don’t get to know everything,” she purrs, as if she’s been impossibly gracious to tell us anything at all. But I found Communikate constantly surprising and intriguing. And very funny: when Berlant shows us her preferred style of acting (“I want to do more dense forest work”), when she explains why festivals are against her principles, and when she demonstrates her psychic skills on the crowd. The latter act gives the show its backbone, as Berlant tries – and fails ridiculously – to read our minds. But if she’s duff at telepathy, she’s an ace at impro, and her off-the-cuff responses positively gleam as one after another stab at clairvoyance goes wrong. Finally, and reluctantly, she does exit the stage, 60 minutes later than intended. I hope she returns: hers is the most vivid new comic voice I’ve encountered on this year’s fringe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7167e537c10385ff997af2308daad2cb3fedeac/136_6_1997_1198/master/1997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=228be31a4b4d9271373f4d8568f08267","title":"nigel slaters toast review edinburgh festival 2018","story":"Traverse theatre, EdinburghFood’s nostalgic power is captured with mouth-watering success in this poignant staging of the popular memoirFood tells stories. The homemade mince pies that whisper of family Christmases, the lemon meringue pie that’s as much a battlefield as a dessert, the walnut whips that taste of desire and shame. Nigel Slater’s gastronomic memories, brought to the stage complete with tastes and smells, are irresistibly evocative. As Slater knows, memory sits on the tongue as much as in the mind.In Henry Filloux-Bennett’s adaptation of Slater’s much-loved memoir, food remains centre stage. Against the backdrop of Libby Watson’s picture-book kitchen set, nine-year-old Nigel helps his mum make jam tarts, eating rounds of toast while they bake in the Aga. “It is impossible not to love someone who makes toast for you,” he says, chewing on a slice of his mum’s perpetually charred bread. It’s a short-lived taste of comfort before Slater’s mother dies and his world is tipped upside down. Food is the only constant.Jonnie Riordan’s engaging production suggests both the sharpness and the fallibility of memory. Moments skip and repeat. The past interrupts the present. The simple, generic outlines of the design, like a half-remembered image of a kitchen, contrast with the specificity of conversations and recipes. And laid on top of it all is Slater’s narration, delivered warmly – and often with a knowing, meta-theatrical charm – by Sam Newton as young Nigel, breaking out of scenes to share his recollections.Slater’s childhood is often unhappy, haunted by the spectres of illness and death, as well as a despised stepmother. These miseries are not skipped over, but it’s the joy – however fragile and quickly gobbled up – that stands out. Riordan’s work with Frantic Assembly is evident in smoothly choreographed sequences that infuse fun and tenderness into Slater’s anecdotes. A gentle moment between mother and son becomes a countertop waltz. The delicious rivalry of a culinary battle plays out to the iconic bassline of Talking Heads’ Psycho Killer.And at the heart of it all, food. Smells of cooking waft tantalisingly from the stage and sweet treats are distributed to the audience, all bringing with them the unmistakable and bittersweet taste of childhood. A nostalgic feast worth savouring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c915fcaa03d352ff4817c7ff104bf34d6704a41/0_104_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=841a0cb9c3b96c296c3813f1119ed94d","title":"the political history of smack and crack edinburgh festival 2018","story":"Roundabout @ Summerhall, EdinburghA desperate love story is set against a broader picture of government hostility in Ed Edwards’ gritty two-handerAccording to this urgent two-hander, the name they had for heroin in Strangeways prison was “Margaret Thatcher’s brown”. If true, it’s an astute example of drug-related slang. As Ed Edwards’s play explains, the heroin epidemic of the early 80s was not an accident driven by thirst for an addictive drug but a lethal consequence of social policy, international politics and a government drive to quell a restive working class. Despite the title, the greater part of The Political History of Smack and Crack is an empathetic portrait of two long-term addicts. In an almost unbreakable cycle of dependency and recovery, they go from robbing chemists to prostitution, from spells in jail to Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Played by Eve Steele and Neil Bell, fluidly jumping back and forth across the decades in Cressida Brown’s in-the-round production, they frequently contest the accuracy of each other’s narration as if even memory has fallen prey to their addiction. Nervous and unsettled, they are vulnerable not just to the drug but the lifestyle, be it the thrill of stealing shoes or the uncritical company of fellow users. With humour and honesty, they give an unsentimental account of a pattern of behaviour from which death is often the only release. Juxtaposed with this impossible love story is an analysis of how the situation came to be. If it’s a little awkwardly appended to the fictional tale – and too briefly examined – the political insight is shrewd. The play takes us back to 8 July 1981, when riots erupted in several British cities in response to police heavy-handedness and a government indifferent to deprivation. Before this point, Edwards argues, heroin was a middle-class drug that affected relatively few people. In the same way Irvine Welsh’s Trainspotting attributes the proliferation of HIV in 1980s Edinburgh to a council policy on the provision of needles, Edwards blames the rise in heroin use on a toxic combination of British appeasement of the regimes in Nicaragua and Afghanistan and a Brave New World-style attempt to quieten an angry population. It damningly shows how the personal can be fatally political."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e068d9f3f6f2294ff875a2a9069896b88e4df9/140_0_4205_2523/master/4205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ca6fed4115788458ee7d707ecea381","title":"10 best new tv dramas autumn 2018","story":"Buzz is growing for this boldly unconventional family drama, the first arrival from the BBC’s impressive autumn slate. The terrific Toni Collette – star of the film Muriel’s Wedding and now a potential Oscar dark horse for her performance in Hereditary – and Steven Mackintosh star as a long-married couple from Manchester trying to reignite their relationship by, ahem, revolutionary means. Created by award-winning playwright Nick Payne, loosely based on his 2010 stage production of the same name, it has an infectious soundtrack and is warmly funny and surprisingly sexy. Altogether now: you’re terrible, Muriel.Expected: late August, BBC OneWith his corrupt cop thriller Line of Duty getting more fiendishly gripping with each passing series, writer Jed Mercurio’s stock is sky-high. He reunites with LofD star Keeley Hawes for this political thriller, in which Game of Thrones’s Richard Madden is a volatile war veteran assigned to protect Hawes’s ambitious home secretary. He fundamentally disagrees with her views, but does that make him a threat or an asset? “I don’t need you to vote for me,” she says. “Only to protect me.” Banish traumatic memories of Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston in the 90s bonkbuster of similar title. This will have more knuckle-gnawing tension and far fewer power ballads.Expected: late August on BBC OneWhile Fleabag fans await series two (be patient, it’s due next year), they might be surprised by the stylistic gear-change of creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s interim project: a high-stakes, cat-and-mouse spy thriller that’s a million miles away from grungy sex in NW5. Grey’s Anatomy and Sideways star Sandra Oh is the MI5 officer who becomes obsessed with tracking Jodie Comer’s psychopathic assassin. It’s as subversive and wittily scripted as you’d expect from Waller-Bridge, with a feminist tone that perfectly fits the #MeToo era. Based on Observer dance critic Luke Jennings’s Villanelle novels, it’s already been an Emmy-nominated hit on BBC America, which has only served to stoke anticipation here.Expected: September on BBC One (weekly episodes) and BBC Three (instant box set)With the likes of Downton Abbey, The Durrells, Endeavour and Victoria, recent years have seen ITV sneak up on the rails to give the BBC a run for its ye olde money in period drama. The channel’s flagship autumn offering is a fresh, funny take on William Makepeace Thackeray’s Victorian romp, co-produced with Amazon. Rising Hollywood star Olivia Cooke plays social-climbing anti-heroine Becky Sharp, while the strong supporting cast includes Martin Clunes, Frances de la Tour, Simon Russell Beale, Suranne Jones - and, deliciously, Michael Palin as Thackeray himself.Expected: September on ITVEleven years ago, long before Oscars came calling, Emma Stone and Jonah Hill co-starred in potty-mouthed, teen-sex farce Superbad. Now they’ve reunited for Netflix’s mind-bending new black comedy. Based on a 2014 Norwegian series of the same name and stylishly directed by True Detective’s Cary Fukunaga, this trippy 10-parter sees the Hollywood pair play strangers who meet in a mental-health facility, where a psychotropic pharmaceutical trial goes awry. Think Legion meets Black Mirror. The cast also boasts Sally Field, Jemima Kirke (Jessa from Girls) and Justin Theroux – mop-topped, bespectacled and looking unnervingly like his documentary-making cousin, Louis.Expected: 21 September on NetflixSally Wainwright is one of our finest TV writers, her CV crammed with critical and ratings hits like Happy Valley, Scott \u0026amp Bailey and Last Tango in Halifax, but her latest creation is her most intriguing yet. Period drama Gentleman Jack tells the extraordinary story of 19th-century landowner, adventurer, industrialist and intellectual Anne Lister, hailed as “the first modern lesbian”. Wainwright grew up near Lister’s ancestral Yorkshire home of Shibden Hall, has devoured her extensive diaries, and calls her “one of the most exuberant, thrilling and brilliant women in British history”. With Suranne Jones in the title role and Wainwright on directorial as well as script duties, this eight‑part drama has Bafta winner written across it in big bold letters. Expected: October on BBC OneWriter-director Hugo Blick is one of the most distinctive TV dramatists around, creating ambitious series including the The Honourable Woman and The Shadow Line. Now he turns to the west’s relationship with contemporary Africa and the prosecution of international war crimes. Chewing Gum’s magnificent Michaela Coel stars as a woman rescued in childhood from the Rwandan genocide and raised in Britain by a globetrotting lawyer (Harriet Walter). When her adoptive mother tries to bring an African militia leader to justice, she’s pulled into a journey that upends her life. Hollywood veteran John Goodman, fresh from the ill‑fated Roseanne revival, also stars in this epic quest thriller.Expected: October on BBC TwoEighty years after the infamous radio broadcast reportedly sparked mass panic that the Martian invasion was real, a major retelling of HG Wells’s sci-fi classic lands. This will be a faithful rendering, set in Edwardian-era London. Rafe Spall and Poldark’s Eleanor Tomlinson are the unconventional couple fighting to survive a genuinely scary alien invasion, supported by Rupert Graves and Robert Carlyle. Adapted by Doctor Who writer Peter Harness, it’s more period horror than Tom Cruise cheese-fest.Expected: October on BBC OneThree years since Don Draper hung up his slim-cut grey suit, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner returns to television with this new anthology series, rumoured to have a $50m mega-budget. A world away from Madison Avenue during the 60s, it tells eight standalone contemporary stories about people around the world who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian royal family. A starry cast includes some Mad Men alumni, as you might expect – notably Christina “Joan” Hendricks and John “Roger” Slattery – alongside heavyweights like Isabelle Huppert, Aaron Eckhart and Diane Lane. We’ll raise an Old-Fashioned to that.Expected: 12 October on Amazon PrimeRelax, musical theatre-phobes. The BBC’s lavish new version of Victor Hugo’s classic weepie, adapted by corset king Andrew Davies, isn’t a musical but an epic, emotional dramatic retelling that takes the story back to its roots. The starry cast is led by Dominic West as Valjean, David Oyelowo as Javert and Lily Collins as Fantine, while Adeel Akhtar and Olivia Colman reprise their Night Manager double act as Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. “I thought the musical was a travesty, personally,” says Davies.

Founded by author Dave Eggers and the not-for-profit organizer Amanda Uhle, the congress brought together nearly 100 youth activists from around the world and noted guest speakers – including the US Representative John Lewis and the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie – for readings, mentorship, and collaborative learning.At the end of the three-day congress, the delegates wrote a group manifesto, which, in the coming weeks, will be translated and published in several languages.We are a network of empowered youth voices from around the globe that strive to take action for the world we wish to see. We recognize the issues that threaten human rights within our generation let’s counteract them by implementing innovative solutions in the areas of health, education, social justice, security, and the environment. Our vision is to create a global system which encourages youth to take action for what they believe in – even when others might not. We intend to bring a bright light to the world’s most pressing issues and promote sustainable solutions. By the youth. For the youth.We aspire to leave our national ego at the door and enter the gates of our global communities with an open mind. We must use an intersectional lens to self-reflect and be able to access connections and other views after acknowledging bias.Intersectionality is the overarching framework for change. Intersectionality is understanding our communal and inidual experiences as informed by our many identities.In order to do this, we need to hold these values:We cannot do necessary personal work if we need to prioritize our daily survival.Recognizing the foundation of our experiences.Solidarity and community.No one is left behind. All of us are working towards collective freedom by reforming inidualism and moving in togetherness. We will be able to do so by staying connected through a network regardless of our countries, while updating each other on our social work. We must accept responsibility to be one voice of change. We must acknowledge each other’s strengths, using them to cover each other’s weaknesses. In the words of the great Dr Martin Luther King Jr: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” and “no one is free unless we are all free.”Art is traveling without traveling. Art is a language that does not need western translation. Art is a mini-scale revolution. It is an extraordinary and compelling method for communicating one’s experiences, while keeping in mind that everyone’s narratives are multi-faceted.If we are advocating for empathy, we must empathize with those we do not agree with but are willing to understand. To empathize is to uplift and inspire through the validation of our stories and experiences. As young artivists, we must recognize empathy as a medium that connects us to the world in order to enact positive social change.It is imperative that we honor each other’s inidual experiences and narratives without exploiting them. In order to incite the change we need in the world, we must understand that we as a collective will be met with hate and rejection, but we must remain patient, empathetic, and reflective.Investment in education is an investment in the future and in order for our world to improve, it is imperative that education should be a right and not a privilege. It is important that we break the harsh restrictions, specifically for students of color, from attending schools outside of their districts and pursuing higher education. At the same time, we can make, expand, and promote programs within our schools and communities.With disproportionate ratios of counselors to students, it is important to incorporate college access resource centers and programs within schools. We must appreciate and cherish our teachers by paying them better for affordable housing so that they can continue to educate and empower the youth.We could go to our school boards to make small community changes and make bigger impacts, not only in our community, but globally.Our lives are so often defined by our education – in order to create a more equal we need a more equal educational system.We must hold curiosity and respect for cultural differences and remember that where you were born is not what defines you. It is who you choose to be. We must honor the credibility of the oppressed and we must reject the collective because opposition from the oppression is our obsession. We must hold ourselves and others accountable for our past and our future. We must redefine our imagination, to imagine taking back our lands, our wealth, and our humanness. And first and foremost we must stop making humans aliens to our unalienable rights.The intersectionality of identity and ancestry and how it affects and shows up in our arts and education:“Until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.” – Chinua AchebeIt is a privilege to know your ancestry. To know where your family comes from is to know where you come from. To not know where you come from is to not know who you are. Lost identity makes you vulnerable to systems of oppression. Lost identity manifests into internalized oppression that becomes present in our bodies and in our manners of expression. Oppressive narratives fill the void of self-representation. Stigmas swallow your self-image. We are being denied ourselves in the lack of representation in schools that only show the oppressors in their glory. To know your history is to be undeniable. We will not be denied anymore.We are committed to the mobilization of youth advocates and activists internationally through continuous community building, days of social action, and global initiatives. We believe that hope, resilience, and community must be the core of our mobilization. Our updates and progress shall be published in the multiple languages represented by our global delegation. This delegation stands together as a network of knowledge and resources – economically, emotionally, and spiritually.

They suspect it of acting as a “trojan horse” for the government of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by backing the Kremlin’s foreign policy and helping it meddle in domestic Czech politics.Suspicions have been further aroused by the communist background of the prime minister, Babiš, who is believed to have been a one-time agent for the Czechoslovak secret police, the StB, and the pro-Russian views of Miloš Zeman, the Czech president who has long advocated the communists’ return to the political mainstream.“There are many connections,” said Jiří Cihlář, 53, a Prague estate agent who accused today’s communists of seeking to weaken the Czech Republic’s membership of Nato and the EU. “Today’s communists are fanatical supporters of contemporary Russia and Putin. If you compare the Soviet Union’s imperial policy of the ’68 invasion with Russia’s current policy, the substance remains the same. Only the means have changed.”Marek Navrátil, 24, a human resource specialist for NGOs, added: “If you look at their leaders’ statements, most of them say the Soviet Union liberated us and that it was friendly help intended to bring stability.“If the same thing happened today, it’s likely they would have the same reaction. You can see it in their defence of Russian foreign policy and their support for the annexation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. There’s a pattern connecting what’s happening today with ’68.”The KSČMX, a successor to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia founded in 1921, refutes such accusations as a falsification of history, fabricated by opponents to demonise it and present-day Russia.The party’s leader, Vojtěch Filip, 63, a lawyer who joined the party in 1983 at the height of the cold war, spoke to the  in the Czech parliament. In his office a sign on the wall in English read: “Where nothing goes right, go left.”He insisted that Russia hadplayed little part in the invasion.Some of the invasion’s strongest advocates, Filip added, had been leaders of theSoviet satellite states, such as East Germany, Poland and Hungary, who saw the Prague Spring as a threat to their own power. He called the event a “reality of the bipolar world ision” resulting from the cold war between east and west. He also placed some blame with Dubček, whom he claimed had known of the invasion two days in advance but had failed to warn the public.The main long-term consequence, he said, had been the damage to the international socialist movement, leading to the collapse of communist regimes in eastern Europe in 1989.He dismissed opposition suggestions that the KSČM took orders from Russia’s embassy in Prague to spout pro-Moscow policies. “Our partner in Russia is the Communist party of the Russian Federation and the greatest protest against Putin was organised by them. I don’t know one person in the Russian embassy here who is a member.”While the votes of the 15 Communist MPs are essential to keeping the coalition between Babiš’ ANO party and the Social Democrats (ČSSD) in office, the arrangement masks the party’s political weakness, say analysts.Babišwas forced to resort to communist support after most mainstream parties refused to serve under him due to criminal charges he faces over alleged EU subsidy fraud. He has rebuffed the party’s demands to reduce contributions to overseas military missions or introduce a bill that could lead to referendums on Nato or EU membership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41ef2f0361e6d39ef0d310b845dce86f9a7b22da/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3befdfe4d8874178edb05a1de37ac120","title":"mali votes in runoff election amid heavy security presence","story":"Soldiers search voters in presidential poll in which Cissé is challenging incumbent KeïtaMillions of Malians are voting in an unprecedented runoff presidential election that has been overshadowed by widespread allegations of fraud and the threat of Islamist extremist violence.Mali is key in the battle against Islamic extremism in the Sahel region and and is central to efforts to restrict illegal immigration to Europe.French, US and UN troops have been fighting militants in the unstable and impoverished country since 2012 when ethnic and Islamist groups seized swaths of territory and the city of Timbuktu.Government authority is still weak in many places and observers say militants, some linked to al-Qaida and Islamic State, have regrouped since French troops intervened in 2013 to push them back. They have been expanding their influence across Mali’s desert north and into the fertile centre. The civil society website Malilink recorded 932 attacks in the first half of 2018, almost double the figure for all of 2017 and triple that for 2015. Security services said on Saturday they had disrupted a plot to carry out “targeted attacks” in the capital, Bamako. Three members of an alleged “commando” cell, suspected of involvement in a robbery that left three people dead in 2016, are accused of “plotting targeted attacks”.Jihadists have worked to stoke intercommunal conflict. Killings along ethnic lines have claimed hundreds of civilian lives this year, including at least 11 last week in the Mopti region. But as voting got under way early on Sunday, no serious incidents were reported. Soldiers ran body checks on voters waiting in line under rainy skies in Bamako to cast their ballots. Dramane Camara, 31, was the first to vote at one polling station in a school in Bamako. “I voted without problem. I came to fulfil my duty as a citizen,” Camara said. “I expect the new president to solve the problem of the north, which is peace. Because the return of peace means the return of NGOs, investors, so creating jobs.” The 73-year-old Keïta, who is seeking a second five-year term, called for a peaceful day and urged people not to respond to any provocation as he voted in Bamako. “I pledge that all the difficulties we faced are now behind us,” he told cheering supporters. The first round on 29 July was also marred by opposition charges of fraud. Cissé, 68, has accused Keïta of stuffing ballot boxes in areas of the country that are most unstable and where the rule of law is weakest.The former finance minister blames Keïta for the worsening violence and has accused his government of rampant corruption. He insisted on Friday he could turn things around on polling day, warning the status quo would only bring “chaos” in a “torn nation”.But Cissé failed to unite the opposition behind him, and first-round challengers have either backed the president or refused to tell followers which way to vote.Few Malians attended a string of planned marches and protests called for by opposition leaders in Bamako ahead of the runoff vote.At his final rally on Friday, Keïta – known as IBK – struck a confident tone. “Some people were sceptical that these elections could take place. Some called on me to withdraw,” he said above the din of his supporters’ vuvuzelas. “Let them understand that we had the capacity to organise credible elections and we have done so.” One reason for the relative apathy among voters may be the similarities between the two candidates. Keïta, who was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, and Cissé, a software engineer and economist, are veteran politicians and part of a well-entrenched political establishment.Despite the militant threat, Malian polls have generally gone peacefully, without the post-election violence common to many countries in the region.

Both items find their place in the House of European History, an EU-funded museum that aims to tell the story of a continent.HEH, which opened a year ago at a cost of €55.4m (£47m), is probably the EU’s boldest cultural project. “There are tens of thousands of museums in Europe, but they all have a national, regional or local perspective,” says Constanze Itzel, the museum’s director. A museum dedicated to pan-European history, rather than inidual countries, has never been done before, she adds. National objects are jumbled together, so visitors can see common themes about nation-building, war or consumerism. A copy of the first Norwegian constitution is next to a decorative flask featuring the hero of Italian unification, Giuseppe Garibaldi.But those seeking details on the French Revolution, or the life and times of Winston Churchill, will be disappointed. “The harshest criticisms comes from those who expected to see their national heroes,” says Itzel. Although run by a team of independent curators, an EU-funded history museum was always going to be controversial.Some of the earliest critics were British tabloids and Ukip MEPs, who described the museum as a “house of horrors” and “an expensive, wrong-headed palace of propaganda”.More recently, Poland’s nationalist government has gone on the attack: the deputy prime minister, Piotr Gliński, who is responsible for culture, complained that the HEH played down famous Poles and showed the country as complicit in the Holocaust.Historians think this critique is rooted in the same ultra-conservative “politics of memory” that has led to managers and international experts being forced out of Poland’s Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk.However, the Law and Justice party government failed to force changes in Brussels. MEPs said they would not interfere and referred Warsaw to the curators. Polish officials say they are in “constant dialogue” with the museum.Those looking for a temple to EU propaganda will be disappointed. A visitor has to climb to the fourth floor before seeing the blue and gold EU insignia. The display on the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community is modest, surrounded by exhibits about US-inspired consumerism and Soviet tanks rolling into eastern Europe. Objects can mean different things to different people. A tin of canned beef emblazoned with the EU flag dropped into Sarajevo during the 1995 siege could be seen as a testament to humanitarian interventionism. But locals remember remember this offering “as worse than dog food”, says the curator, Martí Grau Segú, while the EU was criticised for doing nothing to avert humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkans.Likewise, the EU’s 2012 Nobel peace prize is displayed near a replica protest banner against the award that condemned the bloc for “crisis, chaos and unemployment”.Some critics think the focus on colonialism, war and, more recently, the migration crisis, means a positive story has gone missing.“The museum is like an empty shrine,” says Jakub Jareš, a historian at the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in the Czech Republic. The museum is “quite German”, he adds, because of the focus on reckoning with the traumatic past. Jareš, a museum specialist, thinks the 10-year development time was not enough for the museum to “achieve the goal they wanted … a European narrative”.A decade in the making, this was the third attempt to create a European history museum. When lawmakers embarked on the current project in 2007, the EU was reeling from the rejection of the constitution by French and Dutch voters.Hans-Gert Pöttering, a former European parliament president who proposed the museum 11 years ago, said it would be a means to “cultivate European unification and memory of European history” at a time when the bloc was struggling to connect with voters. “The past is simply too big. There is too much of it for everything to be shown,” says Davies, who has written his own take on the history of Europe and is now a member of the HEH academic panel. The outcome “is not perfect” but “much better than I feared”, he says. Although deploring Polish government “propagandists”, he thinks they have a point.The academic committee wanted to ensure that “European history was not seen as the sum total of national histories, but an overarching view of developments”. Now Davies wonders if there ought to have been more concessions to national history – corners of the museum dedicated to great Europeans.“Most visitors will have learned their history in a national context. There is a disconnect between the exhibition and what visitors want to see,” he says.The museum will evolve – many pieces are on loan and will have to be replaced. The top floor is half-empty and the director plans an exhibition of visitor comments. “They are also part of the debate,” Itzel says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d239d7f2a7e4b409e69ef32e68be210df6371acb/5_151_2024_1214/master/2024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da2cef2a774e0d0ebc5324f2db926e5","title":"smitten with kittens advert for cat caring job on greek isle brings deluge of candidates","story":"Sanctuary has to curtail number of applicants eager to take job looking after 55 rescue cats ‘in Cyclades paradise’As job offers go it’s hard to beat.

But with less than eight months to go until Britain leaves the European Union there is still little clarity on its future trade relations with the bloc, or the Republic’s Border with Northern Ireland. The new route advanced by the commission would connect Ireland by sea with Dutch and Belgian ports, including Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. French ports such as Calais and Dunkirk would be bypassed.“France and Ireland maintain important trade channels, both overland via Britain and via direct maritime routes. The geographical proximity between Ireland and France creates an obvious connection to the single market,” wrote French minister for transport Elisabeth Borne to the EU’s transport commissioner on August 10th.“Surprisingly, the Commission proposal in no way takes this into account. This proposal therefore is not acceptable to France,” noted Ms Borne.At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.Ms Borne said that French ports had the necessary resources to ensure they could handle the likely increase in trade flows, hinting at concerns of congestion in ports such as Calais, France’s busiest passenger port. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Due partly to the number of third-level colleges, Galway has one of the highest tenancy rates in the State.  Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyGalway is fast becoming a city where “only tourists can afford to rent a bed”, a debate on housing has heard. The Government’s rent-pressure zone legislation is “not working”, as there is no effective monitoring of landlords who cite “refurbishment or sale” to replace tenants at a property, a newly formed housing support group in Galway claimed.Speaking at a debate on housing at the Galway Feminist Collective Festival on Saturday, Eadaoin de Faoite of the Galway Housing Support Group said many city-centre apartments and houses formerly rented by students were now registered as Airbnbs.Galway City Council needed to take action to cap the number of Airbnbs, similar to systems introduced in several European cities, Ms de Faoite told the seminar.Galway city has been a rent-pressure zone since January 2017, as one of a number of designated areas including Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Wicklow and Cork, where rent increases are capped at 4 per cent annually over a three-year period.Due partly to the number of third-level colleges, Galway has one of the highest tenancy rates in the State, but Ms de Faoite said many tenants were being forced further and further out of the city, similar to the situation in Dublin.She said that a community response was required, similar to that which has already happened in Dublin, where vulnerable tenants receive support from housing campaign groups.Ms de Faoite said gentrification and a focus on private commercial development of city-centre office spaces and hotels was turning Galway into a “city for tourists only”.Anny Cullum of the Acorn tenants’ union in Bristol, England, and Thomas Lynch and Aisling Bruen of Dublin Central Housing Action said community support for tenants could prove particularly effective. Acorn was formed in Bristol four years ago when rents began to rise as people were forced out of London, and its actions range from practical supports for tenants, to direct action, to picketing letting agencies and staging protests in banks. Ms Bruen and Mr Lynch said the current occupation of a house in Summerhill parade in Dublin aimed to highlight the need to protect vulnerable tenants from forced evictions, and the need for local authorities to use compulsory purchase order legislation to acquire vacant properties.The protest was “different” to the occupation of Apollo House in Dublin city centre in December 2016, in that no one person was staying in the building for any length of time.The occupation has been a “hub” and a “focal point” for the homelessness crisis, Ms Bruen and Mr Lynch said.“We want to encourage other groups to set up occupations... we need it to snowball,” they said.Recent Department of Housing figures for Galway showed an increase in the number of families living in emergency accommodation, with 82 families including 233 children in May 2018.A “one day census” on June 22nd, 2018, by the homeless non-governmental organisation Cope Galway showed 160 households, comprising 82 families with 221 children, five couples and 73 single people were either accommodated by it or in other emergency accommodation, while 16 people were sleeping rough and a further 15 families and five single people were at immediate risk of homelessness or “sofa surfing” with family and friends."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3592457.1533922533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"omagh the smell of burning flesh that s something i have to live with","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gallagher, chairman of the Omagh Victims Support Group. Photograph: Eric LukeLooking up the main street of Omagh, Co Tyrone, it is easy to miss Market Street Arcade.A narrow alleyway roughly a metre wide and a few metres long, it was to this spot that many of the victims of the Omagh bomb were first brought.“We laid the first one here, then put them across in rows,” former police officer Richard Scott recalls.His voice catches and he pauses. “We continued on until this was completely full of bodies.”Only half an hour before, the street had been full of Saturday afternoon shoppers. A warning of a bomb at the courthouse meant that the other end of the street had been evacuated and members of the public were directed – unwittingly – towards the bottom of the town. A car containing a 1,000lb device had been left there by the Real IRA.At 3.10pm on August 15th, 1998, it exploded. The final death toll was 31 – 29 men, women and children, and unborn twins, of all ages, religions and backgrounds. It was the largest loss of life from any single atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles.Like many people that August afternoon, Kevin Skelton and his family had come into Omagh to buy school uniforms.He had left his wife, Mena, and their three teenage daughters shopping for school shoes.Skelton points to the street. “That’s the spot there, where the car was.”A glass obelisk engraved with a heart now stands in its place a plaque on the wall beside marks the “act of terror” which “killed thirty-one people, injured hundreds, and killed forever the lives of many”.Skelton was in the shop next door. “Bang. The bomb went off.”“I found Mena lying dead in the rubble. The first person to arrive was a fireman I knew, and once he lifted Mena’s arm and dropped it, I knew.”His immediate concern was his daughters. Fifteen-year-old Tracy had been knocked unconscious, but he later found her kneeling beside her mother.“I was digging, I thought she was lying underneath her mother. I was pulling things away and there were certain things you lifted you might find an arm and it not connected to anything. It was awful.“The smell of burning flesh, that’s something I have to live with, and the screaming. I can still hear it.”Ulsterbus district inspector Paddy McGowan arrived just minutes after the explosion. Running towards the site of the bomb, he met a group of children who he later learned were from Buncrana, Co Donegal. Three children from the town – James Barker, Oran Doherty and Sean McLaughlin – as well as a Spanish boy, Fernando Blasco Baselga, and his teacher Rocio Abad Ramos, who had been staying with them, would be among the dead.“They were all running, and crying, and blood was coming from some of them.“There were bodies everywhere, and the buildings were nearly all demolished. Everything was in complete turmoil.“People had started to cover up the bodies. There was a shop that sold bed linen and it had been blown out onto the street, and people were using duvet covers to cover them over.”Seeing one of his buses at the corner of Market Street, he waved the driver over and began helping the wounded onto the bus.“Those who were able to walk got on the bus, and others we carried them on. I didn’t realise it at the time, but some of them had actually lost limbs.”Scott had also heard the bomb go off. He and a colleague grabbed first aid kits from the police station, and then drove into the town centre.“For a strange moment it all went so quiet. I looked up and there was a window in one of the buildings and you could just see the window coming down as if in slow motion and crashing.“It went silent, and then everybody started to scream again because they thought it was another bomb going off.”Tyrone County Hospital was only a few minutes away from the town centre. The senior surgeon on call was Dr Domingos Pinto.“I opened the double doors to A\u0026ampE and it was absolute bedlam. It was like a battlefield. People were everywhere, even on the floor, or looking for their relatives.“I went in and the first thing I noticed was a child being resuscitated. It was a little baby. It died.“Another person, the nurse couldn’t feel a pulse. I went to her, and she had died.“I realised we were going to have casualties and I asked a nurse to clear a ward and make that a mortuary because I didn’t know how many people were going to come in, but we had to treat the dead with dignity.”The outpatient department was opened to treat the walking wounded, and doctors began assessing patients and arranging, where necessary, for them to be sent to other hospitals.Dr Pinto operated on patients until 10 o’clock that night below, in A\u0026ampE, was the hospital’s medical director, Dr Clive Russell.“Most of our job was triaging and deciding who needed to go and who needed to stay, and that went on for hours and hours.“I remember going out about 4 or 5 o’clock in the afternoon to the helipad and I could see three helicopters, one on the ground and two above, all waiting to take people away.”Following an appeal for help broadcast on television and radio, doctors, nurses and others had been arriving to offer their services.“We had the most amazing response,” says Dr Russell. “I remember walking down the corridor and being stopped by this man who asked could he help. It turned out he was a coastguard, and we really needed someone who was able to talk down helicopters he was fantastic.”Work was also beginning to identify the dead and injured. Dr Russell recalls a couple who kept asking him to look for a young girl.“I checked and checked and I said no, I hadn’t seen her, but she had been brought in dead, she was only 12 or 13, but we had set up a temporary mortuary and I didn’t know until much later that her remains were upstairs.”Among those who had come to the hospital to look for their loved ones was Michael Gallagher. He had last seen his son Aidan earlier that afternoon, when he had gone into town to buy a pair of jeans.All that night and into the next afternoon, families were brought to a temporary mortuary at the nearby army base to identify the dead. It was there that Michael Gallagher identified his son Aidan. “I had to go home and tell my wife and two girls that Aidan wasn’t coming home,” says his father.The Barker family, from Buncrana, were among the last to arrive James’s mother, Donna-Maria, had been at home when the police came to her door to say James was missing.“I remember going to see him and he was in this tiny room, and I remember wanting to put my arms round him and kiss him and an army guy put up his hands to stop me and I remember shouting, ‘you’re not going to stop me holding my son’.“He was draped in something green, it looked like a green curtain over him, and on his face was just a white handkerchief.“I took it off and I remember saying why did they not wash his face, because it was covered in blood, but his eyes, I remember thinking what beautiful emerald green eyes he had.“I knew he had green eyes but I never realised how beautiful they were.”In the 20 years since, nobody has been convicted of the murders at Omagh. Some relatives continue to campaign for justice others believe that they – and the town – have been let down by politicians and by all those who promised that Omagh would be looked after. Others – particularly those who were injured or who responded on the day – continue to deal with the trauma, both physical and mental, it inflicted on their lives. Yet others are hopeful and say that while their loved ones will never be forgotten, the town itself has moved on.In the week ahead, the focus in Omagh – and elsewhere – will be on remembrance. Services are to be held on Sunday, and on the 20th anniversary of the explosion on Wednesday smaller memorials are planned for, among others, Omagh hospital and Buncrana.Now living in England, James Barker’s family had moved to Buncrana to escape the Troubles. Among his mother’s memories are of a smiling boy who loved football – especially Chelsea FC – and who had been full of excitement at the thought of a trip to Omagh.“Four days before he was killed we were walking on the beach in Buncrana,” she says. “He was so happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3594029.1534106940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south dublin residents mobilise against nude bathing area","story":"A Fine Gael councillor will raise residents’ concerns in relation to a new nudist-friendly bathing area in Dalkey, south Co Dublin, at the next Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council meeting.Cllr John Bailey, who is based in Killiney, said 40 residents had signed a petition opposing the decision to signpost the bathing area as nudist-friendly.He would be bringing a motion to the next local authority meeting to have an “open dialogue” about the plans, and to ensure residents were consulted on the issue, he said.“There is a petition signed by 40 residents, and I have received 100 calls on this issue,” he said.The local authority announced in March that Hawk Cliff, a small rocky bathing area known locally as the Ramparts and located off Vico Road, would officially become nudist-friendly.The council plans to put up signposts advising the public that bathers may be naked in the area.There was a fear among local residents that the signposts could attract a “curiosity factor”, drawing people to the bathing area, Mr Bailey said.“I’m not against anybody enjoying themselves … People are living up there with children, sitting out in their front garden it’s not very nice,” he said. “There needs to be consultation, dialogue – making sure there is proper supervision, who’s going to manage it. At the end of the day it is a public amenity … it shouldn’t be exclusive for anybody.”In a recent letter to the Dalkey Newsletter, local resident Lorraine Montgomery said the bathing area was a public amenity and “shouldn’t be hijacked by a few”.Local Independent councillor Michael Merrigan said the issue of the bathing area was a “storm in a teacup”.Since the nudist bathing spot gained publicity in recent weeks, some residents had been raising opposition to the proposed signage, which some fear may “attract unwanted questionable activity” , he said.However, the local authority had a “responsibility to warn people” that the small bathing area was nudist-friendly, Mr Merrigan said. If there were any issues with antisocial behaviour at the area, it was a matter for gardaí and not the county council, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It is thought the combination of the two ingredients kills more mosquitoes and reduces the number of infective bites. The study was the first clinical trial in the world to compare use of bed nets containing two active ingredients with the traditional net.As with therapies against diseases such as a tuberculosis, which use a combination of drugs in patients to help tackle antibiotic resistance, researchers say it is less likely for mosquitoes to become resistant to both chemicals in the combination bed nets.Malaria remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers. In 2016, the disease infected 216 million people across 91 countries, up five million from the previous year and killed 445,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.Some 80 per cent of malaria transmission occurs in Africa. Since 2000, there has been huge investment in malaria control on the continent which has halved the amount of malaria thanks mostly to distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying of homes with mosquito-killing products.However, in the last three years progress against the disease has slowed – with numbers of infected people now increasing in some areas. Resistance to insecticides is thought to be one of the key causes  behind the stalling progress.“We are now entering a crucial point in the future history of malaria control globally and we need to have some good products,” said Prof Lindsay. “It’s an important contribution to the future of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.”Although a mosquito net alone is able to protect against malaria transmission for iniduals, treated nets are crucial in the broader fight against the disease, as insecticides when effective help reduce the overall population of mosquitoes in a community – leading to much more significant declines in rates of malaria.“The critical thing with malaria control is to reduce the average life of a mosquito,” said Prof Lindsay.As well as reducing the rate of malaria, the researchers found that the new nets reduced anaemia rates among children sleeping under them by 52 per cent. Malaria anaemia which results from infection of red blood cells by malaria parasites is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old.The trial which was conducted by a team of scientists from the UK, Burkino Faso and Switzerland was limited to 40 rural areas in Burkino Faso. Going forward, the researchers say that the next step will be to expand the study to further countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Prof Lindsay is hopeful that following further successful trials the  World Health Organization will approve the new nets.Malaria still kills a child every two minutes so we need to keep working to find the best ways to stop this from happening. It is clear that conventional methods used for controlling malaria mosquitoes need to be improved and new additional tools developed, he said.“If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us again,” he added.War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Bed nets are crucial in the fight against malaria and have come a long way since the first ones dipped in insecticide were used in Africa in the 1980s. Unlike modern long-lasting insecticidal nets, the insecticide in early nets was not able to withstand washing and had to be re-treated every six months – a logistical challenge in many rural areas.Dr James Tibenderana,  technical director at the Malaria Consortium who was not involved in the research said that resistance was a significant concern.“It’s quite worrying for us to find some of the insecticides are not as effective as they have been in the past,” he said.He said that pyrethroids are rare in that they can get into the yarn of the net effectively at a concentration that is both effective and safe  while being well-priced. “We will probably not get that ideal again so we will be dealing with new dynamics.” “We needed new nets four or five years ago so we are catching up. Whatever net we get now it’s going to take time to get it out there,” said Dr Tibenderana.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security   Impact of social media on children’s mental health is a \u0026#39real tragedy for our time\u0026#39, says new private schools chiefTraditional Turkish barber shops are using slave labour, warns police officer behind first child modern slavery conviction Fox hunts are merging to survive as experts say that the future of the tradition will push different groups to join forcesScottish pupils awarded National 5s after getting only 35 per cent as dozens of grade thresholds cutRoyal women should play polo with their husbands watching from the sidelines, says world\u0026#39s top female player Unforgotten, series 3 episode 5: have the police finally got the right man?John Smyth\u0026#39s abuse victims \u0026#39incandescent with rage\u0026#39 at lack of justice before he diedExplosion at Syrian weapons depot kills 39Rare Second World War bomb shelter sign obliterated by blundering workmen in DeptfordComment: Paris has found a pungent way to make itself even more of a crushing disappointmentOlympic gold medallist Chris Boardman hits out at laws treating killer cyclists like dangerous driversGreek cat sanctuary \u0026#39overwhelmed\u0026#39 with emails after advertising paid job on idyllic island with 55 felinesStacks of fun and a calming hobby - or a blot on the beachscape?\u0026#39It\u0026#39s a perfect storm\u0026#39: Pressure mounts on Barcelona mayor over city securityWant to make takeaways healthy?

A living wage, a car, a lovely house to live in - bills paid - with a terrace overlooking the Aegean, just a short walk from a pristine beach on the Greek island of Syros.The job? Caring for up to 70 cats amounting to four hours of work per day.Nearly 1,000 Britons applied for the role after the announcement posted by Greek cat sanctuary owner Joan Bowell on Facebook last week went viral.Her inbox is brimming with applications from hopeful cat caretakers convinced they are the “responsible, reliable, honest, practically inclined” person with a heart of gold she is looking for.Veterinarians, doctors, even refugees applied.    “We were doing a quiet thing on a Greek island -  but no more,” Mrs Bowell’s husband, Richard, 65, told The .The job involves just four hours work per dayMrs Boswell, a Briton, and Mr Boswell, from Denmark, moved to the island of Syros seven years ago. They found kittens thrown away in garbage cans, bony cats relying on scraps, feral and injured cats that needed care.The couple began taking in strays and working with local veterinarians to improve the health of village cat colony and the overall island population.They backed a sterilisation project, funded dental operations, had sick eyes removed, and nursed motherless kittens through the night. If cat dies, Mrs Bowell buries them and places a stone.“Now you hardly see distressed cats on Syros,” Mr Bowell says. “It all started here.”Sanctuary owners Joan and Richard Bowell have been overwhelmed by the interest in the advertToday the sanctuary is home to anywhere from 55-70 cats, all led around by the resident caretaker cat, Snowy.Mrs Bowell founded God’s Little People Cat Rescue charity to support the sanctuary with donations and started a Facebook page. At first her posts got a handful of likes as she tried to find homes for cats on Syros.“Then she posted this, it went viral and people have been phoning from all over the world.”  This fall, the couple plans to return New York, where Mr Bowell has work commitments with the United Nations. They have drafted five volunteers across Europe to narrow down the 3,000 applications from people offering to take their place – mostly Americans and British nationals – to a pool of 50-100. The job also comes with a car, bills paid, and a stunning view of the AegeanThere are those that start out with: “I’ve always wanted to live on a Greek island,” those who boldly proclaim: “I am your person” and those who say: “What is behind this?” and want to know more about the sanctuary’s philosophy.  “Those are the ones that catch our attention,” Mr Bowell said of the latter. “Sometimes whispers are best heard.”The position comes with a salary up to €600 (£536) a month, with bills, housing and veterinary expenses paid, starting November 1, after a voluntary two-week transition period in October.  There are bonus points for veterinarian skills, cat psychology skills for handling feral or non-sociable felines. Please review our commenting policyImpact of social media on children’s mental health is a \u0026#39real tragedy for our time\u0026#39, says new private schools chiefTraditional Turkish barber shops are using slave labour, warns police officer behind first child modern slavery conviction Fox hunts are merging to survive as experts say that the future of the tradition will push different groups to join forcesScottish pupils awarded National 5s after getting only 35 per cent as dozens of grade thresholds cutRoyal women should play polo with their husbands watching from the sidelines, says world\u0026#39s top female player Unforgotten, series 3 episode 5: have the police finally got the right man?John Smyth\u0026#39s abuse victims \u0026#39incandescent with rage\u0026#39 at lack of justice before he diedExplosion at Syrian weapons depot kills 39Rare Second World War bomb shelter sign obliterated by blundering workmen in DeptfordComment: Paris has found a pungent way to make itself even more of a crushing disappointmentOlympic gold medallist Chris Boardman hits out at laws treating killer cyclists like dangerous driversStacks of fun and a calming hobby - or a blot on the beachscape?\u0026#39It\u0026#39s a perfect storm\u0026#39: Pressure mounts on Barcelona mayor over city securityWant to make takeaways healthy?

But there is one area where the older woman is\u0026nbspthriving.\u0026nbspIn the week that Madonna turns 60, David Lister applauds the 60-something females who are gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and sexiness intactClick to followThe Independent OnlineMadonna at 60: Female pop stars entering their seventh decade are not just rocking – they\u0027re snarlingIt’s a truism that older women have had their visibility problems. City boardrooms are short of women in general, and women over 60 are certainly thin on the ground. Most notably, broadcasting has been notoriously shy of giving older women screen time.It was less than\u0026nbsptwo years ago that the head of the regulator\u0026nbspOfcom\u0026nbspaccused the BBC of “not doing as good a job as it should be” in its treatment of older women, after many complaints from viewers about a lack of mature female presenters.The corporation had long faced criticism for its treatment of older women, and lost an age discrimination case brought by Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who was sacked in 2009, to make way for younger presenters. \u0026nbspBut there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Earlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/19/15/cwacom03.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4371251  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1.

Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke.

We need to have a serious discussion about how we balance the need for tourism and the need for business to continue to run over the summer.UK news in picturesPolice officers stand guard at the scene of a shooting at Claremont Road in the Moss Side neighborhood of Manchester, Ten people were taken to hospital on August 12, 2018 after shots were fired in Manchester in northern England, police said.Jacob Rees-Mogg has called the Conservative Party investigation into allegedly Islamophobic comments by Boris Johnson England cricketer Ben Stokes and his wife Clare, arrives back at Bristol Crown Court where he is on trial accused of affray, following a lunch break Stokes, 27, is accused of knocking out two friends, Ryan Hale, 27, and Ryan Ali, 28, during an alleged dispute near a nightclub in the Clifton Triangle area of Bristol on September 25 last year.

Just under a third (28 per cent) said she should be replaced without a vote while 20 per cent said they did not know.But respondents were ided on whether the 2016 referendum result gave the prime minister a mandate to leave the EU without a deal, with 34 per cent believing it did and 36 per cent suggesting it did not.The new findings came as the People’s Vote campaign held a 700-strong rally at Bristol’s Colston Hall to demand a fresh referendum on the final Brexit deal.

Before March, when we got the transition agreement agreed lots of people said \u0026lsquowe wouldn\u0026rsquot get it,\u0026rsquo and we got there.All I\u0026rsquom asking is let\u0026rsquos wait and see what the Government can produce by the end of this year or this autumn as a result of the discussion with the European Union.I personally strongly back the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers agreement, I think it\u0026rsquos sensible.

That is absolutely unacceptable. We need to be one United Kingdom as we go forward.The third reason is that we promised to \u0026lsquotake back control, and with the oversight of the European Court of Justice we really won\u0026rsquot have left the EU.She concluded: We will have left in name only.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn about her reality TV romances rarely last beyond the first glossy magazine spread.I’M not in the least bit surprised that doctors don’t trust us to tell the truth when it comes to how much booze we guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for likening woman who wear burkas to letter boxes.It’s his opinion.You very well might disagree, but getting him to say sorry won’t make him stop thinking such thoughts.He will just stop writing and uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looked pretty amazing to me. Maybe it was luck, I dont know.Harrowing audio revealed the pilot joking with the controllers who begged him to land the 76-seater plane before it nosedived and burst into a fireball 25 miles from takeoff.He also told them he was a broken man and apologised to the air traffic controller, saying: I hope this doesnt ruin your day.At one point, he said: Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot?Astonishing video showed the plane doing large loops and other dangerous manoeuvres.The deadly excitement was clearly far removed from Russells daily grind as a seemingly bored baggage handler.A video he posted on YouTube gave an insight into his work for Horizon Airlines which mainly involved loading and unloading luggage for around £10 an hour.The second half of the two-minute video is devoted to Russells travels, featuring photos and videos from his different trips around the world.During the hijacking Russell, known as Rich, told controllers he wanted to do a barrel roll, and if that goes good... nose down and call it a night.He added: I wouldnt know how to land - I wasnt really planning on landing it.Russell, who dreamed of joining the military, then said that he had thrown up and that he felt dizzy, adding: Im sorry about this, I hope it doesnt ruin your day.Man, the sights went by so fast. I was thinking, like, Im going to have this moment of serenity, take in all the sights. Theres a lot of pretty stuff, but theyre pretty in a different context.Last night his family said they were “devastated” in a short statement. It read: “This is a complete shock to us.“We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now.”It added Russell was a “faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend.”Russell, who ran a bakery with his wife Hannah until it shut down in 2015, crashed on Ketron Island, 30 miles south west of Seattle, at 8pm local time.He met Hannah in 2010 when they were both in school and married her one year later, according to one of his blog posts.In his call to air traffic controllers, the man also described him as having a few screws lose but didnt realise until now.It is still unclear how Russell, who is not believed to have a pilots licence, managed to steal the jet and get it into the air without anyone noticing.Sheriff Paul Pastor confirmed there were no passengers on board the plane and the incident was not terror-related, just a joyride gone terribly wrong.Investigator Eckrote said it was very lucky the plane avoided nosediving into a populated area.Eyewitnesses said they saw the aircraft being followed by military planes and videos of the aircraft flying circuits were posted online.The Pierce County Sheriffs Office said on Twitter the crash may have been caused by the man doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills.Troyer said F-15 aircraft scrambled out of Portland, Oregon, and were in the air within a few minutes and the pilots kept people on the ground safe.The sheriffs department said they were working to conduct a background investigation on the Pierce County resident.It stolen at 8pm, and Alaska Airlines said it was in a maintenance position - meaning it was not scheduled for a passenger flight.Horizon Air is part of Alaska Air Group and flies shorter routes throughout the west of the United States.The Q400 is a turboprop aircraft with 76 seats.Pierce County Sheriff Pastor said the man did something foolish and may well have paid with his life."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426226103.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man goes pint after work wakes up magaluf","story":"Alun Griffiths, 27, received a phone call from his partner who said foods ready as he touched down on the Spanish resort.My Mrs rang me saying where are you?, said Alun, who flew to Palma with pal Nigel Lewis after going for after work drinks on Tuesday.After landing the duo hopped in a taxi and headed to party town Magaluf for a two day bender.He added: I said Im in Magaluf and she said foods ready and I said Im not joking, I wont be home for a few days.She wasnt best pleased.Alun, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, called in at Gurnos Club on his way home from work, planning to have a few drinks with friends.He told Wales Online: I was in work on Tuesday morning and Id woken up in a stupid mood when you just get a feeling youre going to do something stupid.After work I went to the Gurnos Club and there was about 15 of us all talking about holidays.

They were given two Viagra pills every a day for two years.The results showed the drug, which this year became available over the counter in Britain, stopped the condition in its tracks for four participants and significantly improved the eyesight of one.Researchers said: Viagra offers significant potential for vision retention and recovery. It is notable that patients remained visually stable and there was a significant improvement in vision in one participant.Dry AMD, the slow acting form of the disease that takes several years to manifest, affects around 90 per cent of cases in the UK.The rest suffer the more rapid wet AMD, which can cause blindness in as little as three months.Dry AMD usually develops after the age of 50 and is caused by the growth of new blood vessels over the macula, a small oval-shaped area at the back of the eye needed to pick out visual details clearly.Fluid leaks from the blood vessels, causing scar tissue to form and ruin vision in the centre of the eye.Sufferers of the condition find it difficult to read, watch television and even recognise faces.Other research has found that AMD is partyl caused by resduced blood flow to vital parts of eye tissue in front of the retina.The latest results, published in the journal of Ophthalmologica, compliment earlier studies suggested Viagra can improve blood flow.Professor Sobha Sivaprasad from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the Viagra findings were encouraging, although the study was small.We now need bigger studies to replicate these findings before Viagra can be used as a treatment, she cautioned.Some drugs can already slow the progression of AMD and increase vision, but they have to be injected into the back of the eye every month.Viagra cold also help a string of ailments, including heart attacks, lung disease and dementia, previous studies have suggested."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426258559.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"plane passenger fondled airport security search sues","story":"Mark Frey, 61, was heading back to New York from Palm Beach, Florida, with his girlfriend and two young daughters when the incident allegedly happened.He claims he was having a routine pat-down when a screener at Palm Beach International Airport began fondling him.The screener had Frey – who has metal prosthetics in his neck – lift his shirt up to his head and ignored his request for a private search, the lawsuit says.The worker then put his hands under the chiropractor’s shorts and was “roughly touching” his genitals, it is claimed.The groping allegedly went on for so long that his then eight-year-old daughter exclaimed: “Look, they are touching Daddy’s penis!”Irate Frey said: “They took away my child’s innocence.”The search was so out of bounds, a fellow traveller filed her own complaint on behalf of Frey, who pleaded for a supervisor’s help as the invasive procedure dragged on, he alleges.Frey claims screeners working for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) were poorly trained and went too far.He said: “I want it to be a learning moment for everybody, where we can try to lose some of this insanity.”TSA declined comment when contacted by the Post.A version of this story originally appeared on New York Post."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426237489.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum buys christmas presents 9 months early","story":"Paige Ridlings, 21, spent £600 on 40 items for her youngsters, including a trampoline, two kids bicycles and a toy dog that helps children learn to read.Mum-of-two Paige, says she hates rushing around in December and instead prefers to sort the shopping early.She dismissed claims that she spends too much on tots Oscar, two, and 11-month-old Rogan-Leigh, claiming they receive fewer presents on their birthdays.Most gifts cost between £15 and £20, including two bean bags and an assortment of small toys.Paige, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, started shopping in March and has finally finished - four months ahead of schedule.She buys presents from Very using credit and has 12 months to pay it back.

Another firm said it thought claims could double.Trevor Abrahmsohn, of property firm Glentree, warned some homeowners may even have to leave their homes for safety reasons.He said: “Subsidence can be so severe that it has required, in some cases, the complete rebuilding of the property, during which, the homeowner has had to move out of the property and into alternative accommodation while their home is made safe.Subsidence can cost up to £50,000 to fix, however in most cases this cost is covered by buildings insurance, meaning homeowners are spared the bill.Rod Jones, of price comparison website uSwitch, said: “If your house suffers, or has historically suffered from subsidence, it can result in your buildings insurance premium being higher than normal.In some instances, this could even mean an insurer being unwilling to cover your property.”Subsidence occurs when the soil below a property shifts, causing cracks to appear in the walls of the building.During periods of extended hot weather the soil below homes contracts more than normal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can it fly? How did you land it here?We get customers coming all the way from Holland to see it - theyre amazed its just sat in the back of the beer garden.He added: Its honestly the best £100 I have ever spent, and thats not just because of the increase in customers, but weve not stopped working on it since.Paul proudly says the large garden ornament is a real pull with customers at his pub The Standard in Northallerton, North Yorks.Captain Greig, as he is now known by locals, recalls placing the bid just in the nick of time with two minutes left before the auction closed.The band of brothers have spent hundreds of hours doing up the aircraft, working on the project at weekends.Following a painstaking restoration, the plane is now equipped with fully working cockpit and landing lights.Paul said: My garden was the biggest so I decided to put it in - it took just half a day to crane it over from the neighbours yard in four pieces.It all depends on the weather - and while running a pub I usually have my hands full.The plane had been painted over and painted over and we stripped it all back and worked and worked on it.We are all complete amateurs but have a love for aircrafts - its a real hobby and we enjoy working on it.Paul became obsessed with planes after spending his childhood living in a flight path of Edinburgh airport.He says the hardest part of the restoration project is finding parts which now no longer exist.Asked about the hidden secret being unearthed, Paul said: Its funny because its being here all this time and weve never had any publicity until a journalist wandered in and was taken aback.I dont know if it the best - but I cant say I know of any other pubs that have a jet in the beer garden.The jet had flown out of RAF Linton on Ouse in the early 1960s.Before the plane was transported to Pauls pub June 2005, it had spent the last five years in a field alongside other war machines, including at tank, in Sussex.The previous owner had also saved it from scrap when he bought it from a museum in South Wales after it closed.He said: I basically wanted to stop it from being put on the scrap heap and the bloke that was selling it wanted to downsize after his wife had died.Adding: Its a bit of British aviation heritage which I couldnt let go to waste.Jet Provost air-planes were used as jet trainers and Pauls model was built in Luton as an RAF jet trainer.The plane entered service in 1960 at Linton-on-Ouse and was used until 1973."},{"url":null,"title":"saving poundstretcher shows former poundlworld boss explode as hes confronted for wasting 7000 on products from china that are cheaper in uk","story":"Chris Edwards was hired in October to revive the flagging brand which suffered losses of £3.5m loss in 2017 following profits of £3.4m.The 67-year-old sold his business for £150 million in 2015 and was hired by Poundstretcher owner Aziz Tayub to boost sales for struggling stores but was sacked after six months.His time at Poundstretcher, when he was 10th CEO in a decade, was filmed in a Channel 4 documentary.In one scene, Edwards is involved in a heated exchange with Tayubs son Fayaz, who is responsible for company costs.He has spent £7,000 on a delivery of plastic poster covers from China.But Fayaz said the product could have been ordered for around £2,000 cheaper from the companys usual local supplier.He reacts badly, asking Fayaz why he didnt raise the cheaper products to him sooner.“I dont need a lecture from you to say Ive spent 20p on a piece of plastic, no listen to me, listen to me, he says.This can be a deal-breaker, I dont give a f***.Trying to diffuse the situation, Fayaz says: “We can work together Chris, we can work together.”Edwards, however, interrupts, saying: “We can work together but not on these terms.

The findings prompted fresh cross-party calls for a second EU referendum after appearing to show most seats now have a majority of voters who want to stay in.  Among the 112 Westminster seats found to have switched were arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson\u0027s Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Michael Gove\u0027s Surrey Heath. The seats of pro-Brexit Labour MPs Frank Field in Birkenhead and Graham Stringer in Blackley and Broughton also switched, the analysis claimed. The figures were produced by consumer analytics company Focaldata, drawing on two YouGov polls of a total of more than 15,000 people. Scroll down for the full list of 112 seats  They found that 112 out of the 632 seats in England, Scotland and Wales had switched from Leave to Remain since the referendum. These included 97 English seats, 14 in Wales and one in Scotland. Under the Focaldata model, 341 constituencies now have a Remain majority, up from 229 in 2016. The analysis was jointly commissioned by the anti-Brexit Best For Britain campaign and anti-fascist Hope Not Hate campaign, and published in the Remain-backing Observer newspaper. Overall it put Remain on 53% and Leave on 47%.   It claimed the changes were largely driven by growing doubts about the case for Brexit among Labour voters in the north of England and Wales.   That could increase pressure on Jeremy Corbyn as he faces a grassroots bid for Labour to back a second EU referendum at the party\u0027s conference next month.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who spoke at a rally of anti-Brexit People\u0027s Vote supporters in Bristol on Saturday, said: Nearly everyone is disillusioned by the mess the Conservatives have made of Brexit.

I’d spent 13 years as a delivery driver for a local Indian restaurant, and the midnight masalas had really taken their toll, says Pete. When Kathie saw that the tray couldn’t get past my belly, she took my hand and very gently told me she was worried about me. I was bit taken aback, but I knew in my heart of hearts that I couldn’t go on like this. The couple had been together since they’d met at the factory where they worked aged 18. I’d fallen in love with Kathie’s smile the moment I met her, though she hadn’t been impressed by my thick perm, says Pete. But I won her over and we were engaged after nine months, and we had a big white wedding. Thirty years later, I loved her more than ever. After the embarrassing incident on the plane, the couple carried on with their holiday, tucking into treats as normal. But back in the UK Kathie persuaded Pete to join Weight Watchers with her.  We’d been together for 30 years but it hadn’t taken me that long to realise Kathie was always right, says Pete. I couldn’t believe it when I stepped on the scale and saw that I’d ballooned to almost 22 stone. I was mortified, but Kathie was quick to support me. \u0027I love you, we’ll do this together,\u0027 she told me. Over the years, Kathie had gained weight too, and wanted to lose about 5\u0026frac12 stone. When Pete would come home from his nightshift at the Indian, he’d bring back her favourite korma with some onion bhajis. They’d often sit and eat together late at night, with Kathie exhausted from her busy day at the hospital where she worked as a nurse. The weight went on quickly: by the time their daughter Keisha, now 24, was born two years after the wedding, Pete had piled on 3\u0026frac12 stone, and by the time their son Perry, now 21, came along two years after that, Pete was up to 21\u0026frac12 stone. Special occasion Now, they had every reason to want to stay fit and healthy: at 48, they’d just become grandparents for the first time, and had another granddaughter on the way. We both wanted to be around to see them grow up, and knew we needed to start looking after our health more, says Pete. With Kathie by my side, I felt like I could do anything, and we really supported each other through every meal and workout. Pete soon realised just how unhealthy his eating habits had been: alongside the takeaway dinners, he’d have four sandwiches and two packets of crisps for lunch each day, and he could easily clock up an entire day’s worth of calories by indulging in his favourite vintage ciders in the evenings. On Friday nights Pete and Kathie would frequently have friends round and tuck into feasts of Pringles and dips, pizzas, garlic breads, kebabs and huge puddings.  We enjoyed those nights, but once we joined Weight Watchers, we worked out we were eating about 10 days’ worth of food in one sitting, he laughs. Pete and Kathie made healthy changes by switching bread for wraps and filling up on eating more fruit and pulses. After four months Pete had lost 4 stone, and felt fantastic. Although Kathie’s weight loss was a lot slower – she’d lose about 1 pound a week while Pete lost an average of 3\u0026frac12 pounds – she was losing steadily too. With their 25th wedding anniversary coming up, Pete wanted a way to remind Kathie just how much he loved her. I wanted to show Kathie how much I appreciated how supportive she always was, so, in the middle of a family party, I asked her to marry me... again! It was a lovely moment, with the whole family clapping as she hugged me and agreed to renew our vows. Pete booked a surprise holiday to Bulgaria in August 2017, and on their 25th wedding anniversary, the couple renewed their vows in the sunshine at a marina.  I’d lost 8 stone by then, and Kathie had lost 2\u0026frac12 stone. She looked beautiful and when she smiled up at me and said \u0027I do\u0027, I felt like the luckiest man in the world. Back home, the happy couple got straight back on with their diets. But just three months after renewing their vows, Kathie began to experience chest pains. Worried Pete took his wife to the hospital, where Kathie was diagnosed with gallstones that had become infected. After a week in hospital overcoming the infection, Kathie had a routine operation to remove them. I breathed a sigh of relief when she came out of surgery, says Pete. She was still the same old Kathie, although a little weak. I took her home and told her to rest while I busied myself looking after her, ready for our lives to return to normal. Pete cared for Kathie as she got better, encouraging her to put her feet up as he brought her wholesome meals to aid her recovery. She seemed to be getting on well, but just two days after the surgery she collapsed on the way to the bathroom. I was cooking dinner when I heard her call out my name, he remembers. My son Perry and I rushed to her side. I could tell as soon as I reached her that something was wrong, because her voice was slurred. We tried to lift her up, but Kathie simply smiled up at us before passing away in my arms. Frantically, Pete performed CPR on Kathie as they waited for paramedics to arrive, but it was too late – Kathie was gone. Complications from surgery had caused her death aged just 50, and Pete’s world fell apart. We buried her on my 50th birthday, so I could spend one last birthday with her, says Pete. Losing Kathie has rocked the family to the core. Her granddaughters Lola and Willow often ask where their nanny is, and there isn’t a day that goes by that Pete doesn’t feel his loss. But while once he would have turned to familiar, unhealthy foods for comfort, Pete has stuck to his healthy new habits, knowing that it’s what Kathie would have wanted. In the immediate wake of her death, he lost a stone in 10 days, and reached his goal of 13 stone. In her memory It was a bittersweet moment, and Pete asked his Weight Watchers leader to let the occasion pass without a fuss. Normally when a dieter reaches their goal, the whole group will give them a round of applause and a certificate, but Pete couldn’t face it so soon after losing Kathie.

The officer, 37, was off-duty when he rushed to assist a 21-year-old man who was in the process of being robbed of his moped, police say. Unarmed himself, he showed extreme bravery in challenging the suspects, who were on mopeds and allegedly carrying a large knife.  And even when he was stabbed in the leg, he continued to help the victim until the four men fled the scene, according to Scotland Yard. The incident occurred in Lewisham, south London, yesterday evening and the officer \u0027thwarted\u0027 the theft of the moped, the force said.    The unidentified cop was taken to a south London hospital, where his injuries were described as not life-threatening or life-changing. Fortunately, he is now said to be stable and recovering. The victim of the attempted robbery was also assaulted by the group of suspects and suffered bruising, the politan Police said. His injuries are also not life threatening. The stabbing comes amid a knife crime epidemic in the capital, with more than 50 people having been stabbed to death so far this year.

But just over a year after her death, he has hit back at claims he found love again too quickly, insisting: “Emmy wanted me to meet someone.” The 33-year-old artist is now living with Jenna Elsby, also 33, and her four-year-old son Charlie. It is a romance that sparked a backlash from his late wife’s grieving family and followers of her inspirational blog. Emmy’s sister Sophie publicly slammed her brother-in-law for “disrespecting” her sister, who she claimed would be “heartbroken”. But in their first interview, the new couple tell how they felt they were destined to be together.  Jake said: “It’s tough when you get messages from people close to you saying negative things. “But people deal with grief in different ways and those messages were coming from a place of hurt. “I will never personally say anything against Emmy’s family but I did feel let down. I think if I had come out and said I had a girlfriend then, now or even a year from now, it would have been a hard pill for some people to swallow. “Emmy wanted me to be happy. She wanted me to meet someone, she told me that.” The primary school teacher died aged 31 in June 2017, less than a year after their wedding and just 18 months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  In February Jake announced he had abandoned plans to have their baby using her frozen embryos and a surrogate mother after two failed attempts. Three months before that he had accepted an award for Fundraiser of the Year on behalf of Emmy at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain awards. He continues to raise money for the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, by running marathons and it was shortly after the awards that Jenna – a marketing expert and lifestyle writer – got in touch to offer her help. They soon discovered plenty in common. Jenna grew up in Chepstow, south Wales, near Jake in Monmouth. And when Jake worked as a doctor at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Jenna lived just a short walk away with her Australian husband and young son.  “I knew of Jake through a mutual friend at school and I wanted to help so I got in touch and offered him my marketing services,” Jenna said. “I didn’t know much about his story because I’d been living abroad and then in my own merry hell going through a divorce with Charlie’s dad.” During Jenna’s separation from her husband, she lost a friend to suicide and a very close friend to cancer. “It’s something I lived through first hand,” Jenna says. “We were just in a really similar situation. “Bad stuff had happened and we were both a bit war beaten. “But we both have a really similar outlook on life which is it’s about the here and now and looking forward and creating happiness, whatever that means, every day.”  Jenna and Jake began messaging back and forth and arranged a business lunch in London just before Christmas. Jenna said: “We went into that business lunch with professional heads on but the conversations were informal from the get-go. Our pasts were linked. We came away feeling things maybe we shouldn’t have been feeling. “I felt like I’d known Jake my whole life. “Jake is not defined by his past in the same way I’m not defined by mine. There was an obvious connection between us and you have to open your heart to love again. In honour of those who can’t live a life, I know I have a responsibility to make every day count.” Jake said he felt an instant attraction to Jenna and for the first time he could see himself moving forward.  He said: “I absolutely had no intention of meeting anybody at that time. “It was the most unexpected thing. I was just trying to keep my head straight and focused and it was the last thing on my mind. “She walked out of Covent Garden Tube stop and she was all smiles. I fancied her a lot quite quickly. “I didn’t even know I was ready for another relationship until I met Jenna. No one was more surprised than me. “Jenna and Charlie played a huge part in helping me out of a dark place. They brought the sunshine back into my life again. “Towards the end of our first meeting – which ended up lasting about 10 hours – I actually leaned in for a kiss and she gave me a bit of a telling off.” Jenna added: “I liked him a lot. How can you not? He’s delicious. But in that moment I was shocked.”  The couple arranged a proper date and their relationship took off. In February, they jetted to Iceland on their first mini-break. And as Jenna beamed next to a suitcase on the train station platform, Jake snapped a picture, uploaded it to Instagram and made their relationship public. The caption read: “Who’s a lucky boy then?! Escaping again – this time for a few days of R\u0026ampR and a little bit of marathon training to the end of the world with his gorgeous little ragamuffin!” Instantly, hurtful comments came flooding in, slamming Jake and calling Jenna “evil”, a “rebound”, “ugly” and “shameful”.

The high class call-girl has called for more help for the sex workers. Two prostitutes previously admitted they are solely selling themselves to punters to get money for their next hit of crack cocaine or heroin in Birmingham. Rape, robbery and attacks are commonplace for the prostitutes - who admit they sometimes cry while having sex with punters. By comparison the high class call-girl works for a Birmingham agency and enjoys dinner dates with her clients. But she believes some agency girls end up working on the streets because of drugs.  She said: You don\u0027t want to get this reputation as a party girl. If you went on a website or an advert and it said \u0027she\u0027s a party girl\u0027 then that\u0027s a euphemism for \u0027she takes coke, she drinks\u0027. They do well to start with because a lot of the wreck-heads want to see them. They make all their money in less than a year. But because they\u0027ve marketed themselves as a party girl, they are burnt out and they go crazy. She added she has known many attractive girls who worked at the agency with her, but they took too many drugs.  They would have meltdowns and then get sacked, she said. Some were taking so many drugs that their noses were falling out. Then they would start taking harder drugs like heroin and crack - so they get fired. If you\u0027re doing hard drugs, you get sacked. For this reason - and to avoid putting herself in danger - the escort claims she doesn\u0027t touch drugs or drink when with clients. It must be so hard, going on the streets, not wanting to have sex with these people, getting in cars - that is terrifying.   The escort said she believes that none of the street girls does heroin or crack cocaine because they want to, the Birmingham Mail reported .  That\u0027s something you do because you\u0027re in a dark place, she said. They\u0027re just viewed as junkies. But I just feel so bad for them and I am disgusted that men pick them up. They\u0027re obviously not enjoying it and if you don\u0027t enjoy your work, you should not be doing it, because it f**** you up in the head.  It must be so hard, going on the streets, not wanting to have sex with these people, getting in cars - that is terrifying. They could get murdered, because girls do. Although her job pays up to \u0026pound4,000 per week, she insisted she is no different to the street girls. She has sex with around 20% of her customers instead of all of them as working girls do.  I don\u0027t view them as any different, just because I\u0027m priced higher than other escort agencies or other girls, I don\u0027t see myself as any better than anyone else. We\u0027re all doing the same thing, so I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m a princess or anything. They\u0027re doing the same as us, just in a very unsafe way. Another call girl, Danielle, started off at the higher end of the sex industry when she was a teenager.

An influx of Eastern European immigrants from Roma communities who have fled persecution in their native countries are now living in streets around Toxteth, Liverpool.  But their arrival has led to a clash of cultures in the working-class, traditionally ethnically-diverse area, with authorities admitting there are tensions with other residents, the Liverpool Echo reports .  Organisations who work with the Roma community say they are being discriminated against over access to jobs and health, while there are claims private landlords are sub-letting their homes.   Residents claim they can\u0027t sleep because of noisy groups on the street late at night, there have been a number of petty thefts and rubbish is being dumped on the pavements.  They say children as young as THREE are being left to roam the streets alone. One man, Cristian Dutu, said his dog was left dead in the street when he and his mother were attacked by a drunken mob. Mr Dutu, a 27-year-old warehouse worker, said he and mother Mihaela Filip asked the group to stop damaging cars parked near their home overnight on April 21.  But a group of men then climbed onto a wall to attack the pair, leaving them with slash wounds.  During the violence, their bulldog-cross Hindo was picked up by his neck and hurled from their balcony after it tried to get between the family and their attackers.  Six arrests were made that evening and three men remain under investigation.  The incident has left Mr Dutu, originally from Romania, feeling deeply unsettled in the home he has built in the city. Mr Dutu described incidents of anti-social behaviour, vandalism and fly-tipping taking place on almost a daily basis. He said: “Every day something is happening. When I moved onto this street almost seven years ago, I liked it. There was a beautiful community all congregating with each other and living in peace. There were students, people seemed to be happy.” But Mr Dutu said he has seen tensions rise and his neighbours move out since immigration from poorer areas of the European Union rapidly changed the demographics of the area.  He said: “Next-door neighbours have been forced to move away through intimidation with the anti-social behaviour and stuff. House burglaries became an everyday thing. Most people moved away but I feel sorry for the ones that own their house here and can\u0027t sell.” Mr Dutu has called on the authorities to install CCTV and “listen” to the residents who make complaints. As problems in the area continue, people happy in their homes for years are moving out, while others who remain say they experience stressful situations on a daily basis.  Kirk Jones, 43, described Wendell Street as “the fifth circle of hell” and fears his “life is in danger” after a violent incident for which he is also under investigation by police. The professional artist and sculptor found himself in police custody after, in his own words, “snapping” and getting involved in a brawl with a group of men on the morning of July 25. The incident saw Mr Jones arrested on suspicion of affray and racially aggravated assault while two other men were arrested on suspicion of affray. Released under investigation and awaiting a charging decision, Mr Jones told the Echo he is “not proud” of his behaviour but believes he was driven to violence by his living situation.  Mr Jones said on July 25 tensions boiled over when he awoke to loud music coming from a house on the street which he says was a single song playing on repeat over and over again. He opened the door and shouted an obscenity, calling for the occupants to turn down the music, but said no-one appeared to be around and he left to go to a nearby shop. Mr Jones told the Echo as he returned home he was attacked by a group of men and women who punched him and hit him with a pipe until a neighbour intervened. He claimed he fought back to defend himself, before making his way back to his house. However, the artist said the group returned to his house and began banging on the door. Mr Jones said: “I thought I am not going to be intimidated, so like Steven Gerrard said I thought \u0027we go again\u0027.  “I opened the door and said \u0027what do you want?\u0027 and luckily then the police arrived. I have thought about it and I wonder what they came back to do, I feel like my life is in danger.” One resident in nearby Holmes Street, who did not wish to be named, said his neighbours on either side had moved out – with one telling how their letter-box and doorbell being stolen from the front of their house. He said: “One of my neighbours said her son was struggling at school because he could not get to sleep at night. “It\u0027s frustrating. We have met with the councillors and the police but I get the feeling they don\u0027t believe it is that bad.  “A lot of anger is towards the landlords. People believe the houses are being sub-let. The resident, who has owned his home for 14 years and lived there for seven, said he has seen a massive deterioration in the past three or four years.  Merseyside Police told the Echo: We are aware of specific tensions within this area and we work with a lot of agencies to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour including Liverpool Community Safety Team, Landlord Licensing, Environmental Health, education and street services.  Through the summer months of May, June and July, we provided a full partnership week, liaising with all residents, and provided a mobile police station in the area for a different day, for seven weeks.

Thomas Markle Senior, 74, claimed Meghan told him he could not make a speech at her wedding to Prince Harry as there would be “no room” for him at the Windsor Castle extravaganza. Last night her brother Tom Jnr, 51, told the Mirror he feared she has changed since becoming part of the royal family. He said: “Throughout our lives, dad always put Meg first, above me and my sister, but if what he is saying is true it appears she is abusing his love for her.  “It’s selfish, cruel even. He gave her everything and now she is giving him nothing but hurt back. Mr Markle said he was devastated at not even receiving a formal invitation to his daughter’s wedding. He said: “Like any father, I wanted to say a few words. I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: ‘Daddy, I’ve met a man… Daddy, he’s English… Daddy, he’s a prince.’ “I thought it was a cute story. I was going to thank the royal family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. “But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.” His son Tom Jnr said: “They say blood is thicker than water, but perhaps the blue blood of the royals now runs through Meg’s veins. “It’s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family. “Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.” Mr Markle claims his three-month rift with Meghan, 37, began when she told him to stop speaking to his eldest daughter, Samantha, who had publicly criticised her.  He said: “Meghan asked me to tell Samantha to stop talking about her and then asked me to stop talking to Samantha. “I have two daughters. I can’t stop talking to one of them. “No father should be asked to turn his back on their children. I love Meghan but I also love Samantha.” Samantha, 53, last night launched a withering attack on her half-sister for seemingly turning her back on their father. She said: “There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is. “She should be grateful. Her diplomacy skills suck and are inhumane. “If you treat your own father like this, Harry is next.” She added: “Freezing people out is the best way of hiding the truth.” Outspoken Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, ensured her comments were received by courtiers after tweeting her thoughts directly to Kensington Palace. She added: “There is no room for a greedy arrogant, deceitful fake humanitarian on this world stage. How dare she? Disgusting.” Mr Markle’s feud with her deepened, some now say irreparably, when he slammed the phone down on Prince Harry after he was found to have lied to the royal about faking paparazzi pictures before the wedding. The award-winning lighting director said he suffered a heart attack just days before the May 19 wedding after he was exposed the photos for cash.  Though he had never met the Prince, the pair had enjoyed a series of “warm and chatty’” conversations after Meghan told him of her relationship with the royal. During the talks, they discussed how best to handle news of their romance when it became public. The Prince stressed that he should avoid the paparazzi at all costs. “Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears,” Mr Markle explained. “He said, ‘They will eat you alive.’ He was right.” But Mr Markle ignored his advice and, on the advice of Samantha, entered into a deal with a British photographer. Together they faked four sets of pictures of him reading a book on Britain, working out on an exercise bike, being measured for a suit and surfing the internet looking at pictures of his daughter. The sets are said to have earned \u0026pound100,000, with Mr Markle taking a small cut. A fifth set, of the pensioner at the home of his ex, Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland, was scuppered when other photographers happened to be at the property when he delivered flowers to her. Following the publication of the pictures Harry, 33, had grown suspicious and challenged Mr Markle over their authenticity. Mr Markle reassured Harry they were genuine pictures and he had not colluded with the paparazzi. It led to a statement being made by Kensington Palace through the press watchdog asking for the pensioner’s privacy to be respected. But less than 48 hours later, Mr Markle was exposed when CCTV footage of him setting up the pictures with a British paparazzi emerged. Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from the heart attack. Harry told him: “If you had listened to me this would never have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man goes pint after work","story":"NewsMan goes for pint after work - and wakes up in MAJORCA (and his partner isn\u0027t too happy)Alun Griffiths, 27, from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, says he received a phone call from his partner saying \"food\u0027s ready\" shortly after touching down on the Spanish islandShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByChristie Bannon19:19, 11 AUG 2018Updated09:54, 12 AUG 2018NewsAlun Griffiths (left) and Nigel Lewis flew to Palma after going for a drink at a Welsh pub (Image: Alun Griffiths)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young British man has revealed how he went for a pint after work - only to awake in Majorca hours later with his pal.

He added: And I said \u0027I\u0027m in Magaluf\u0027 and she said \u0027food\u0027s ready\u0027 and I said \u0027I\u0027m not joking, I won\u0027t be home for a few days\u0027. She wasn\u0027t best pleased. Alun, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, had called in to the Gurnos Club on his way home from work on Tuesday, Wales Online reports.  He intended to simply have a few drinks with his friends - but he didn\u0027t end up getting home for another two days. He admitted he had woken up that day in a stupid mood. I was in work on Tuesday morning and I\u0027d woken up in a stupid mood when you just get a feeling you\u0027re going to do something stupid, he said. After work I went to the Gurnos Club and there was about 15 of us all talking about holidays. So I said \u0027anyone want to go on holiday now? Let\u0027s go up the airport and see where we can go anywhere in the world\u0027. Alun travelled to Cardiff Airport with Nigel, where they were told that they could book on to a flight that evening going to Palma. During the journey, they fell asleep - only to wake up in the Spanish resort.  After touching down in the city, they shared a taxi with some men outside the airport to nearby Magaluf. There\u0027s a Palma in Italy too so we didn\u0027t know if we were going to the one in Spain or Italy, Alun added. We fell asleep on the plane and woke up in Spain - thank God. With no hotel and no return flight home booked, the pair headed straight out until the early hours of the morning. They then continued to drink - but booked a hotel for that night. The first night we stopped drinking at 5.30am, Alun said.  The next morning we kept drinking right through and booked a hotel for the Wednesday night, had a sleep for an hour and carried on and came back on Thursday. He added: When we got back we went back to the Gurnos Club - it was crazy. They had all said it\u0027s a stupid idea but because we actually went and broke the routine, when we were out there they were all saying \u0027we\u0027re trying to book flights out there\u0027.

She spent \u0026pound600 on items for Oscar, two, and 11-month-old Rogan-Leigh to avoid the stress of last-minute buying. Full-time mum Paige, who bought 40 items, said she likes to stay ahead of the game to avoid rushing around at the last minute. She also dismissed suggestions she spends too much on her young children - because they will receive fewer presents on their birthdays. The 40 items include a \u0026pound120 trampoline, a trike for babies priced at \u0026pound95, a small bicycle costing \u0026pound40 and a toy dog which helps children learn to read at \u0026pound30.

Paige, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, buys the presents off Very using credit and has 12 months to pay it back. She has already paid back \u0026pound400. Paige said: “I find it so much easier to shop like this because there\u0027s no rushing around - and I can make sure my boys have stuff they have asked for. “I used to leave Christmas shopping to the last minute. “It was so stressful because it would be hard to find some toys because they\u0027d be out of stock and near Christmas time shops are always busy - buying early doesn\u0027t have that stress.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles dad never even","story":"NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s dad \u0027never got INVITE to royal wedding\u0027 despite 600 others receiving oneThomas Markle says he would have loved to have framed one of the ornate formal invitations sent out ahead of the wedding on May 19Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans17:50, 12 AUG 2018Updated18:02, 12 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle\u0027s dad has sensationally claimed he never received an invite to his daughter\u0027s wedding - despite 600 others getting one.  Thomas Markle says he would have loved to have framed one of the ornate formal invitations sent out ahead of the royal wedding in May.  Hundreds of lucky guests received an invite for Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials, crafted by London-based Barnard and Westwood.  The specially-commissioned invitations were issued under Prince Charles\u0027s name for the service at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle.  Guests were also invited to a subsequent lunchtime reception.  But Mr Markle, 74, claims he wasn\u0027t among those who got an invite.  He told the Mail on Sunday: I never got a wedding invitation.  At first I thought, \u0027That\u0027s OK, because I\u0027m part of the wedding\u0027, but I would have loved to have had an invitation to put in a frame. He added: I asked Meghan to send invitations to all my family. I told her they wouldn\u0027t be able to come because they would never be able to afford the flight but that it would be a nice gesture on her part. Of course that didn\u0027t happen.   The dad also revealed how he had planned to give a speech at the wedding on May 19 - but was told there was \u0027no room\u0027 for it.  He claimed he was told to talk to Meghan after asking his then-future son-in-law Harry whether he could say a few words And when he spoke to his US former actress daughter, 37, he was apparently told that he wouldn\u0027t be able to deliver his speech. He told the newspaper not being allowed to give a speech hurt him. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly wants time apart from her father after he gave a string of media interviews against Palace wishes.  The pair are thought to have not spoken since the wedding almost three months ago, which was watched by millions across the world. Mr Markle has bemoaned the state of his relationship with his daughter and made several public pleas for her to get in touch. But, despite crisis talks with royal officials, Meghan is reportedly not falling for his \u0027crocodile tears\u0027 and is not ready to make contact. The Sun on Sunday quoted a source as saying: Meghan loves Thomas and does want to maintain a relationship with him in the long run. But at the moment she feels he needs a bit of space.

Age UK has decided to offer guidance as more and more people over 60 undergo transition. Britain’s biggest charity for elderly people usually helps pensioners fight loneliness or to claim the winter fuel allowance. But now they have just released a report aimed at assisting older people who are looking to change sex and adjust to their new way of life. It gives advice on financial implications, employment rights and other types of discrimination, including hate crime. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “For a significant but unknown number of older people in our society the revolution we are seeing in public attitudes is immensely meaningful and they deserve our full support and respect.  “Many will have felt the need to conceal or suppress this crucial part of their identity all their lives, for fear of discrimination, ridicule or abuse, so this cultural change is both wonderful and long overdue. “It potentially offers these older people the opportunity to be truly themselves at last. “The last thing they need now is to be subject to ageism. “They are entitled to exactly the same access to advice, information, support and NHS treatment as everyone else to help them make the best decisions for themselves about their identities and about whether they wish to seek gender reassignment and indeed go ahead with it. “Age must not be a barrier in any of these respects.” The report explains some of the advantages of changing sex in later life: “It can be an opportunity to resolve longstanding conflicts and uncertainties that threaten mental health and wellbeing. “There may be fewer social and economic impacts when work or social responsibilities change in retirement.” Labour MP Luke Pollard welcomed the advice. He told the Mirror: “This is a great idea by Age UK to provide such a report. “It doesn’t matter what age you are if you want to change gender. “This report gives sensible advice to older people wanting to make the change. “I welcome any information that is made available to help people make such an important decision.” NHS Digital has revealed the number of people aged 60 and over who have undergone gender reassignment surgery is rising, although the numbers remain small. The debate around gender dysphoria, a condition in which a person feels distress because of a mismatch between their identity and their biological sex, has focused until now on children who want to change sex before or during puberty.  However the Age UK report highlights the dilemmas facing older people, such as having to tell a lifelong partner you believe you have been living in the wrong body. It also gives advice to the partners of those who are transitioning and warns: “Watching what is happening to your loved one as they come to terms with their gender issues can be challenging, whether or not they decide to pursue transition.” Many trans people and their partners remain in settled, happy relationships, the guidance adds, “but you may feel a sense of loss, confusion, anger or hurt. It can affect your sense of who you are. For example if you were a loving wife to a man, do you become the lesbian partner of a woman?” The guidance and report were launched to coincide with a consultation on changes to the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to change gender. According to NHS Digital, eight people aged 60 and over had gender reassignment surgery in 2008-9, which increased to 11 in 2015-16, the last year that figures broken down by age are available. The figures show that in the seven years to 2015-16 a total of 75 people aged between 61 and 71 had the operation and seven people aged 71 and over. Ruth Rose had a sex change at 81 Ruth Rose, 85, is a former RAF navigator. She has known since she was nine years old that she wanted to be a woman and had a sex change operation when she was 81. At the time in an interview with our sister paper the Sunday People she said: “I’m enjoying the fact that I have made the transition. “My main thing in life isn’t going around saying I am a lady now. “But not a day had gone by since I was nine when I didn’t think I was in the wrong body. I always felt I was a woman.” She took a psychiatric assessment to test her suitability to be the oldest British male to undergo gender reassignment surgery. She did not have to wait long for a decision. She said: “After five minutes, they said we have a 40-minute interview, but you’re through in five minutes. What are we going to talk about?’ It was just a doddle for me. Rose has known since she was a nine-year-old boy called James that she wanted to be female. When she finally had the surgery she achieved “total acceptance” as female. “My friends don’t think of me as ever having been male.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ordinary looking pub incredible attraction","story":"NewsOrdinary-looking pub has incredible attraction in the beer gardenLandlord Paul Greig went to incredible lengths to get the retired plane - a 1966 Jet Provost T Mark Three - set up in his beer gardenShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByPaul Byrne16:57, 12 AUG 2018Updated17:02, 12 AUG 2018NewsPaul Greig proudly poses with his plane (Image: SWNS - LEEDS SWNS)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pub landlord is pulling in the punters after landing a 30ft vintage jet for his beer garden.

Chloe Wilson, 22, has suffered from crippling stomach cramps since being a teenager and no drugs had eased her pain. She was only diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a long-term condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed, last March. The young woman was days away from death when she bravely opted to have her entire colon removed as she believed it was her only real chance at having a future. But she was devastated when a nurse allegedly told her she should rethink her decision. She allegedly went on to warn Chloe that she would ‘never be able to wear pretty bikinis like her friends’ as her colostomy bag would be on show.  Thankfully the nurse\u0027s alleged comments didn’t change her mind and when surgeons opened her colon they released it was so diseased she was only days from the organ failing completely.  Chloe, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, is now sharing her story to show others that colostomy bags do not need to hold you back and she is in fact still able to wear bikinis and sports clothing for pole fitness. She says she wears her bag with pride because it saved her life.  The hairdresser said: I\u0027d been in hospital for five weeks when the nurse came over and asked if I was sure about my decision as I\u0027d never be able to wear a bikini like my friends. I was already upset as I was in so much pain but her comments made things so much worse. It was lucky I hadn\u0027t listened to her as surgeons warned that if I\u0027d left things for much longer that it could have been fatal. I\u0027d been in agony since I was 13 years old but doctors thought I was lactose intolerant. It was only when I collapsed from pain last March that I finally got the answers I desperately needed.  She added: I\u0027m so lucky to have survived and I can finally pursue my passion for pole fitness. Before surgery I was too ill to be able to endure high levels of exercise and if I\u0027d not had the surgery when I did, doctors said I wouldn\u0027t be here today. I\u0027m so happy I didn\u0027t listen to the nurse who tried to put me down. I wear pretty bikinis with pride and there\u0027s no reason why I can\u0027t, it\u0027s good to be different.

Cuts in smoking cessation services have been blamed for the rise, which puts more women at risk of miscarriage and endangering their baby’s health. NHS Digital data shows 10.8% of women were smokers at the time of delivery in 2017/18, up from 10.7% the year before. It marked a halt in progress that had seen rates fall from 15.8% a decade earlier towards a target of 6%.  There is a bigger problem in the North, with 16.1% of mums-to-be smoking in Lancashire and 15.8% in the North East, but just 5% in London. The Tories cut England’s public health budget by \u0026pound200million in 2015/16 and it will fall a further \u0026pound331million by 2021. Theresa May has excluded public health from her pledge of new NHS money. Sharon Hodgson, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Public Health, said: “The Government must prioritise public health and make sure high quality, well resourced local services are available.”  Hazel Cheeseman, of the ASH charity, said: “The failure to support mums-to-be to quit puts babies’ lives at risk.” The British Lung Foundation said the number of quitting aids prescribed in England had fallen 75% since 2005. Spokeswoman Alison Cook said: “The Government must act urgently.”  Public Health Minister Steve Brine said the Tories were “determined” to cut rates of smoking in pregnancy to 6% by 2022.

A yellow alert for thunderstorms has been put in place for the East Midlands, the East of England, North East England and Yorkshire from 11am today until 10pm tomorrow. Heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected to become more widespread on Monday afternoon as Storm Debby batters parts of the country. Downpours could see 20 to 30 mm of rain - but the rain is bringing some much-needed relief to parts of southern and central England, which have spent the equivalent of around two months of 2018 without any recorded rainfall. There is a small chance this could cause flooding in some areas, although no flood warning has been released. High spring tides could also threaten floods on coasts on Monday.  Weather forecasters say the dramatic weather could cause power cuts and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions as well as train and bus cancellations. The stormy weather will move to the east of of the country on Monday with the same risks and is expected to continue with heavy rain on Wednesday. But despite the deluge, temperatures have still remained a muggy 20c. And although the unsettled weather is expected to continue with heavy rain on Wednesday, there is still hope for more sun this summer.  But the weather is expected to bounce back with a 12-day sizzle from Friday nudging 30C (86F) up to the Bank Holiday weekend. Forecaster said drier conditions and highs up to 27C are due Tuesday and Wednesday in the South. The Met Office said Thursday sees rain - but hotter and drier conditions are due from Friday in the South and from Sunday in the North, with heat lasting through the following week for the August Bank Holiday weekend on August 25-27.

Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “We’ve been spoilt in recent weeks – but summer isn\u0027t finished. “The weather settles down on Friday in the South and looks likely to to so more widely from the weekend, with promising conditions through the week and for the Bank Holiday weekend. 30C is possible.”  Mr Petagna also said: “This weekend isn\u0027t good for holidays – but there are promising signs of a return to summery weather from Friday and next weekend onwards. “The remnants of ex-Tropical Storm Debby were mixed up in low pressure bringing rain in the West on Saturday and to all areas on Sunday, when rain could be especially heavy in the South.

Charging more when trains fail to turn up, or are late, crowded and dirty doesn’t add up for \u0026shylong-suffering passengers, who on many routes deserve to pay less. Linking fares to the Retail Prices Index is also unfair when most of what the Government pays out is tied to the lower Consumer Prices Index. If the RPI is 3.5% then most travellers would suffer a drop in living standards as earnings are not going up at that rate.  Public support for Labour’s rail renationalisation plan will only strengthen when the Tories and private firms are taking millions of us for an unaffordable ride. Rail should be a public service, not a heavily subsidised source of profits for transport companies, including those owned by foreign governments. Instead of increasing prices, let’s freeze fares and then return this fragmented industry to public ownership and order. Quit’s a must Smoking during pregnancy jeopardises the health and lives of babies as well as mothers, so the increase – blamed on Tory austerity – must set alarm bells ringing. Cutting help-to-quit services is both dangerous and short-sighted when the human and financial cost of tobacco-related illnesses to the NHS are considerable.

Dramatic CCTV footage showed the terrifying ordeal where the defenceless victim was ambushed by the group after she parked up outside her home in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport.  As the woman got out of her convertible Audi A3 she was confronted by a man brandishing a large blade.   He held it to her throat and demanded she hand over her car keys, the Manchester Evening News reported .   The victim did as she was ordered and the men fled the scene in her vehicle along with two other dark-coloured cars.  Security footage, posted on Facebook by the victim, shows her terrifying ordeal unfold on Lawnhurst Close just after 1.30am on Wednesday morning.   Police are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.  They described one of the suspects as black, skinny and around 5ft 8in tall. He was wearing dark clothes, gloves and a balaclava. The man who was armed with the machete is also of skinny build. He too was wearing dark clothes, gloves and a balaclava.  Detective Sergeant Lisa McGrane, of GMP’s Stockport borough, said: “Although the woman was not physically injured, she has understandably been left shaken by what happened. “Nobody should be subject to such a terrifying ordeal right outside their own home and we are determined to find the people responsible for this. “I am appealing to members of the public to please contact police with any information you might have about this incident.” Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 9790 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

We may hear stories about them from old pals, or uncover a hidden treasure, and these things can make the heartbreak of mourning a little easier. But a group of sisters got a little more than they bargained for when they found some of their late mum\u0027s old letters and decided to read them. They found a bunch of letters their dad had sent her when he was working away in London in the 1960s.  The sisters gathered together to read them, but it turns out they weren\u0027t the romantic love notes they were hoping for.  One of the women shared the story on Twitter under the name Morven, writing: After my Mum died we found letters, tied in a bow from my Dad from when he worked away in London in the 60\u0027s.  My crying sisters and I held hands, opened one and the whole thing was about how much he missed shagging her, apparently a bit of a goer. Didn\u0027t read the rest. Wow, just wow. Her tweet has been liked more than 6,000 times and she\u0027s been inundated with messages from people who loved the story.    When one person suggested she must at least be happy to know there was passion in their relationship, the woman replied: Um, kinda. We already knew they were in love and all that but seeing sexual acts that you Mum has performed on your Dad written down is another kettle of fish. One man shared a similar situation he found himself with his parents. He wrote: My mum\u0027s stuff included a bundle of letters labelled To be destroyed when I pop my clogs. My brother took a lot of persuading that she meant To be destroyed *unread*..., and that we should honour the spirit rather than the letter of the request.

Urban explorer Rosie Boulton, 19, had seen ghostly orbs before, but nothing like what she discovered at an abbey in Wales. Travelling to several haunted locations a week, Rosie is constantly on the road snapping pictures of ruins at night.  Whist photographing Tintern Abbey at night, Rosie and friends didn\u0027t find anything unusual , apart from feeling creeped out whilst at the location.  However, when Rosie returned home and looked at the images, she spotted the \u0027ghostly figure\u0027 her camera had captured. The \u0027hooded figure\u0027 can be seen in the photographs standing in front of the ruins.  Having always believed in ghosts and the paranormal, she couldn\u0027t believe her luck and can\u0027t wait to visit the location again. Rosie, from Stanford Bridge, Worcs, said: I get an adrenaline rush, especially when it\u0027s dark because it sets that eerie vibe. I felt okay at the beginning but it was a huge place which made it feel a little more spooky.  You\u0027re not supposed to go there at night. We felt like someone was coming towards us so we all ran out as we were scared. I didn\u0027t know about the ghost of the monk until I got home and looked back at the pictures. I was on my own going through the photos and it just freaked me out. I called my friends and told her about the photos straight away. Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire, stands by the River Wye and it was founded by the Cistercian monks in 1131 AD and was the only the second Cistercian foundation in Britain - the first in Wales.

A total of 17 holidaymakers on the Greek party island were left seriously ill after being given cheap methanol instead of proper alcohol on nights out. Jack Taylor, a business studies student, said holiday reps had warned them about some bars in the town of Laganas so they avoided those. He was away with seven other friends from Coventry and all of them ended up in hospital. We were violently ill, he told the Sun Online. It could have killed us. All were taken to hospital after becoming unwell and had to go to UK hospitals after flying back home.  Methanol is a cheap chemical used to make car anti-freeze. Rogue bar owners in Greece have been known to use \u0026shymethanol, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol, as an alcohol substitute to disguise the fact that drinks have been \u0026shywatered down. The clear fluid, often used in products such as anti-freeze and paint stripper, attacks the optic nerve.

return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the squad.After almost a month out, though, it may be the best he can

is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart Murdoch or Callum Booth or Billy King,” he said.“You should not just be

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things.

He is also in contention to start this afternoon against Dundee at Dens Park.The former Wigan man had a strong finish to last season, starting in the Reds’ last four post-split fixtures.He admits that at this early stage in his Aberdeen career he did not expect to play quite so much. Cosgrove feels he is improving with every game but reckons the Red Army have yet to see his best form – and he is keen to show it in the weeks ahead.He said: “The game time I’ve been getting is absolutely invaluable to me for my performance and development.“It’s exactly what I want to be doing and the calibre of games we’ve been playing in will be nothing but good for me personally.“I think it would be naive to say I expected to play as much as I have but I definitely knew that I could it’s early in my time here but there’s no point in just plodding along and getting the odd game.“I wanted to come here and really stamp my authority and I think I have done. It’s just getting to that next level – whether that’s goals, assists or high-quality performances, I feel I need to kick on.“I do feel there is more to come because I’m learning every game and getting better. The things you learn aren’t always obvious but there’s little things you pick up in games, like where to buy fouls and places to get free from defenders. Everything is adding up but I am still learning.“It does always play (not scoring) on your mind because as a striker it’s my main job, to score. But there’s a lot of work that goes under the radar, like working off the ball and holding up play and things that are vital for the team.“It’s the final piece, whether it’s an assist or a goal, that does get noticed and I’m just trying as hard as I can to do it all. I’m hoping the goals will come and once I get the first one, I’m hoping I can get more.”Cosgrove is also looking forward to savouring the moment of netting his first competitive goal for the Dons. He added: “It will be massive for me because it’s my job to score. Part of it will feel normal, but getting your first goal for a club is always special.”Ahead of today’s game against Dundee, Cosgrove says the Dons have a point to prove after what he feels was a below-par performance in the 1-1 draw with 10-man Rangers on Sunday.He said: “We’re disappointed with the performance on Sunday. But we’ve come away with a point and it does feel like a good point given the circumstances. Last week was the weeks we want to be playing in. We had a tough game down at Turf Moor against Burnley and then there was no better game than Rangers to come back to at Pittodrie.“As tough as it was, we were massively looking forward to it and they are the games we want to be playing week in and week out.“Now, though, the main focus is on Dundee and we’re looking forward to getting going again because we’ve got a point to prove, performance-wise.“We’ve had a good week’s training, we’re feeling and looking sharp so hopefully we can take that into the game. There’s been excuses about tiredness on Sunday but, as a team and a club, the performance wasn’t up to standard at all.“The Rangers game was massively disappointing but the belief is still there within the squad that there’s a lot more to come. Everyone has blips but we’ll bounce back and get the performances we need.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/SKIPPY-SKATEBOARD-940x362.jpg

These included a small play area, a communal seating area and raised beds in which vegetables could be grown.The Seaton Backies committee, Aberdeen City Council communities team and other partners met after the most recent consultation event in May, and it was decided that a play park would be reintroduced.Plans are now being tendered for installing the equipment.Councillor Ross Grant, who represents the Tillydrone, Seaton and Old Aberdeen ward, said: “This step is a significant one for the project and for the community as a whole. It’s a great step forward.“Before the Seaton Backies project began, it was a very unwelcoming space for people who wanted to use it.“The project is a great example of community vision and of a quality partnership between the administration and its constituents.”The Seaton Backies project was started by a group of mums, who wanted to make a difference in their neighbourhood and to ignite community spirit, while ensuring their children could have a safe place to play.The communal plot of land lay in the shadow of Seaton’s high-rise flats and was not viewed as a welcoming environment for use by families.Since launching, the committee has already had several spaces revamped and turned into new play areas.As well as the park, there are two new large spaces across two sites at the Backies that require further development.Councillors unanimously agreed to demolish more wash houses last year, which was expected to cost around £102,000.The Seaton communities team has appealed for as many residents as possible to take part in the scheme so they can get a more complete picture of what people would like.Anyone who wants to get involved, or would like to help make a difference in the Seaton area, is asked to contact Graham Donald, community development worker at Aberdeen City Council, on 01224 277928.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/EE2_Mrs-Murrays-6Aug-03.jpg-467x564.jpg ","title":"can you give one of these pets a new home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

This was the first confirmed breeding attempt of cranes in Scotland for over 400 years.“Even better, this pair decided to make the area their permanent summer residence (they migrate somewhere warmer for the winter), and returned this year for their seventh nesting attempt.“I’ve been lucky enough to have been involved in monitoring their colonisation since that first chick fledged, initially as a volunteer and then as part of my role as RSPB Scotland’s assistant conservation officer.”Amanda has also described the challenges she has faced in keeping track of the birds’ movements – including remaining undetected by them while being close enough to continue to watch their progress.She said: “You may be thinking ‘how hard can it be to monitor a couple of pairs of noisy four-foot-tall birds?’, but the answer is actually ‘pretty difficult’.“They are very sensitive to disturbance, particularly at the nest, so we must keep a good distance away, and they usually manage to find a dip in a field to hide in, a straw bale or just stay far off the beaten track to evade detection.“Even armed with six years of data on habitat preferences throughout the season, and knowledge of their preferred feeding areas, cranes can be really hard to find.“During the few years when we could almost see the nest of pair one from a distant vantage point, we saw that the off-duty bird would spend a lot of time standing near to the nest, whilst the other bird was incubating the eggs.“A single bird would only occasionally fly off on a feeding trip and then return to the nest area an hour or so later, perhaps changing over with the incubating bird, which could then go off foraging, never leaving the precious eggs unattended.”Despite the success of the project, the RSPB is hoping to keep the exact location of the cranes private.This is due to the bird’s “sensitive nature and hyper-awareness” to any disturbance which may lead to the birds abandoning their nests in the north-east.Hywel Maggs, senior conservation officer, added: “We have been working with local farmers, landowners and the community to monitor these fantastic birds each year since 2012. Volunteers have helped us follow each breeding attempt as closely as possible.“We’ve experienced exciting highs, such as the fledging of twins last year, and saddening lows, such as the loss of an adult and chick in 2016 from the same family. Despite their size and flamboyant breeding displays, cranes are secretive birds and are very sensitive to disturbance and we ask that they be given space and peace so they may establish a breeding population in Scotland.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east youngsters create artwork for building equipment to raise cash for charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSchool pupils have created artwork for a piece of building equipment to raise awareness – and money – for a north-east cancer charity.Four designs by the youngsters will adorne a new suction excavator for civil engineering firm Nicol of Skene, which has been dubbed the Anchorator.Every time the Anchorator is hired, Nicol of Skene will make a donation to Friends of ANCHOR.The winning submissions were made by Lexi Morrison, P5 at Crombie School, Beth Pirie, P4 at Skene School, Jesika Rupinska, P6 at Westhill School, and Niamh Kavanagh, P1 at Elrick School.Sarah-Jane Hogg, fundraising and development director for Friends of ANCHOR, said: “We are delighted to have the support of NIcol of Skene through the Anchorator design campaign.“Choosing the winners was not an easy task but it was wonderful to see the effort put into the designs by local schoolchildren.“Every time the Anchorator is out and about it will be raising valued awareness of the charity and contributing to the cause.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tourism groups new map features best north east gardens","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA garden tourism group is to create a map marking the best green areas in the north-east.Discover Scottish Gardens has launched the printed map of Scotland to encourage locals and tourists to visit gardens across the country.Of the 130 gardens featured on the map, eight hail from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire including Haddo House, Crathes Castle, Drum Castle, Castle Fraser and Pitmedden Gardens.According to the Moffat Centre’s Scottish Visitor Attraction Monitor 2017, visits to Scottish gardens increased 10.9% from 2016-17.Research also highlights there are more opportunities to grow the number of international visitors, which currently make up only 6% of garden visitors to Scotland annually.Chairwoman of Discover Scottish Gardens Catherine Erskine said: “Our brand new map of Scotland will help locals and tourists discover the beautiful and varied gardens the north-east has to offer.\u0026#8220We want people to be inspired by Scotland’s breathtaking scenery and learn more about our diverse climate and plant collections that thrive here.“Scottish gardens are a huge asset and we continually strive to maximise on the potential to grow their popularity.“The new map will equip visitors with a list of some of the best gardens in the region, helping them make the most of their visit, or for locals, discover something new right on their doorstep.

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

But it boils down, he said, to one thing: \u0026#8216RBS has a social responsibility and they are abdicating that responsibility in proposing to close the Inveraray branch.\u0026#8217Argyll and Bute MP Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara questioned the customer usage figures used by RBS to justify the closure proposals, adding: \u0026#8216We have to remember that many people rely on face-to-face dealings with their bank businesses with cash to deposit, the elderly, those with learning difficulties and those with no access to online banking facilities at all.\u0026#8217A Johnston Carmichael spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We will be reviewing the usage of each branch on its own merits and then providing RBS with a recommendation on whether we consider each branch should remain open or be closed.\u0026#8217Write to:The RBS review team, Johnston Carmichael LLP, 29 Albyn Place, Aberdeen AB101YLor complete a questionnaire at www.jcca/rbsbranchreviewor email rbsbranchreview@jcca\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"late inveraray surge leaves islanders sweating","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/08/18, 7:14 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Bute 3 Inveraray 2Bute saw off a late fight-back from the Inveraray second team to win at the Meadows.With Gregor Mather missing for Inveraray and Graham MacPherson serving the second of a two-match suspension, Kieran Kirkhope provided cover in goals.The sun was shining as the hosts drew first blood, punishing the Inveraray defence for not dealing with a routine corner. The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours. Please provide as much information as you can about the exact location of the items found to aid the disposal process. “In relation to private ground, the responsibility for disposal lies with the land owner. If you find a needle or syringe on your own property you should always exercise caution and follow advice regarding their safe removal. “Wear heavy duty gloves, use tongs or tweezers to pick up the item and put the item in a suitable container, like a metal tin, a hard plastic tub or empty water bottle, always with a lid. Cleansing Services at Western Road, Kilmarnock will dispose of the container safely for you please do not put it in your refuse bin. “Advice on reporting sharps finds and safe disposal advice can be found at - http://eac.eu/needles.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugs CrimeCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonSchoolsUniversities and CollegesEducationAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"400-boost-for-green-fingered-galaleans","story":"GALA in Bloom has been given a \u0026pound400 boost \u0026ndash thanks to a local bakery.\nAlex Dalgetty \u0026amp Sons collected donations from customers to help the volunteer gardeners maintain Bank Street Gardens.\nThis is the second time in three years the business has raised money for the group.\nAnd recently a cheque was presented to Judith Cleghorn, chairwoman of Galashiels Community Council, by Isobel Redpath.\nThe gardening group, which meets every Thursday morning, looks after Old Gala House Gardens, Focus, station platform, Queen\u0026rsquos Garden, Gala Aisle and Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Brae during the summer as well as litter picking in numerous areas of the town during winter months.\nIf you would like to get involved, contact 753785.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lauders-turn-to-dress-to-impress","story":"LAUDER Common Riding will host its annual Fancy Dress competition tonight.\nChildren\u0027s judging will begin at 6.15pm at The Avenue, while the adults will follow at 6.45pm.\nAnd locals will be able to cheer the contestants on during the parade \u0026ndash which will be led by Stow Pipe Band from 8pm.\nThere\u0027s still plenty more to come from Lauder\u0027s big week....\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s happening from tomorrow:\nThursday:\nA children\u0026rsquos show, organised by Lauder Play Club, takes place in the Public Hall from 2pm.  \nThe Preliminary Ride Out will also be held \u0026ndash leaving The Avenue at 6.15pm.\u0026nbsp  \nFriday:\nThe duck race is set for 2pm on Friday at Thirlestane Castle car park.  \nAnd at 7.30pm the Nicht Afore the Morn \nConcert\nwill be held at Lauder Primary School.  \nThen it\u0026rsquos on to the big day on Saturday...\nIt all kicks off with the Cornet\u0026rsquos March at 7am.\nThe presentation of the Burgh Standard to the Cornet is at 8am and the riders will arrive at the Waterin\u0026rsquo Stane at around 9.50am.\nThis is followed by the War Memorial, memorial service (11.30am approx) and the Bussin\u0026rsquo of the Cornet\u0026rsquos Colours by Lady Busser at noon in the Town Hall.\nThe Party in the Garden will held at 3pm at the Lauderdale Hotel and Dancing in the Street will take place at 5pm.\nThe week will draw to a close with the Common Riding Ball (7.30pm for 8pm) in the marquee in the Public Park and the Grand March, which is set for 9pm.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"33-scottish-borders-addresses-red-flagged-by-ambulance-crews","story":"AMBULANCE crews are being prevented from entering 33 addresses in the TD postcode area unaccompanied, amid fears for their safety, it has been revealed.\nThe 33 Borders homes have been \u0026lsquored flagged\u0026rsquo as being unsafe \u0026ndash which means paramedics can only go in to respond to a 999 call when there is a police officer present to help protect them.\nThe figures, released through a Freedom of Information request to the Scottish Conservatives, showed there were more than 2,500 addresses across Scotland that are deemed unsafe.\nThe TD postcode is commonly known as the Galashiels area, but covers most of the Scottish Borders.\nEttrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire MSP Rachael Hamilton (Cons) said: \u0026ldquoParamedics already have to put up with a lot during their working hours when they have to respond to people with devastating injuries or even worse.\n\u0026ldquoIt is sickening that there are so many Borders addresses that are deemed too unsafe to attend with police protection.\n\u0026ldquoIt has always baffled me as to why people attack those who are trying to help.\n\u0026ldquoI want to see tougher action from the courts when people have assaulted or threatened paramedics, or indeed any member of the emergency services.\n\u0026ldquoLike us all, they should be able to attend their place of work without fear.\nLauderdale and Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame (SNP) said: \u0026ldquoI deplore any aggression towards our emergency services which deal with the most difficult and at times the most tragic of circumstances.

become even trickier.\nMislabelling several years ago led to the Abies koreana being planted in the wrong place at Dawyck Botanic Garden, near Stobo.\nAnd as it gradually approached full height experts realised it was the odd one out when compared with its neighbours on the hillside gardens.\nAhead of the busy autumn period at Dawyck the arborists decided a new location was needed for the

tasks.\n\"The tree in question, an Abies koreana or Korean fir, is one of a very handsome species occurring naturally in the higher mountains of South Korea at altitudes of around 1500 metres.\n\"The

one out.\n\"In order to clear up the issue of it being in the wrong place we took the decision to move it somewhere more appropriate.\"\nHaving now been replanted in a more appropriate location with

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-and-crusaders-chase","story":"  Lots of events are still to come, including tomorrow\u0027s fancy dress parade and the Rideout on Saturday.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.

The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8192520.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"musselburgh-bmx-club-needs-helpers-today","story":"  An appeal on the club\u0027s Facebook page said: \"We are looking for a small army of volunteers to help finishing off the BMX track this Sunday from 10am.  \"This is a race standard track that will serve the cycling community of the Lothians for years to come and it has plenty to offer all levels of cyclists.  \"The layout with the heavy machinery is all done and now the manual surfacing is ready to go.

Cycling minister Jesse Norman apologised after the message sparked a hail of angry responses from bike-users.  It came as Mr Norman announced plans for new road safety laws, including\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspoffences of causing death by dangerous or careless cycling, which would see cyclists who kill pedestrians treated in a similar way to drivers.  Mr Norman insisted that the changes were intended to protect \u0026ldquovulnerable road users, including cyclists.  But cycling campaigners said he was simply \u0026ldquotinkering around the edges of road safety.  The laws are being proposed by the Government after 44-year-old mother-of-two Kim Briggs was knocked over and killed by a bicycle courier in February 2016.  The message on the Conservative Twitter feed said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore launching a consultation into dangerous cycling so that our most vulnerable road users are protected.          I genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account. @Jesse_Norman https://t.co/m4QO8229Vn          \u0026mdash Chris Boardman (@Chris_Boardman) August 12, 2018  Boardman responded: \u0026ldquoThat says it all really. Wow, just wow. I\u0026nbsp genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account.  Urging other cyclists to complain to Mr Norman and his party, he added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not me that needs to know how you feel \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos me, with the dead mother, crushed to death by a car by the way. It makes me feel genuinely sick.  Carol Boardman died aged 75 when she was run over by a pick-up truck while on a bike ride near Connah\u0026rsquos Quay in north Wales.  BBC radio presenter Jeremy Vine also spoke out about the Tory message.  \u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom on a bike, I\u0026rsquom a vulnerable road user, said Vine.  \u0026ldquoIn 2016 there were 1,700 road deaths three were caused by cyclists.          Coupla things.1. When I\u0027m on a bike, I\u0027m a vulnerable road user.2.

On behalf of all involved, I would like to apologise.  Mr Boardman said Norman was \u0026ldquoone of the good guys, if only his party would empower him to do more.  In recent weeks the Department for Transport has announced a series of measures to protect vulnerable road users, including:  \u0026ndash Funding to give driving instructors training to ensure cyclists\u0026rsquo safety is prioritised.  \u0026ndash Better investigation of crashes.  \u0026ndash Investing \u0026pound100 million to improve dangerous roads.  The latest announcement includes the introduction of national guidance for cycling and walking infrastructure and updating parts of the Highway Code to combat close passing of bicycles.  Ms Briggs\u0026rsquo widower Matthew supports the proposed new laws.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences.  Ms Briggs was killed by Charlie Alliston, then 18, who was travelling at 18mph on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes.  He was sentenced to 18 months in jail after being found guilty of causing bodily harm by \u0026ldquowanton and furious driving.  The Victorian legislation, originally drafted to deal with reckless handling of horses, was used because there was no cycling equivalent to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving.  Department for Transport (DfT) figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain\u0026rsquos roads, but only three cases involved bicycles.  National charity Cycling UK claimed a \u0026ldquofull review of road traffic offences is required.  Cycling UK head of campaigns Duncan Dollimore described the current system of prosecuting and sentencing for careless or dangerous drivers as \u0026ldquosomething of a lottery which leaves victims and their relatives \u0026ldquofeeling massively let down.  He went on: \u0026ldquoAdding one or two new offences specific to cyclists would be merely tinkering around the edges.  \u0026ldquoIf the Government is serious about addressing behaviour that puts others at risk on our roads, they should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly, rather than attempt to patch up an area of legislation that\u0026rsquos simply not working.  Mr Norman said: \u0026ldquoAll these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8194552.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-2018-comes-to-a-close","story":"  Glasgow 2018 is the biggest sporting event the city has hosted since the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

Three senior union leaders have added their voices to calls from deputy leader Tom Watson for the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance text to be incorporated in its entirety into Labour\u0026rsquos new code of conduct on anti-Semitism.  Labour has launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party\u0026rsquos ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.  A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises its examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases.  \u0026ldquoThe NEC upheld the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism, but in recognition of the serious concerns expressed, agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views.

More than 90 projects will share around \u0026pound250,000 as part of GO LIVE!

The reclaimed wooden tables and mismatched sofas, give the place a cosy yet modern feel. It\u0026rsquos the purrfect place for city-dwellers and cats to unwind.  The first cat cafes originated in Taiwan in 1998 and similar cafes have been pawing their way across the globe. There\u0026rsquos definitely a good feline to this environment. I make myself comfortable and order a Portuguese tart, warm Nutella hot chocolate, and a curious little ragdoll kitten, named \u0026ldquoGroot \u0026ndash a character from the \u0026rsquos of the Galaxy movie nests in my lap.  There are 26 cats in total, some of which have been rescued and they have been named after popular cartoon, movie and TV characters based on their personality. There\u0026rsquos a Yoda, Merida from Brave and an Isa from Still Game. Like every pet, each cat has its own personality and quirks. Some sleep on the sofas beside guests, while others glance curiously from a distance. In exchange for attention or treats, the cats keep their visiting humans entertained and there\u0026rsquos a private area downstairs, where if the cats don\u0027t feel like socialising they can rest.  Tracey Malcolmson, 32, from Glasgow, has poured her heart and soul into the cat-pad. She created the hub to unite people over a hot drink, cake, and her obsession with cats.  \u0026ldquoHaving cats makes me feel less stressed, even when I\u0026rsquom in here and I feel stressed, they make me feel calm. There\u0026rsquos something special about them.  Malcolmson previously worked in NHS healthcare and thought that some kind of kit-tea therapy would be great for Glaswegians. As well as providing companionship for the lonely, pets have therapeutic qualities which can help people overcome stress or trauma.  Mikkel Munkholm, 26, Denmark said: \u0026ldquoCats are very calm and soothing creatures and they help me to relax.

The cafe serves hot drinks and food prepared in a cat-free environment.  The pet cafe trend started in Edinburgh with its cat cafe, Maison de Moggy, and the Edinburgh Chihuahua cafe. The popularity has seen similar pop-up events take place in Glasgow. Pie and Brew cafe, Bath Street, hosted a pop-up pug event where dog owners brought along their pet pugs to socialise and indulge in some \u0026lsquopuppachinos\u0026rsquo.  The purpose of the Purrple Cat Cafe is to rekindle a sense of community in the area and evoke feelings of visiting your gran\u0026rsquos house for tea. Malcolmson and staff have been finding ways to encourage customer involvement by hosting a range of equally quirky activities and events. Cat yoga and Thursday quiz nights have become the most popular activities.  Aspiring photographers regularly meet at the cafe for \u0026ldquoCamera Club to learn the top tips and tricks from professional photographers capturing the cats in their essence. The cats make perfect subjects for photo opportunities, as they cuddle up for a snooze, leap across their kitty obstacle course, and interact with customers.  Visitors are given some key ground rules before entering the cafe and the cats have also been trained to understand their boundaries. This ensures a chilled atmosphere for customers to relax and space for the cats to feel comfortable.  Another unique trait of this cafe is that it has been finding ways to involve younger children in events by hosting toddler-friendly sessions. Their recent toddler session took place between 17-20 July when under-fives were invited along to play with the cats and kittens.  Propped around the cafe are cat sculptures made by a talented member of staff known as \u0026lsquothe master Lego builder\u0026rsquo, and one ongoing project is a kitty Lego building session. The plan is to teach guests how to turn Lego blocks into impressive cat sculptures to showcase in their own home.  There\u0026rsquos always something interesting happening behind the walls of this idiosyncratic kitty haven. Customers have been encouraged to dress up in their best cat attire, and enter their photo into the cafe\u0026rsquos monthly competition. Winners receive will a \u0026ldquoCattire of the month prize and have their photo showcased inside.  For customers who find themselves regularly visiting The Purrple Cat Cafe, there are Platinum, Silver, and Gold memberships which can be applied for online. Members will receive: merchandise bags, discounts on food and drink, and have access to exclusive events. In the past, the cafe hosted a half birthday party, Valentine\u0026rsquos Day special and a cat-themed movie night available for members to attend.  The cafe regularly works with Cat Flap Charity which helps to re-home and rescue abandoned cats in Glasgow. Recently, the cafe has been raising funds for a cat rescue in Cyprus and is collecting donations. The next project the cafe is organising is a cat-themed Halloween event.  The Purrple Cat Cafe is open every day from 9:30am-9pm, sessions can be booked online in advance. The cafe welcomes everyone, except dogs.

Customers, he added, wanted just one thing \u0026ndash to get on the internet, simply and fast, and this was just the tool for them, able to be connected to the internet in a matter of moments.  Jobs had returned to Apple only the previous year after being ousted in 1985. Now he was enthusing about the sleek new computer\u0026rsquos translucent Bondi blue housing, which reflected Apple\u0026rsquos trademark design philosophy. It was very much the baby of Jobs and of his chief designer, Jony Ive.  \u0026ldquoThey look so good, you kinda wanna lick \u0027em, Jobs declared in a later interview, in front of a range of iMacs with different hues of translucent design.  So the \u0026lsquoi\u0026rsquo in iMac stood for Internet \u0026ndash but it also, according to a message that was flashed up on a screen behind Jobs, stood for \"individual\", \"instruct\", \"inform\" and \"inspire\".  The iMac was an astonishing success, to the point where it was said that a third of its sales were to people who had never previously bought a computer.  In the months and years ahead, the world would grow highly accustomed not just to that little \u0026lsquoi\u0026rsquo but also to a range of innovative \u0026ndash and highly desirable \u0026ndash new Apple consumer products: the iPod (launched in 2001), the iPhone (2007) and the iPad (2010). iTunes, its online music library, was launched not long after the first iPod.  Together, they made Apple\u0026rsquos fortune. They helped bring in an era of personal computers and transformed the way we communicate, listen to music and watch films in the digital age. Entire industries have been changed, too.  Jobs died in 2011, aged 56, of pancreatic cancer, and every obituary spoke of his creative genius and his determination to give his customers new experiences.  Apple\u0026rsquos record of innovation and popularity has continued apace. Recently it became the world\u0026rsquos first $1 trillion dollar public company. Last year alone it sold in excess of 216 million iPhones, with revenue of $141 billion \u0026ndash though these figures were down from 231 million and $155 billion in 2015.  The iPod, launched by Jobs in late 2001, wasn\u0026rsquot the first digital music player but it was a class apart: it was easy to use, it looked distinctive (that gleaming white housing, that circular scroll-wheel) and, in the earliest versions, it could hold up to 1,000 songs. So now you could listen to your favourite music while on the move, having downloaded it from a computer.  It wouldn\u0026rsquot be until 2004 that iPod sales really took off.  New, updated iPod models followed, becoming more sophisticated and capable of holding greater number of songs. In April 2007, the 100 millionth iPod was sold, making it the fastest-selling music player ever. Jobs said at that time the device had helped millions of people to rekindle their passion for music. The musician John Mayer said that \u0026ldquowithout the iPod, the digital music age would have been defined by files and folders instead of songs and albums. By 2010, the iPod had sold 250 million units.  In 2007 came the iPhone, which reinvented the phone. Not only could you make calls on it you could listen to music, browse the internet, write emails on a touch keyboard, take pictures with its two-megapixel camera. Jobs boasted that it was \u0026ldquoliterally five years ahead of any other mobile phone.  The iPhone, one noted tech writer said this month, \u0026ldquoarguably created the internet-connected, portable computing age we live in now.  There is no getting away from the huge impact of the iPhone. Time magazine wrote last summer that the phone had upended the personal-computer market, telecom companies, the movie and TV business, the gaming industry and the health industry \u0026ndash that last one, Time added, because the iPhone can be used to \u0026ldquomonitor various health metrics and access detailed health information, connecting with health professionals and even receiving health advice virtually anytime and anywhere.  The magazine went on: \u0026ldquoLooking back over the last 10 years, the hype before the launch of the iPhone if anything underestimated its impact on global industries and individuals. And with Apple on track to define and grow emerging technologies like augmented reality in mobile, Cupertino [Apple\u0026rsquos base] seems poised to make the iPhone even more important to our digital lifestyles, transforming industries in ways we have yet to imagine.  It has been estimated that 1.2 billion iPhones have been sold since 2007. Apple has launched many new models of the phone, and last November saw the iPhone X, which retailed at \u0026pound999 for 64GB of storage, and boasted an all-new 5.8-inch Super Retina screen and facial recognition.  It was, said one influential reviewer, \u0026ldquowithout a doubt the best iPhone Apple has ever made, and it represents a much-needed leap forward in design for the company. Despite its hefty price, it was the world\u0026rsquos bestselling smartphone in the first quarter of 2018.  Apple\u0026rsquos iPad, which saw the light of day in April 2010, was described by Jobs as a \u0026ldquotruly magical and revolutionary product. It was a slender tablet computer that allowed you to browse the web and check emails on a large screen while on the move. You could take photographs with it, listen to music on it. The iTunes store, with albums, films, TV shows and podcasts was built into the device. Apple had, once again, seemingly thought of everything.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos so much more intimate than a laptop and it\u0026rsquos so much more capable than a smartphone with this gorgeous, large display, said Jobs as he prepared to take the iPad through its paces.  Like the other devices, the iPad has been improved by the introduction of successive new models. More than 350 million units have been sold."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The SNP   s legendary party unity could be finally about to crack","story":"  It is unheard of for the First Minister to be openly criticised in this way and some of his followers were clearly shocked.

Had independence, she asked, been \u0026ldquokicked into the long grass by an FM keener on power at Holyrood than pursuing the goal she has worked for all her political life?.  She answered her question in the negative, but the column was a sustained criticism of the SNP\u0026rsquos safety-first policy on independence. \u0026ldquoIf the electorate senses the keenest advocates aren\u0026rsquot making a bold, confident case, she said, \u0026ldquoit hardly bolsters confidence among the waverers. The co-chair of the Independence convention compared independence to shooting the rapids on an inflatable raft: you just have to keep going forward because if you try to stop your vessel will capsize.  These are not isolated comments hyped up by the mainstream \u0026ldquoyoon media. I\u0027ve been hearing Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s leadership questioned by some quite senior figures recently. This is a good thing. Too much consensus leads to intellectual and political atrophy. The First Minister remains unassailable, and there is no challenge to her leadership. But she is going to have to find something inspirational to say, or we may see the SNP\u0026rsquos legendary party unity finally crack in October when she gives her renewed timetable for indyref2 \u0026ndash or rather doesn\u0027t. The First Minister\u0027s view, repeated last week after her meeting with Theresa May, is that there needs first to be clarity on the Brexit deal, and that\u0027s about as likely as Boris Johnson buying his wife a burqa.  This is causing immense frustration in a movement that, to paraphrase Harold Wilson, is a crusade or it is nothing. Many in the party don\u0027t understand why independence should wait upon the pleasure of a dithering and divided Tory government. What about the \u0026ldquotriple lock mandate: the Holyrood election victory, the parliamentary vote for a referendum and the majority in the 2017 Westminster elections? This mandate is a perishable commodity. And anyway, say commentators like the influential independence blogger James Kelly, the SNP has a \u0026ldquomoral duty to call an independence referendum to honour the commitment in last year\u0026rsquos manifesto.  Curran and Kelly argue that it is futile to wait until there is a sustained lead in the opinion polls for independence because that movement in public opinion will only come as a result of political leadership. When the last referendum campaign was launched by Alex Salmond, support for independence was stuck at 25%. Yet, by the weekend before the referendum ballot, some polls showed Yes neck and neck. Support for independence today is 45% and with a powerful campaign, they say, it could easily reach 60%. Why is she not out there already, leading from the front?  The First Minister has not deigned to appear at the recent independence marches, in Glasgow and Inverness \u0026ndash some of the biggest ever. She does seem happy to lead LGBT+ marches though \u0026ndash which is all very well, but her supporters would also like to see her out on the streets in The Cause. The SNP doesn\u0026rsquot endorse the All Under One Banner organisation, but if Sturgeon were to take over and lead these independence rallies, they would surely attract even greater numbers, like in Catalonia. What has she got to lose?  However, Sturgeon is not a populist, and dislikes angry demonstrations and political theatre, especially if it involves figures like the former SSP leader, Tommy Sheridan. She didn\u0027t intervene in the extradition of the Catalan nationalist, Clara Ponsati. She doesn\u0027t subscribe to Twitter storms, or support campaigns against bias in the BBC. She hasn\u0027t been giving much encouragement to disruption at Westminster over the Brexit \u0026ldquopower grab, though she has spoken strongly against it in Holyrood. The First Minister sometimes gives the impression of being more interested in policy than the passions of independence, and delivering on things like educational attainment targets \u0026ndash a thankless task.  However, Nicola Sturgeon has very good reasons to be cautious about insurgent politics, since she tried it only last year with disastrous results. For an SNP leader, there\u0027s nothing more humiliating than calling an independence referendum and then calling it off again, or \u0026ldquoresetting it. As a result of that miscalculation, the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the subsequent general election, including those of her Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, and the former leader, Alex Salmond. She\u0027s not going to make that mistake again, and wants to see support for Yes heading in the direction of 60% before she acts. She realises that another failed referendum would kill independence stone dead \u0026ndash as it did in Quebec.  So what is she going to say in this crucial conference speech in October? She can\u0027t just say that she\u0027ll come back next year, because politics will have moved on and Britain will be out of Europe. Well, one thing she could do is call for a different referendum: a People\u0027s Vote on Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon has been edging closer to endorsing a think twice referendum on Europe, but to the frustration of some of her closest advisers, she has not gone the distance. This could be the moment.  If the First Minister were to declare support for \u0026ldquoBrexyref2 she would at least be seizing the political initiative, and giving her party something concrete to do. There is an aching vacuum in politics right now because Labour has refused to support any repeat referendum, or even soft Brexit. There\u0027s already 60% Scottish support for remaining in the EU and this can only grow as the chaos deepens this autumn and winter.  Once the UK leaves the EU, Scotland will be out of Europe and Scots will lose their rights and privileges of EU citizenship. It also makes independence more problematic. The Irish border issue moves to the mainland, because if an independent Scotland tries to rejoin the European Union it would mean a hard border with England. This could make it that much harder to persuade middle Scotland that it is worth the trouble of leaving the UK \u0026ndash especially after witnessing the trouble caused by leaving the EU.  Nicola Sturgeon can legitimately argue there is no point in calling a referendum on Scottish independence now because the voters are simply not in any mood for one. Their minds are filled with images of stockpiling of food and medicines after a no-deal Brexit. But they could be mobilised to reverse or freeze Brexit. It wouldn\u0026rsquot satisfy the go-for-it tendency, but it would be better than sitting around doing nothing.

Following widespread outcry across the city and legal challenges put forward by those served with these notices it has suspended eviction plans \u0026ndash which put 330 refugees at risk \u0026ndash for 21 days.  However it is now claimed that four of six may have been entitled to support and accommodation all along. Refugee support charity Govan Community Project, which has been offering case work support to five of the six facing lock changes, claims that at least half of them should be eligible for support and have the right to remain in their flats.  The charity has already successfully appealed for asylum support for one person affected, and is in the process of applying for emergency asylum support \u0026ndash known as Section 4 \u0026ndash for three others, one of whom had already filed further submissions on his case, meaning his asylum appeal is ongoing.  It, along with charities including the British Red Cross, Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Survival Trust, now claim a significant proportion of the 330 at risk could also be eligible.  Their claims are backed by as yet unpublished monitoring data, shared with the Sunday Herald, which shows that almost 60 per cent of those denied Home Office support are actually entitled to it.  Owen Fenn, manager of Govan Community Project, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027ve seen five of the six people served lock change notices by Serco and we believe four of them are eligible for support. A lot of people don\u0027t know that they can access support. That\u0027s caused by a lack of face-to-face advice or any centralised hub where people can get information.  If the Home Office refuses a claim for refugee status, an asylum seeker is given 21 days notice that their support and accommodation will be discontinued. The Home Office says they should then leave the country but many claim they remain at risk of persecution, torture or death in their home countries.  Over the last year British Red Cross, Scottish Refugee Council and Govan Community Project monitored data on 147 cases of destitute refugees, who they believed to be eligible for support. Of those, 76 applications were successful, while a further 10 were awarded support after appeal.  The data also showed that an average wait of 37 days for a decision on granting asylum support at this stage, despite a Home Office target of five days.  Scottish Refugee Council believes the data is \u0026ldquohighly significant and fundamentally calls into the question eviction plans. It is now hosting free, weekly law clinics to re-look at the cases of all at risk of eviction.  Jillian McBride, refugee operations manager at the British Red Cross, said: \"In our experience, people who have come to the UK seeking protection struggle to access the support they are eligible for when they need it.  \u0026ldquoDelays in the process mean the Home Office regularly fail to meet their own timelines for making decisions, and refusals to provide support are often overturned on appeal. This has a serious humanitarian impact on people who are often already vulnerable. Those people denied support could face homelessness and nights on the streets, with no way of feeding themselves or their families.  Last week Serco Chief Executive Rupert Soames said he welcomed planned legal challenges to the six lock-change notices issued which he said would \u0026ldquoclarify an area of Scottish law which has so far been untested. He claims his organisation is in \u0026ldquoan impossible position and cannot continue to offer free accommodation to those without entitlement to it.

For some, the preparations for the convention seemed to be as exciting as the event itself. Men gabbed in the toilet stalls as they put on their outfits, while others stood over the sinks meticulously applying the make-up that would transform them for the day.  Clipboard-carrying organisers nervously whispered in ears and Red Dwarf actor Robert Llewellyn took to the main stage. Two of those dressed as the webbed superhero had even driven up from south of the border for the day, with one Spiderman saying: \"It\u0027s just about meeting others who are as mad as you are. Everyone is friendly and accepting, comic cons are just fantastic events.\"  The event, formerly known as Collectormania Glasgow, this year welcomed stars from both the big and small screen, with actors from Star Wars, Doctor Who and Game of Thrones among those drawing crowds of fans for a picture and autograph.  A collection of Bond girls featuring Octopussy\u0027s Janine Andrews, The Spy Who Love Me\u0027s Caroline Munro and Valerie Leon took their places on the venue\u0027s main stage at lunchtime before fans of Doctor Who and HBO\u0027s Game of Thrones were treated to some of the show\u0027s favourites.

Closing Saturday\u0027s festivities was a showing from World of Sport Wrestling performers Rampage Brown, Adam Maxted, Lionheart and So Cal Val while cosplayers were given crash courses in design and lines of fans waited with bated breath for a short picture opportunity with the actors and actresses behind the characters.  The two day event continues today, with a more limited programme of guests and a greater focus on visitor participation. Just two main stage events are scheduled, with a bigger emphasis on cosplay, giving the opportunity to learn from TV and film\u0027s best and brightest designers and offering fans the chance to get their photograph taken in the outfits which they no doubt spent hours, if not days, preparing.

So plentiful, in fact, that an average portion of chips alone (380g) will provide half of my daily calorie intake.  This was the finding of a new report by Obesity Action Scotland last week, in which researchers visited 30 Glasgow chippies and found portion sizes had increased by a whopping 80 per cent since 2002. The largest portion found (775g) provided three quarters of an adult\u0027s energy requirement.  The organisation is calling for regulation to control portion sizes, mandatory calorie labelling and half-sized portions to be offered.  The organisation is also fully aware that while chips \u0026ndash still the most commonly consumed take-away food in Scotland \u0026ndash make easy headlines, cutting down on deep fried potato is far from the only answer. As Scots now consume a quarter of our calories on food eaten out and about, it is also calling for definitive action to be taken to tackle the way the \u0026ldquoout of home food environment \u0026ndash everything from restaurants to petrol station shops and ice-cream vans \u0026ndash encourages us to overeat.  Because, says Lorraine Tulloch, programme lead for Obesity Action Scotland, it\u0027s getting serious. Two-thirds of the adult population in Scotland are overweight. Health experts predict that if nothing is done some 35 per cent of people in the UK will be clinically obese within 15 years, putting themselves at serious risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes.  This is nothing to do with blame and fat shame. \"It\u0027s increasingly difficult not to become overweight because we live in an environment where we are encouraged to overeat, says Tulloch. \"We know that portion sizes have grown over time and there\u0027s no calorie information on menus so we\u0027re all operating blind. We use unhealthy food very often because it is available and convenient. The important message is not \u0027don\u0027t eat chips\u0027. It\u0027s about understanding what that means when you do.  Leaving the wards of Glasgow Royal Infirmary at the end of a busy day Professor Mike Lean, consultant physician and chair of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University, firmly believes people need to know what obesity really means. So far today he\u0027s seen one patient who has gone blind, and two who have lost a leg \u0026ndash one of them has developed abscesses in the only remaining one \u0026ndash due to diabetes complications.  While the exact causes are still not fully understood, being obese is believed to account for 80-85 per cent of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, while recent research suggests that obese people are up to 80 times more likely to develop it than those with a normal body weight.  It\u0027s not just chips, Coca-Cola and Mar bars, he says, it\u0027s the whole push on take-away food, offered everywhere from petrol stations to vans outside schools.  He\u0027s also concerned, but not surprised, by the portion sizes. Food, he notes, has become cheaper than ever to produce, so why not make your bottle of Coke bigger, and encourage people to chose to buy more for the same price?  \"When we get bigger our appetite grows and our bodies send messages to our brains to ensure we don\u0027t get any smaller, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe are a very clever species. Other animals can get fat, but they can\u0027t get as fat as a human.  Food and drink retailing is worth almost \u0026pound30 billion annually across the UK. \u0026ldquoOur economy depends on people buying more and the government is determined that we need to push towards growth, adds Lean. \u0026ldquoThat\u0027s the free market. And the only way we can now deal with it is to regulate.\"  Regulation is not a popular position. In May this year, during a meeting with Jamie Oliver, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon agreed to curb junk food promotions like two-for-one pizza deals. There was an outcry with accusations of \"class snobbery\" and hypocrisy.  But Lean makes no apologies for his view. \"We\u0027ve got a tax on alcohol, smoking is banned in public places and that does have a positive effect. We are never going to ban chips entirely but maybe we need to ban vending machines selling chocolate \u0026ndashwe even have them in this hospital \u0026ndash and vans targetting children outside schools.\"  He shrugs off \"nanny state\" arguments. Is it nanny state when someone tells us we all need to drive on the left hand side of the road, or when we ban sulphurous fumes bellowing from chimneys, he asks?  As to the argument that the unhealthy choices are often cheap, he doesn\u0027t follow the logic. So, he points out, was asbestos insulation, but it was banned because it was hazardous to health. \"We now have 3.5 million people in the UK with Type 2 diabetes. Are we just going to brush them under the carpet? They are not just dying young they are suffering sometimes ghastly consequences.\"  Professor Franco Sassi, chair in International Health Policy and Economics at Imperial College London agrees the well-documented, super-size portion trend is simple economics. The costs, he claims, have been reduced by technology. \"It\u0027s had the same effect on food as it\u0027s had on all sorts of consumer goods.\"  Yet technology also has an effect on the make-up of food itself, with palm oil used because its cheap, despite the fact that healthier, and more environmentally friendly options would be better for all. Meanwhile sugar and salt are used to increase taste and make-up for lower quality ingredients.  \"The food industry should have been regulated long ago,\" he says. Instead the government\u0027s failure to act has seen a \"tidal wave\" of chronic diseases. It\u0027s costing society dear in many ways. An estimated four per cent of the UK health budget is spent dealing with the health fall-out of obesity.  Annie Anderson, professor of Public Health Nutrition at University of Dundee, claims portion size is only one element of a complex picture that is quite simply killing us. \"For me it comes down to a mantra about availability, price and marketing, she says.  \"The amount of money that chocolate companies put into marketing a single product is more than our total budget for health promotion for the whole year, she says. \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s become completely normal to graze all day and you\u0027re almost deviant if you don\u0027t. You have to be a very strong person to go against the dominant culture and some people don\u0027t have the time or capacity to do that.  Anderson claims most people become over-weight simply because they are not taking active steps to avoid it.  \"We have been working on this issue for decades and whatever has been done in the past, it is not enough, she says. \u0026ldquoThere has been an emphasis on education but that\u0027s only a single component \u0026ndash it won\u0026rsquot change behaviour on its own.  Local authorities have an important part to play, she argues. Research shows the more deprived an area, the more outlets selling fast food, alcohol, and tobacco are clustered in it.  Fiona Crawford, a consultant in public health for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, agrees that better urban planning is needed. Several years back she was part of a team involved in researching the out-of-school lunch choices of Glasgow secondary school pupils \u0026ndash including those in deprived areas \u0026ndash which unsurprisingly found chips, pizza and sausage rolls were among the most popular options.  One meal from a local shop contained 80g of fat, the maximum recommended daily intake for an adult man. Later they asked the 14/15 year olds what they could do? \"They came up with a range of very sensible suggestions from putting better shops into housing schemes to discouraging fast food outlets,\" she says.  The Scottish Government says it is committed to change, last month publishing a plan for a Healthier Future in Scotland with proposals for bans on junk food promotions. But many argue cultural change is also needed.  For Pete Ritchie, director of campaigning organisation Nourish, it\u0027s about creating a more holistically-informed set of policies that join up health and equality concerns with cultural and social ones. Along with the Scottish Food Coalition, Nourish is working towards a Good Food bill that will join up legislation on agriculture, planning, social security, and public health..  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s not wrong to be saying we need to control portion size, says Ritchie. \u0026ldquoThat\u0027s important. But we also need to work towards a better relationship with between us and our food. We need to work towards caring about ourselves enough to eat what we need. And then, he says, we need to find ways of putting what we need within easy reach.  Are you obese?  First find you Body Mass Index (BMI) by dividing your weight in kilos by you height in metres, then divide the answer by your height again:  \u0026bull 18.5 to 24.9 means you\u0027re a healthy weight  \u0026bull 25 to 29.9 means you\u0027re overweight  \u0026bull 30 to 39.9 means you\u0027re obese  \u0026bull 40 or above means you\u0027re severely obese  Generally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-apologises-to-lgbt-people-at-perth-pride","story":"  Rev Scott Burton opened the inaugural Perthshire Pride event in Perth on Saturday.

But the US developer, Todd Warnock, accuses environmentalists of making \u0026ldquogross generalisations that are \u0026ldquonaive and irrelevant. The golf course is an opportunity for \u0026ldquoecological enhancement, he insists.  Warnock, an investor from Chicago who lives in Dornoch, has teamed up with US golf billionaire, Mike Keiser, to propose a \u0026pound10 million championship golf course at Coul Links, near the village of Embo on the northeast coast.  But the area is protected from development under three different conservation laws because its unique sand dune network is home to rare and endangered plants, insects and birds.  The plan has been supported by some local people, but it has been opposed by seven major nature conservation groups in Scotland and the government\u0026rsquos wildlife agency, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Highland Council officials advised against it, but councillors ignored their advice and gave the golf course the go-ahead in June.  Since then environmental groups have been urging Scottish ministers to call in the planning application for reconsideration, so far backed by over 12,000 people. At the end of last month, ministers extended their deadline for deciding what to do until August 28.  The Sunday Herald revealed in February that rural economy minister Fergus Ewing\u0026rsquos most senior civil servant, Liz Ditchburn, had earlier intervened \u0026ldquoin a facilitative role on the Coul Links development. She visited the site in 2017 and convened a meeting at St Andrew\u0026rsquos House in Edinburgh for the developers to present their plans to officials.  Last month, the Coul Links developer described the \u0026ldquosymbiotic relationship between the golf course and the environment as \u0026ldquotrailblazing. This was \u0026ldquosomething that can be used as a template for future developments as well, it said in a tweet.  Conservation groups now fear that ministers may allow the golf course to go ahead and set a precedent for damaging other wildlife sites. The area is designated under the international Ramsar Convention, which they say gives weaker protection in Scotland than in England due to differing interpretations by Holyrood and Westminster.  \u0026ldquoThere are number of extremely worrying strands coming together around the case of Coul Links which suggest that the project could be being used as a stalking horse to systematically undermine and weaken Scotland\u0026rsquos hard won nature protection laws, said Aed\u0026aacuten Smith, head of planning with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoContrary to normal practice for such an application, the developer has obtained unprecedented access to the very highest levels of government. It is all the more worrying that the developer is now making unqualified claims of the project\u0026rsquos suitability to be used as a template for future projects on Scotland\u0026rsquos network of most highly protected nature sites.  Smith warned that developers could try to exploit any weakening of European Union laws to protect the environment as a result of Brexit. \u0026ldquoWhere vested interests are circling to take advantage of the loss of European oversight for nature protection, it is vital that ministers do not allow this to happen and intervene to save this important site from needless destruction, he said.  Members of the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have expressed \u0026ldquoshock and disappointment that Ramsar sites in Scotland seem to have less protection than south of the border. \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to think that if Coul Links was on the north east coast of England it would be safe from development, said the trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Jonny Hughes.  \u0026ldquoWe urge the Scottish Government to clarify the status of Scotland\u0026rsquos 51 Ramsar sites, listen to the 12,000 people who have asked them to call in the Coul Links application and halt this ruinous development on a triple protected nature site.  According to Dr Tom Dargie, an ecologist who chairs the local campaign group, Not Coul, the UK government position on Ramsar sites was unequivocal. \u0026ldquoIf Coul Links was in England the golf development simply could not be permitted because three basic requirements are missing, he said.  He added: \u0026ldquoCoul is now an important test case for Scotland upholding its obligations under this vital international environmental treaty. SNH demonstrated that the overall effect would be the loss of the environmental integrity of the site.  Campaigners have previously compared Coul Links to Donald Trump\u0026rsquos golf course at Menie on the Aberdeenshire coast. They said that ministers should learn the lessons from Menie, where another protected sand dune system was damaged.  Warnock, however, strongly objected to the comparison with Trump, of whom he is not a fan. He highlighted Dargie\u0026rsquos previous role as an ecological adviser to Trump at Menie - though Dargie\u0026rsquos advice on how to protect the dunes there was rejected by Trump.  \u0026ldquoNot Coul, led by Donald Trump\u0026rsquos former ecologist, RSPB and SWT continue to demonstrate that they lack specific knowledge of the Coul Links site, Warnock told the Sunday Herald.  \u0026ldquoTheir gross generalisations regarding development on designated sites are naive and irrelevant. We\u0026rsquove sought the advice and counsel of experts in the area of development in designated sites.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have worked tirelessly with Highland Council, SNH, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other statutory bodies. We are confident that we meet all necessary regulatory requirements.  Warnock noted that there were no objections on bird habitats, which formed much of the regulatory framework of the various wildlife designations. \u0026ldquoThe only objection to the project is from SNH regarding 13.4 hectares of affected sand dune habitat, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are confident Coul Links offers a tremendous opportunity for ecological enhancement, as well as profound economic opportunities for the highlands. We were pleased the Scottish Government extended its evaluation period because we are confident, like Highland Council\u0026rsquos planning committee, that a thorough assessment of the project will reveal it as a tremendous opportunity.  The Scottish Government promised to consider the protected status of Coul Links. \u0026ldquoMinisters had an initial 28 day period to consider the application for a golf course at Coul Links after Highland Council notified them it was minded to grant planning permission, said a government spokesperson.  \u0026ldquoIn order to fully consider the application ministers extended that period by a further 28 days from 1 August to consider whether or not to call in the application for their determination. The application site includes part of a Ramsar site, and ministers will consider all designations in reaching a decision on call in.  The extension will allow ministers \u0026ldquotime to give full and proper consideration to whether this planning application should be decided at the national level, the government argued."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-action-over-10-rise-in-number-of-rough-sleepers","story":"  The figures were revealed in an analysis by Scottish Labour \u0026ndash and the party has called on the Scottish Government to do more to help those sleeping on the streets, and to stop the situation getting worse.  Official figures show 2,682 people reported as having slept rough on at least one occasion in the three months before registering as homeless.  This is a slight increase of 22 people on last year\u0026rsquos figure, which was itself a nine per cent rise from 2015-16.  Previously, the number had steadily fallen, down from 5,845 in 2008-09 to 2,434 in 2015-16.  Scottish Labour believes the true figure of rough sleeping is likely to be higher, as not all of those on the streets will register with local authorities as homeless.  The party called for the First Minister to begin counting rough sleeping numbers and share information among Government agencies, local authorities and voluntary organisations.  Scottish Labour housing spokeswoman Pauline McNeill said: \u0026ldquoRough sleeping has become a visible sign of a society failing people. Many more people are vulnerable to homelessness due to the Tory and SNP austerity, and that must be prevented.  \u0026ldquoIt is unacceptable that anyone should be sleeping rough in 21st-century Scotland \u0026ndash yet these figures show that is actually on the rise.  The Glasgow MSP praised the work of the Government\u0026rsquos Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Action group but said it was \u0026ldquofarcical the Scottish Government had agreed to take forward many proposals \u0026ldquowithout acknowledging that our local authorities are starved of resources and need sufficient funding to be able to deliver them.  This is a feeling echoed by those suffering on the street. John is a Glasgow resident who was made homeless just last weekend, forcing him to sleep on the streets for the first time.  After contacting Glasgow City Council, the former resident of the Milton area of the city was given an appointment to register with the council, but will have to wait until at least Tuesday to meet a caseworker.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove only had to do this for a few days, and I have light at the end of the tunnel for me, he said. \u0026ldquoBut you never know, in the last week I\u0026rsquove met guys who have spent years sleeping rough. I don\u0026rsquot have a drug or alcohol dependency to pay for, I can just concentrate on having a bed for the night.  \u0026ldquoThere are lots of people in the same position as me, new to this and never having dealt with homelessness before.  The Scottish Government has said that \u0026ldquotackling and preventing homelessness is a key priority."},{"url":null,"title":"the-big-read-what-went-wrong-with-democracy","story":"  Democracy is a simple idea \u0026ndash that people can govern themselves. How that is achieved is unfortunately not so simple. Because democracy and elections are so closely linked they have at times become interchangeable words and interchangeable ideas. There is reason to caution against that, we have more elections and referendums than ever but on very many indicators of democracy things are going backwards. To such an extent that the US is now reclassified from a full democracy to a flawed democracy by organisations that measure such things.  While a majority of people voted for Brexit across the UK (we all know that Scotland voted to remain yet seems we are still leaving) there is a big Union Jack-coloured question mark over whether it was a legitimate majority at a UK level. The leave campaign broke the laws on referendums by spending around \u0026pound600k more on the campaign than they were allowed to.  Most of that money was spent on highly targeted facebook ads some considered to be extremely misleading. These ads where what is called \"micro targeted\". If Facebook algorithms knew you cared strongly about polar bears (which they do because their whole business model is about getting to know you, probably better than you know yourself) then ads telling you about how the EU stops us from protecting polar bears would be shown on your timeline. Some of these messages were so finely tailored to particular interests, personality types or psychological traits that they were shown to only a few hundred people.  Who pays for such ads and in whose interest they shape our view of the world is murky and confusing. Was it just very rich, interested businessmen? Was it the Russians? Was it the CIA? No one really knows.  In the US, Donald Trump seems to be trying to turn the clock back on hard won rights of minorities and woman and upending ideas of fairness and justice. Any criticism of him is \"fake news\" while he seems to be able to claim that the US air force now flies invisible planes. In a subversion of the Emperor\u0027s new clothes apparently only smart people cannot see them.  This should draw our attention to the problem of only thinking of democracy as elections. To do so does not say enough about the role of information and how humans choose one thing over another. This interplay between people, data and technology is a key question of our time and holds big threats to our democracy. Or enough about the shape and values of the institutions of the state and government. Is power awarded every few years at elections then handed down on high from an exalted centre, be it Holyrood or Westminster ?  It is now reasonable to worry that human beings via their connection into worldwide networks such as Facebook can themselves be \"hacked\". Maybe we are making decisions against our own interests but in the benefit of those rich or powerful enough to buy or collect enough data to know us better than we know ourselves. It could be an easy move to get away with, no one likes to think they are being tricked into making bad decisions for themselves. This could mean that informed choice in elections or referendums becomes a questionable idea.  All of this might suggest something good going bad but it is much more than that. It is more like an awakening to a fuller reality of our politics, which has been better but was never that good. Taking the red pill in the matrix. This awakening could be seen to happen in several stages although in reality it is much messier than that.  The underlying issues with our democracy are about institutions and process that were built in a different age being far too slow to change to keep up with a time that is so remarkably different from what has gone before. When we designed parliaments and council and civil services in the last century or often long before, they were inevitably designed from the top down. That might have worked when it fitted the shape of our society. But, in a horizontal, peer-to-peer, networked world is it any wonder our governments and councils find it increasingly difficult to govern?  Scotland\u0026rsquos own political institutions are youthful when compared with those at Westminster but they were largely inspired by them. That fact that a majority of Scots in a recent BBC survey thought their best days were ahead as a nation while in England most people feel they are in the past, is a good outcome of that partial modernisation that came from devolution.  Westminster political culture and its institutions are stuck in a time of black bakelite phones when the world is driven by smartphones. This means large parts of England are held behind by a centralised state and economy, by an electoral system that gives them little representation and by a culture that is best symbolised by a second chamber made up of Lords, Barons and Baronesses, most appointed by the Prime minister and some inheriting the role from their ancestors. Blocked from moving forward, stuck in nowhere land, is it any wonder that some hark back to that mythical time of Churchill and empire?  For many Scots the solution is independence and you can understand why. Yet, we are always going to be part of the same island and closely connected as people as well as adversely affected by Westminster, that crazy uncle in an old building slowly sinking into decrepitude. While we are represented there by Scottish parties they have a duty to try to make things better.  It is not only our institutions of government that are outdated. A centralised media, reporting things from only a narrow range of perspectives and seeing balance as putting a case for and against even within a once accepted status quo, is being left behind. As other sources of news and information grew online and became shareable peer to peer, traditional narrow versions of the truth became challengeable. This seemed to make obvious to many more people that certain versions of events served one set of interests over another. A good example of this was that the BBC was ousted from its position as an overwhelmingly trusted source of information in Scotland, when it was felt it viewed the world through the establishment eyes of the United Kingdom and at times against the interests of those who wanted an independent Scotland. The same happened in England and Wales with those who supported Brexit.  More recent events are adding to lots of personal internal acknowledgements that, because voters can be targeted and manipulated with such scientific accuracy and high impact via Facebook, this was what was going on all along in a more clumsy and scattergun approach through more traditional media.  The upshot of this is that people are unsure what to believe anymore. To have to admit that you can no longer be certain about both the content and the motives of those once trusted sources is deeply unsettling to the point of frightening. You might wish to double down on the certainty of the past and hark back to that time when things seemed more stable. You might look to new sources of authority with simple straightforward answers, certain of their views and aligned with base human instincts of protecting the insiders and blaming the outsiders. We see these effects here in Scotland as well as elsewhere.  Fake news is not new. Powerful people have always sought to control the shared stories of a society. That is the very source of power. Shape and control information and more importantly what the information means and you can affect a population\u0026rsquos values, what is important to them and so ultimately who they follow as leaders. The great religions knew this, as did the great politicians and the not-so-great media moguls. To try to understand what is different now requires a full admission that the effect of digital technologies on ourselves and our society are very deep and very powerful. Despite things being radically different now we tend to hang on to the things that are similar, it is how we stay comfortable. It means that when we check in with our memory of the past we are unable to acknowledge the full scale of the change. If we continue to try to treat the present like the past then the upheavals and ruptures that come with these changes will be amplified and magnified to be more dangerous and frightening than they need to be.  Democracy and good governance should be the way to dampen and manage the future shocks of the technological revolution, the upheaval of climate change and the dangers of growing geopolitical tensions. One of the many things that took root during fertile period in the lead up to independence referendum was the Electoral Reform Society\u0026rsquos \"Democracy Max\" project, an investigation into what would make a good Scottish democracy.  It was an 18-month process of a representative \"peoples gathering\" in deliberative forums, public meetings and expert round-tables, all arriving at a detailed report recommending everything from media regulation to a citizens\u0027 second chamber.  Six years on, we are still pushing forward on the main insight from that process and the subsequent campaigns and actions. That idea that structures of democracy will always be limited if they are built from the top down. The actual method by which the institutions are designed and made will always result in forms of elite rule if they are elite driven.  Political intention, ideology, the personality and party of our representatives all matter, but there is something inbuilt now in the way that our democracy has evolved that has made it operate much more in the interests of some than of others. The reactions to this have been a mix of positive in a rise in political activism and worrying in that populists have sought to exploit those who feel left behind.  It is vital that some of these symptoms are addressed by better regulation, policing and enforcement of the mechanics of elections, parties and campaigns, and by radical reform of our institution so they can catch up with our society. A large conclusion of all of our work in Scotland is that making politics local and deliberative \u0026ndash i.e. allowing space and time to think and talk with other members of your community about problems and solutions \u0026ndash is an important way to inoculate our society against anti-democratic forces that are on manoeuvres as existing institutions flounder.  A more deliberative politics is a way to grow and develop more of us into informed, critical and active citizens. Some powerful people might not like this and might say people just want us to make decisions on their behalf \u0026ndash this is infantilising and insulting to people because there are many examples of Scots across the country collectively doing things for themselves too often hindered by the authorities and institutions when they need to be helped to flourish.  These activities have been the inspiration for the most recent phase of a campaign for democracy to be built from the ground up, \"Act as if you own the place\". The Our Democracy coalition has been experimenting with and learning from deliberative forums in small communities across Scotland asking them to plan their futures then vote on budgets for community projects to help make the plans happen.  This has shown that these sorts of new institutions and processes can be created within the shell of the old. People are already trying to do it. It\u0026rsquos not a case of the state getting out the way but of reshaping to support the growth of this work.  This is why we are cautiously optimistic that parts of the Scottish Government and Scottish councils are responding to these pressures for change with the Democracy Matters consultation which will feed into a bill on Scottish local governance \u0026ndash a bill we hope will help our local institutions of governance transform themselves into \"the new within the shell of the old\".  The consultation itself is being done in a new way, they are trying hard to really involve people. That means if you want to say something the door is more open than it has ever been in the past. As always there will be resistance to any calls for those with power to give up any of it, that is why it is vital that pressure is felt from the communities to be allowed to exercise their own power.  The Our Democracy coalition has created a Declaration on Local Democracy. We wanted to summarise the principles for transformation that we think have become obvious after six years of countless discussions and deliberations with communities across Scotland. Please take take time to read that declaration and make a response to the Democracy Matters consultation. The history of state and institution building makes one thing very clear \u0026ndash if it\u0027s not built by us then it won\u0027t be for us.  Willie Sullivan is the director of the Electoral Reform Society Scotland  THE DECLARATION ON LOCAL DEMOCRACY IN FULL:  \u0026ldquoDemocracy is the right for people to decide how the place where they live is run. For a hundred years this right has built our communities, our society and our sense of justice. But too few people now believe that this right is being honoured, too few believe that they decide and too many believe they are powerless and voiceless. So we call for a new democracy which is ready to help us build for a hundred years to come.  \u0026ldquoFirst, decisions must be made for each place, in that place by the people who live there. Our towns and villages must decide for themselves just as our nation must decide for itself. Power must exist at the scale of the community which is affected. We need our democracy much closer.  \u0026ldquoSecond, the right to decide should not disappear each time the brief flicker of an election is over. Delegating our right to decide is not, in itself, enough. We must create a democracy that involves us all the time, where citizens do not just choose rulers but shape the rules.  \u0026ldquoThird, democracy must be powerful. The right to choose must be matched by the power to do \u0026ndash and the power to do must be matched with the resource to do it. Democracy is not gifted from above but from below, so power and resource must rest in the places where people live.  \u0026ldquoThis is our simple vision for our future a truly local democracy, a truly participatory democracy and a truly powerful democracy.  \u0026ldquoWe have learned the lesson of our last hundred years it is not enough that the future is built, it must be built for us. We must now learn a lesson for our next hundred years it is not enough that the future is built for us, it must be built by us."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-100-seats-have-switched-from-leave-to-remain-since-eu-referendum","story":"  The findings suggested that most seats in England, Scotland and Wales now contain a majority of voters who want to stay in the EU.

The analysis, obtained by The Observer, suggested the development was driven by growing doubts about the case for Brexit among Labour voters in the north of England and Wales.  The findings will increase pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to reconsider Labour\u0026rsquos refusal to give its backing to a second referendum on EU membership  Even though polls regularly report a strong lead for Remain among Labour voters, a majority of the party\u0026rsquos constituencies backed Brexit in 2016, leaving party strategists wary of any suggestion that it might not deliver withdrawal.

Only 30% believe decisions should be taken by organisations overseen by both the Scottish and UK governments, as happens now.  At present, Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure, is funded by Transport Scotland but is ultimately accountable to Westminster rather than Holyrood.  The Scottish Government has been pressing for its full devolution, arguing the move would help to improve performance on the railways.  Public views on the issue were explored as part of a report written by former UK transport minister and now independent transport consultant Tom Harris, using new polling research by consultant Mark Diffley.  The report was commissioned by Abellio but Mr Harris said it was researched, written and managed independently.  Survey data was gathered from 1,063 people in May, using the ScotPulse panel.  Alongside support for decisions to be taken in Scotland, the survey found that less than 20% of people \"know a lot\" about either Network Rail or train operator Abellio ScotRail.  Meanwhile, there was also confusion about who owns and runs different aspects of the railways.  Mr Harris said: \"The public and political debate about the future of Scotland\u0027s railways has suffered from confusion about who is responsible for what.  \"This tends to lead to politicised solutions to any perceived problems which, more often than not, are informed by ideology rather than reality.  \"This research, however, makes it clear that the public is focused on operations rather than politics.  \"Public support for the operational devolution of Network Rail is clear, with less than one-third favouring the status quo and six in ten favouring a clear structure under the control of the Scottish Government.  \"This is not a political or constitutional issue. It is simply about how to best-run our railways.\"  The full report is due to be published on August 20."},{"url":null,"title":"proposals-to-boost-teaching-profession-unveiled-by-lib-dems","story":"  The proposals to be discussed in Dunfermline, Fife, on September 8 include a call for a new premium to attract teachers to schools in disadvantaged areas and retention bonuses for those who commit to posts in hard-to-fill areas.

It will eventually get within 3.8 million miles of the surface in the years ahead, staying comfortably cool despite the extreme heat and radiation, and allowing scientists to vicariously explore the sun in a way never before possible.  \u0026ldquoAll I can say is, \u0026lsquoWow, here we go\u0026rsquo. We\u0026rsquore in for some learning over the next several years, said Eugene Parker, the 91-year-old astrophysicist after whom the spacecraft is named.  Protected by a revolutionary new carbon heat shield and other high-tech wonders, the spacecraft will fly past Venus in October. That will set up the first solar encounter in November.  Altogether, the Parker probe will make 24 close approaches to the sun on the seven-year mission.  For the second straight day, thousands of spectators jammed the launch site in the middle of the night as well as surrounding towns, including Mr Parker and his family.  He proposed the existence of solar wind \u0026mdash a steady, supersonic stream of particles blasting off the sun \u0026mdash 60 years ago.

However that could pose a security and safety problem for the organisers, DF Concerts, as there are still four concerts due to take place by August 19.  Once the barrier comes down, there would only be a modest railing between Princes Street and the bandstand, and there could be crowd issues with people seeking a free view.

In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 12, 2018 at 11:00 am3.56 acres at Vinbreck, Sandwick Offers over £160,000 Substantial, derelict house and various ruinous outbuildings in prime, elevated location with outstanding, unrestricted views over Stenness Loch and open farmland.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this.

People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Sunday 12 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brave, the title of her memoir and manifesto is a call to arms for us all to wake up to the misogyny of the entertainment industry and beyond, her bid to give voice to the victims of sexism and violence and to join her Rose Army of free thinkers striving to make things better and reclaim their lives.

But if you continually cover the sore and pretend it’s not there, it will eat away at you. Bravery isn’t just you being brave out in the world, it’s also with yourself.” In Brave, McGowan says the alleged attack by Weinstein happened in his hotel suite at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when she was invited there after a screening of her film Going All the Way. McGowan says he later contacted her but she rebuffed his advances and after accepting a payment of $100,000, which she says she took as an acknowledgment of what had taken place, she says she was blacklisted by Weinstein and her career sidelined.            She doesn’t name him in her book, she’s taken back control and won’t have “The Monster’s” name in it – today she calls him “that warthog from hell”. Of his refusal to acknowledge what she says happened, she says simply, “Of course. Which just makes you feel terrible. Every time his lawyers say ‘consensual’ it gives me a body flashback and makes me sick to my stomach, consensual my ass. Like I would ever let that warthog from hell touch me. I wish he would cease to exist. I just wish he was not on the planet anymore, just cease.”McGowan had always spoken about the alleged attack privately, but her battle against Hollywood became public when she discovered the power of Twitter in 2015. After receiving a casting note for an audition for an Adam Sandler film that suggested she wear a form fitting top, push up bra and show some cleavage, she rolled her eyes, posted it on Twitter and went to bed. In the morning she woke up to an internet storm of support, calling out Hollywood’s sexism.Did she think ‘oh brilliant’, or ‘oh no, what have I done?’She laughs, “Kind of both. At first I thought ‘oh no’, then I thought actually that’s brilliant, then I thought ‘oh no’ again. It’s very strange when things go viral and you’re in people’s heads, on their phones, it’s powerful and weird and nice being on the other side of it.”            Silenced in the world of Hollywood, the internet was an arena in which McGowan found her voice. “There was no way to speak out if someone was controlling the media and dominating it. But they can’t control the internet, you have your freedom and your access route.”So when Fox promoted the new X-Men film with an image of Jennifer Lawrence being strangled, she published online an open letter of objection, part of a backlash against the promotion that saw it withdrawn. Writing in her book she says, “I felt an obligation to be a voice for women, people who had suffered from violence.”• READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book Festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpBut why does McGowan think it’s on her to object, why does she have this strong sense of obligation?             “It sometimes feels like if I don’t, who else is going to? If not me, then who, and why not me? I have a special tool set. I’ve dealt with some of the big baddies and I’ve had a lot of hardship and I’ve battled through them and I’ve survived. And I know you can help others get to the other side. “I’ve always had a thing for justice, I don’t know what it is, I just don’t like seeing misjustice and I certainly don’t like predators.” McGowan spears Hollywood’s misogyny in Brave, pointing out that in 2016 only 23 per cent of speaking roles on screen were female, the majority in horror films. “And we know how they get treated,” she writes. Further, The Directors Guild of America is 96 per cent male, and has been since 1946, which McGowan argues means that for your entire life you have been fed a steady diet of largely male thought and bias about women. “Why is 96 per cent of our information, entertainment and philosophy coming from men?... Film and television is a white male’s playground and through their narrow vision comes the manipulated mirror you’re largely forced to see yourself in. If that’s not malewashing I don’t know what is.”With an online following calling out sexism, when people started talking about harassment by Trump in 2016, McGowan didn’t hesitate to join #whywomendontreport (their sexual assault) debate.  “Trump helped elucidate what sexism and racism are, filled it out in big burning block letters and people went ‘oh, that’s what this is’. Thanks Trump!” She laughs.McGowan says she is speaking up for people like her, the disenfranchised, the hurt, the lost, the lonely, the brave ones who choose to live their lives differently, see things differently and function in a society that doesn’t want them in their own way. “The Rose Army is an army of thought,” she says. “We stand for freedom of spirit and mind. We stand for dissent. We stand for equality and the right to have our lives be unencumbered by proscribed thoughts and traditional mores.” McGowan’s book festival appearance is tied to the theme of identity, and the idea of whether we choose our own identity or have one forced upon us.“I grew up in a really unusual way that led me to have my own identity and not be co-opted,” she says, “and then later as an actor I played multiple identities so identity has always been a really interesting idea for me.”Now 44, it was growing up among the Children of God in rural Tuscany in the Seventies that McGowan first learnt to retreat into her own head, rejecting the rules of the cult. Then later after the family escaped and returned to America, she was bounced among relatives, but found solace in reading, identifying with the persona of each book’s protagonist, a harbinger of her later career. “I used my training from books, absolutely, it’s the only acting training I’ve ever had,” she says. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: 18 must-see shows picked by The Scotsman’s criticsIf McGowan’s childhood reads as traumatic, she also manages to convey the pleasure she and the pack of cult children took in their Tuscan playground, the rows of marching cypresses and olive groves, despite often being hungry, confused and scared. And it was growing up in a cult that made her alert to the mechanics of control when she arrived in the US, then later in Hollywood.“When I came out of the Children of God everybody was saying how weird it was, how I lived and grew up, and I just thought ‘well, it’s weird how you live, you’re living under the same kind of dictates, you’re just not aware of it’. Everything was the same except bigger and more diluted. I thought ‘if you think you’re free, you’re not’. I was really shocked to find how the same belief systems being utilised, but a more internalised version.”After leaving home at 15, she headed to LA where she was discovered standing on a street corner and offered a part on a film, Paul Shore’s 1992 comedy Encino Man. To the hungry and homeless McGowan, it was a means of survival. “I was a journeyman actor, it was not my love, it was just something I happened to be good at.”Success followed with The Doom Generation and she made her breakthrough in horror flick Scream, then headlined in Going All the Way, Devil in the Flesh and Jawbreaker, yet by the end of the 1990s, according to McGowan because she was being sidelined, the big film roles had dried up. Switching to TV she was a lead in supernatural series Charmed from 2001-6, then in a return to film starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s double-feature film Grindhouse in 2007. Parts in Fifty Dead Men Walking, Conan and other films followed then in 2014 she realised an ambition and made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed short film Dawn, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.Since Dawn McGowan’s time has been taken up with Brave and the creation of a multimedia album, Planet 9, released in January at the same time as the book.“I’m really excited about performing it at my first music festival in Norway in November,” she says. “Planet 9 is kind of the other side of the book, where you go once your brain has been changed. It’s a place I invented, then astronomers found a Planet 9 four years ago – I almost fell off my chair! So I started writing songs for this place, and music. It’s my sanity. My art projects are what has kept me sane, that and my therapy.”McGowan is also writing a second book, on the subject of trust, a behind the scenes story of her life as she set about telling her story, a time in which she says ex-Mossad agents hired by Weinstein to quash misconduct allegations, followed her. “What is trust, how do we do it? I had to learn how to trust, otherwise you’re never going to trust anybody again in your entire life.”Given her experiences, how many people does she trust in her life now?“I trust about seven people,” she says, “and then the rest of the world, I hope,” she laughs.Seven’s quite a lot, I tell her.“Yeah, I’m doing pretty good,” she laughs and reconsiders. “Maybe it’s about three or four.”Fighting the Hollywood machine would deplete your faith in human nature, not to mention your resources. Ask McGowan where she lives now, and she comes straight back with “Nowhere.“I don’t have a house. I sold it to pay legal bills, so now I just travel. I live in hotels, airbnbs, on friends’ couches. Fighting the machine is not cheap, and they’re trying to bankrupt me.” • READ MORE: Edinburgh book festival chief hits out at visa issues facing international writersAnother front in McGowan’s fight against misogyny comes in the shape of the face cream she has developed with her aunt. It sounds unlikely at first, why is she dabbling in face cream? Yet as she talks you see her logic. “I want to disrupt the beauty industry,” she says. This is the woman who back in 2015 cut off her “long, glossy Kardashian-esque hair. I thought I looked more like a blow-up sex doll… I had been turned into the ultimate fantasy f*** toy by the Hollywood machine. I was dying on the inside and embarrassed by what I looked like on the outside.” And shorn of her hair, the real McGowan came out fighting. “And everyone complains about unrealistic beauty standards, but nobody really looks at it from a class point of view. I think it’s deeply classist, that if you don’t want chemicals you have to pay $150. It’s all part of the bigger scheme, of the way they keep women down. You pay them less and charge them more.“I’ve found an amazing laboratory that’s not connected to the expensive companies, to make an amazing product, that’s natural, and unisex.”And because this is McGowan we’re talking about, it’s not just dewy skin she’s after, there’s a bigger goal. “Ten per cent of the income is going to a centre which will provide long-term care for victims of violence, and I want some day to start a spa staffed by domestic violence and human trafficking victims. When people’s finances and self-esteem have been torn apart, they have no idea how to operate in the world but we can set them up so they can train others. So it becomes kind of like a school, that’s the company I’m building,” she says.“I hope to keep changing the world and do good for others. And make great art.” And when she sees the lengths people have gone to to try and shut her up…...“they’re still going,” she says.But she’s still going too...“Yep.”...does she ever feel overwhelmed? “Sometimes I get overwhelmed... a little. But the only way to change things is to lift the blanket and shine a light on the darkness. My goal is to expose Hollywood for what it really is. I have a million more stories I could tell in this book, but I don’t have the energy to document all of the dickery.” She laughs, exasperated, but determined. “In the book I say I’m like a phoenix and with this book, I rose again.”• Rose McGowan with Afua Hirsch is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Monday, Baillie Gifford Main Theatre, 3:15pm, £12, (£10).

Perhaps, as Mark Zuckerberg is said to have suspected, that was his plan all along.             His removal, last week, from several major platforms, including Apple, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook, may have reduced his channels of communication, but it has also raised his profile, boosted downloads of his InfoWars app and handed him a new grievance to nurse and, of course, he still has his website.            This is the Catch 22 of the post-truth era. Give the priest of paranoia a platform for his conspiracy theories and watch them thrive. Deny him a platform and help create a new one. Alex Jones: the man they tried to silence the prophet who saw “the truth” so clearly the establishment closed ranks against him. Whether he is banned or not, Jones’s alternative reality will endure. In the relentless pursuit of clicks, the MSM and social media have turned crackpots like Jones into credible figures, legitimising their hate-speech and allowing them to blur the distinction between fact and fiction. It’s a bit late now to start worrying that their rhetoric is beyond the pale.Look at the damage that has already been done the racist invective that has been normalised the way the parameters of what is and is not acceptable have changed since the BBC first broke new ground by inviting BNP leader Nick Griffin on to Question Time in 2009.Nigel Farage, a politician who has made so many appearances on that programme his name has surely been engraved on the back of his seat, now has his own LBC show on to which he recently invited former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who in turn called for English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson to be released from jail. The BBC, not content with having effectively created Farage, invited former editor-in-chief of Breitbart, Raheem Kassam, on the Today programme to big up Robinson and, in the Spectator, Rod Liddle reacted to Boris Johnson’s comments on the burqa by yearning for a bit more Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.             Whenever it is mooted that giving airtime to this coterie of right-wing extremists might be inadvisable, libertarians insist the best way to counter bad arguments is with good arguments. Even in the face of Brexit and Trump, they’re still saying it. That’s how Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey justified not banning Jones. Fight lies with facts, he said. But it’s not like no-one’s tried to tackle the problem head-on. And how has it worked out? Well, last week the BBC referred to a violent attack on a left-wing bookshop as a “protest”, if that’s an indication. Beyond the pursuit of clicks, there are two main drivers of the rise of the alt-right. One is a wilful misunderstanding of the concept of freedom of speech the other is problem of “false balance”. The latter is rife amongst broadcasters. The producers of a news programme decide to cover, say, the poor rape conviction rates. They invite on a representative from Rape Crisis, but feel the need to “balance” that representative with someone who believes many women are “asking for it”, then treat the two views as if they are morally equivalent. This practice inflates the importance of fringe figures, such as men’s rights activist Mike Buchanan.With the democratisation of the media has come a conflation of the freedom to speak and the right to be heard, so that nowadays every time an article is axed or a contributor dropped, there are cries of “censorship”. In reality, all platforms – be they print, broadcasting or social media – make decisions on which pieces will run and which will hit the spike. I know, for example, that the kinds of columns I write would never find a home in the Daily Mail, but there is no more onus on the Daily Mail to publish what I write than there is on me to read what it publishes.Jones may be legally entitled to express his opinions on a US street corner and on his own website but no privately owned company is obliged to disseminate them. Yet the belief that removing his videos and podcast would infringe on his freedoms is so entrenched that, for years, his “right” to spread lies about the Sandy Hook massacre has been allowed to trump the rights of bereaved parents to mourn the deaths of their children free from calumny and harassment.             Some people argue that social media platforms have more in common with Times Square than the New York Times that they are virtual street corners rather than virtual publishers. But this too is specious. Most social media companies curate content to a greater or lesser degree. And there are rules users are supposed to adhere to, even if they appear incoherent and are inconsistently applied. Up until now, there has been a perception that Facebook is happy to crack down on those with small follower bases while turning a blind eye to those, like Jones, who can be relied upon to drive traffic.The fact that Apple, Facebook and YouTube have now taken a stand against Jones shows social media companies are finally acknowledging that with great power comes responsibility. If their ban on Jones has come too late to destroy InfoWars, then at least the precedent it sets may prevent aspiring Joneses from building similar empires in the future.Over at Twitter, which sees itself as “the free speech wing of the free speech party”, Dorsey is still in denial. He said Jones hadn’t violated Twitter’s rules (changing his mind last night after CNN presented him with evidence). Twitter’s rules forbid hateful conduct, harassment, violent threats, wishes of physical harm on individuals. But they are, in any case, manmade. If they don’t preclude comparing Parklands shooting survivor David Hogg to a Nazi, then change them. It’s not difficult.Now social media sites are finally thinking about the ethics of validating the alt-right, it is to be hoped the traditional media will follow suit. It would be good if the Spectator stopped seeking out fame-hungry egotists to write pieces on the evils of feminism and our newspapers and public service broadcaster asked themselves where their predilection for giving succour to every two-bit racist with an eye for the main chance is likely to lead. Such commentators do not express themselves in a vacuum their words are heard, absorbed, promulgated and sometimes acted upon. Every day, we bear witness to the physical legacy of alt-right ideology hateful slogans daubed on walls, for example, and a spike in the number of attacks on Muslims.            With so much at stake, those who have licensed sinister fools like Jones, Farage or Bannon must stop shrugging their shoulders and mumbling “freedom of speech” like a spell to ward off criticism. It might be too late to put the genie back in the bottle, but there’s no longer any excuse for giving it a prime-time slot."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782643.1534020401!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm at the mercy of ideologues who won t face facts","story":"        The march of progress has been stopped in its tracks by political dogma and prejudice, writes Euan McColm.                 The economist John Maynard Keynes is often quoted as responding to a challenge over a shifted position by saying, “When the facts change, I change my mind.” There is some debate over whether Keynes ever actually uttered those words – or a variation of them – but regardless of their provenance, they contain a simple wisdom.            No matter how strongly we might hold a belief, when presented with evidence that it is wrong, we must be prepared to change our minds. Otherwise, how can we progress? Scientific discovery would cease, self-examination would become redundant, conmen would have countless barrels of fish to pop off.            In this, the new age of the ideologue, open minds seem more scarce than ever. Across the political spectrum, dogmatism is the in-thing to give ground, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that one is wrong, is unthinkable.The Labour Party is controlled entirely by ideologues. Leader Jeremy Corbyn and those closest to him, whether elected members, special advisers, or party officials, have remained true to beliefs cemented in their teens.Their belief in the efficacy of far-left politics is absolute. Some of those closest to the Leader of the Opposition are communists. As ideologies go, communism is one of the strictest, don’t you think?The Labour Party’s anti-Semitism crisis is an inevitable result of the leader’s ideology. If your lifelong position has been that the “imperialist West” is a force for bad, there is a danger that among your fellow travellers will be some who hold extreme views. Such entanglements have brought Corbyn to where he now stands, leader of a Labour Party that has lost the trust of most of British Jewry.             So rigid is Corbyn’s belief system that he has always been blind to the flaws of those he considers allies. In many instances he has embraced anti-Semites, prizing their opposition to the West over anything else.Prime Minister Theresa May is not, I think, a rigid ideologue. The Conservative Party, however, is being run by right-wing dogmatists. The pro-Brexit members of her parliamentary group hold sway. The PM has no option but to deliver an outcome that she doesn’t believe in but that is the only thing that matters to these colleagues.Last week, former foreign secretary and current unspeakable charlatan Boris Johnson wrote a newspaper column in which he stated that women wearing the burqa looked like letterboxes or bank robbers. It was a horrible example of Johnson thoughtlessly punching down.Regardless of whether Johnson’s words were a deliberate dog whistle to the far right or simply an example of a populist newspaper columnist trying, ineptly, to pep up his latest piece without considering the consequences, the reaction among those who share his pro-Brexit position has been informative.            The Prime Minister and the Conservative Party chairman may both have condemned Johnson’s language (only the latest, let’s not forget, in a line of nasty Johnsonian remarks that includes that time he wrote about “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”) but from Brexiteers there is nothing but support. The real story here, they insist, is that Johnson is standing up for free-speech. And, anyway, he was defending the right to wear the burqa, so who’s the bad guy here?The free speech argument, whether cynically deployed or not, is compelling. Our own rights in this regard depend on the rights of others to say things we might find offensive. But there is also a fairly compelling case that Islamophobia infects the Tory right. If one’s political life has been dominated by the beliefs of an isolationist nature, it’s likely that among one’s comrades will be those whose views are unpalatable.Labour’s anti-Semitism and the Conservatives’ Islamophobia are the twin consequences of ideologues taking control.            The rise of the ideologue has collided with a new tribalism among voters. Referendums on both Scottish independence and membership of the European Union have created deep divisions among voters. Politicians may talk of people coming together but not one of them believes that to be happening.This tribalism means supporters of both Labour and the Conservatives devote much of their time to devising ever more contorted explanations for why their preferred politician isn’t a raging anti-Semite or Islamophobe (or an all forms of racism racist).They organise “twitterstorms” where they agree to switch off the BBC or demand the resignation of this traitor or that heretic, and they grow ever more certain of their righteousness.Last week a former challenger for the position of deputy leader of the SNP won a court’s backing for his assertion that his pro-independence position should be regarded as a “philosophical belief” and duly protected in law.Councillor Christopher McEleny hasn’t done much for those in his party who wish us to believe that theirs is a peculiarly civic nationalism. Rather, he stands now as an example of the nationalist who believes in independence at any cost, the nationalist who’d live in a cave to be free.Those who truly believe in Corbyn or Brexit do so with all of the passion with which McEleny believes in Scottish independence. Their faith cannot be shaken by facts. If anything, any challenge to their beliefs sees them doubling down. Political campaigners begin to identify as persecuted minorities.Ideologues and their devoted followers excuse themselves from difficult debate. Their “computer says no” rigidity means there’s rarely room for nuance and never space to believe a political opponent might be acting in good faith. We’re trapped in a political stand-off between tribes whose faith is unshakeable. The prospect of progress lies wounded in the corner.Someone – perhaps John Maynard Keynes – once said that when the facts changed, he changed his mind.These days, politics is dominated by people who, when the facts change, prefer find a new explanation for why those facts are wrong."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782751.1534092519!/image/image.jpg","title":"princes street gardens barriers blocking views to be removed","story":"        Council chiefs have bowed to demands to remove huge barriers blocking views of Edinburgh Castle from Princes Street during the festivals.

Council leader Adam McVey has intervened after heritage campaigners and politicians demanded the removal of the barriers and expressed concerns about future use of the gardens once a new concert arena is created. A spokesman for the city council said officers would be meeting as soon as possible to look into ways of “improving the situation.”Green MSP Andy Wightman said: “Princes Street Gardens are common land. “Time to change the law and give citizens greater democratic control.”Mr McVey told his Twitter followers: “This is public space and these are public views.“Ticketed events cannot put up barriers which are to the detriment of the city.”            In a subsequent official statement, he added: “I’m deeply concerned that the special character of princes Street and the Gardens is being seriously undermined by the erection of these barriers. “While ticketed events can provide a strong use for the current facilites as we look to take forward a newly developed bandstand for the capital, these events cannot be to the detriment of the city. “I’ll be working with council officers to explore how we can remove these barriers as soon as possible to reinstate what are public views and I’ll be seeking assurances that this doesn’t reoccur for any future events.”The Cockburn Association, the city’s long-running heritage group, had mounted a campaign urging people to raise concerns over the barriers and future management of the gardens with the local authority.

Muir stormed to European Championships 1,500m gold with an incredible display of utter domination and, minutes later, Eilish McColgan won a silver medal in a remarkable 5,000m.            It was a first ever victory for Great Britain in the event and ended Muir’s wait to land a big one, 12 months after the agony of a hair’s breadth fourth place in the London world championships.            The 25-year-old from Milnathort, who is a double European indoor champion at 1,500m and 3,000m and took world indoor 1,500m silver earlier in the year, produced an awesome display of front-running to decimate the field, with team-mate Laura Weightman taking the bronze medal.It was the perfect end to a trying season for Muir, who qualified as a vet after completing final exams which saw her miss the Commonwealth Games. Just a few weeks ago she suffered the disappointment of missing out on Zola Budd’s 33-year-old British mile record when she finished fifth at the London Anniversary Games.The best of Europe had no answer for Muir’s class, however, as she made the break at the halfway mark. A lightning fast middle 800m in 2.03 had the Scot in firm control, with Weightman tucking in behind in what turned into that rarest of things - a true run middle distance race in a major final.With 200m to go it was clear that Muir had made no misjudgment as she streaked away for a brilliant gold in a swift time of 4:02.32.Weightman yielded silver to Sofia Ennaoui of Poland but the gritty Northumbrian, who along with the great Dame Kelly Holmes was the only Brit to have won a European 1,500m medal, held off Ireland’s Ciara Mageean to join Muir on the podium.            “I just knew the girls had a good finish so the longer I left it the riskier it would be so I just ran as hard as I could for the finish line,” said Muir. “It was great Laura could get in behind me too.“It was probably the most pressure I’ve been under in terms of the level of expectation to win, it was something new for me and I think I’ve handled it really well.“I’m just thankful for the support I’ve had from back home and here as well.”Muir’s brilliance was followed up by a fantastic silver for McColgan in the 5,000m, who took advantage of an extraordinary blunder by 10,000m champion Lonah Salpeter of Israel who mistakenly sprinted for the line a lap too early.            She had gone with red-hot favourite Sifan Hassan, who went on to take gold in a championship record of 14:46.13, but stopped with 400m to go, allowing McColgan to move past and secure silver in 14: 53.05. Salpeter went on to finish but finished fourth behind Yasemin Can of Turkey. Scotland’s Steph Twell was 11th.For 27-year-old McColgan it was a European medal which eluded her illustrious mother, the 1991 10,000m world champion Liz. The Dundonian follows Scotland’s Yvonne Murray, who won gold in Split back in 1990 when the equivalent women’s event was 3,000m. She also won bronze in Stuttgart 1986 and Helsinki in 1994.“Every time I come to these championships I sit in and sit in and then get outkicked,” said an overjoyed McColgan after the race. “The best for me is strong from the start. After doing all that work I thought ‘don’t let these girls pass you now, stick in’. I knew that I finish really strong and if I was in touching distance I could catch the Turkish and Israeli girls. But then, yeah, I don’t know what happened [with Salpeter]. I just thought go. I’m really happy.“I know that my mum and dad will be going crazy.

Muir Fulton, 45, from Doonfoot, Ayr, needed a cornea transplant after both eyes became infected.            He cut short his holiday and flew home after seeking help from an eye surgeon at Ayr Hospital.            Muir went for a morning swim, forgetting he had his contact lenses in and an infection spread behind the lens. Within hours it had begun to damage his eyes. By the next day he was struggling to see.Muir, of Doonfoot, Ayr,  went to a Spanish hospital but felt he was “getting nowhere” and, desperate, called the eye department at Ayr Hospital and spoke to eye surgeon, Mr Sathish Srinivasan.“He told me to cut my holiday short and fly home immediately.“I was struggling to see and knew I was going blind.”             Muir’s eyes were so badly infected that the thin membrane covering the eyeball, the cornea, was scarred by infection and blocked images passing through to the eye.Property developer Muir’s left eye became so infected it was in danger of bursting open, he says.He was admitted urgently to Ayr Hospital where he was given antibiotic eye drops every 30 minutes around the clock for four days. “I was warned that if the drops did not work, my left eye would be glued shut,” Muir added.            “Mr Srinivasan’s treatment saved it but I was still blind. My family had to take me everywhere. “Consultant ophthalmologist Mr Srinivasan said only a cornea transplant in his right eye offered hope and the chance of success was limited.Mr Srinivasan said: “We got a donor cornea from the national eye bank and I am delighted to say it has worked, against considerable odds.“Many people don’t know never to swim or indeed take a shower with contact lenses. It’s also easy to forget you are wearing them.” Muir could see as soon as the bandages came off.            “It was amazing. My sight had been saved,” he said.He is approaching the end of his 18-month treatment. Last week he was told that he will even be able to drive in a couple of weeks.His wife Eileen said: “I feared that Muir would be permanently blind and was on the point of calling the RNIB to assess our home and help us make it blind friendly.“We are hugely grateful for everything that has been done.”A spokeswoman for NHS Blood and Transplant said: “Corneas can be donated after death, no matter how old the person.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSunday 12 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser gets new owner but customers remain in dark over gift cards","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s still unclear what the status of the CVA is following the takeover.\n\nWhen asked for clarity on the status of its anchor tenant, Victoria Square declined to comment, stating that it does not comment on individual brands within the centre.\n\nThere is also uncertainty for people left holding gift vouchers, with staff in Belfast informing some customers yesterday that they would not be accepting them \"until further notice\".\n\nShoppers were quick to air their frustration on social media, but some said they had been able to redeem their vouchers online.\n\nJohn French, chief executive of The Consumer Council, said: \"If a new company buys over the business, it will be at the new company\u0027s discretion whether to honour gift cards or vouchers.\n\n\"If you have a House of Fraser gift card/voucher, you might like to check with the person who gave you the gift card or voucher to see if it was purchased using a credit or Visa card.\n\n\"Such purchases have additional protection and a full refund may be provided by the card issuer.\"\n\nMike Ashley had been in competition with the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Philip Day, to buy out the chain.\n\nSources said he could soon begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under his upmarket Flannels outlet.\n\nHe described the transaction as a \"massive step forward\" for his firm, adding: \"This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector.\n\n\"We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible. It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands.\n\n\"Our deal was conservative, consistent and simple.\n\n\"My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street.\"\n\nLike so many retail names, House of Fraser has fallen victim to the rise in discount stores and the shift in consumer habits from physical purchase to online shopping.\n\nAodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, believes House of Fraser\u0027s problems should be a warning for action to prevent the demise of the high street.\n\nHe said: \"This is a critical period for the retail industry, caused by a perfect storm of pressures including rising costs and new technology changing how people shop.\n\n\"How much more news like this will it take before we have action to support retailers by cutting the inequitable and antiquated business rates bill?\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37209027.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Nichola_mallon_ring.jpg","title":"mla loses ring on beach only for it to be found and returned 18","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Strangers even lent a helping hand with a metal detector only for their hunt to end without success. \n\n\"I came home distraught and felt awful ever since,\" she added.\n\n\"I cannot believe that 18 months later a lady would find it, her sister would post it on Facebook and my ring and I reunited. \n\n\"I can never thank Fiona Collins and her sister Amanda enough for finding it and for their honesty.\n\n\"Never Give Up Hope,\" she ended her post with. \n\nSpeaking to the Belfast , the MLA explained how the good fortune was all down to the weather. \n\nThe recent hot spell had burned away reeds leaving the ring to be found.\n\n\"It probably never would have been found only for the weather,\" the MLA added. \n\nBefore leaving the area the family left messages with those that had helped in case the ring showed up and then all of a sudden a text came out of the blue. After a few messages husband Brendan was dispatched back to Ballyliffen to retrieve the ring.\n\n\"We exchanged pictures and a description and even when she said \u0027yes\u0027 I didn\u0027t believe it until it was back on my finger. I never got my hopes up.\"\n\nLast week the Belfast  told the story of how a little boy helped reunite lost wedding and engagement rings with their owners after he was on a treasure hunt in Donegal. Again social media came to the fore to bring a happy ending. \n\n\n \nTreasure hunter Oliver (8) reunites lost engagement and wedding rings with grateful owner\n \n\n\n\"It just shows you to never give up hope,\" added Nichola. \n\n\"You hear these stories and you imagine it could happen to you, but you never believe it - you dream. We never replaced it.\n\n\"I know it\u0027s a engagement ring and they are sentimental to everyone. But I never had a say in picking it, Brendan did it all on his own and we thought it was lost for good.\n\n\"I\u0027m over the moon these things never happen to me.\"\n\nShe added: \"I can\u0027t thank Fiona and Amanda enough. It shows you the power of social media and that there are good honest people out there.\"\n\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) returnjs = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.1\u0027fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\n\n\n\nGOOD THINGS DO HAPPEN 18 months ago I lost my engagement ring on the beach at the play park in Ballyliffin.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"omagh bomb families told 20 years felt","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

of history and full of memory.\n\n\n\nI am sure for you, 20 years is more like 100 years\nJohn McKinney\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nOmagh Council chief executive at the time, John McKinney, said: “I am sure for you, 20 years is more like 100 years.”\n\nThe blast which ripped the heart out of this market town community happened just months after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which largely ended decades of conflict – but not entirely.\n\nThe single worst atrocity of the conflict was still to come, 29 killed by a massive car bomb which exploded in the busy main shopping street of the Co Tyrone town with inadequate warning.\n\nPolice had begun to evacuate the area, but were inadvertently shepherding people towards the site of the explosion, after the dissident republican bombers gave the wrong location.\n\nEyewitnesses at the time have recalled eerie quiet in the immediate aftermath and there was silence again 20 years later as Omagh gathered in mourning which has never really ended, justice never served, and the killers never caught.\n\nAmong those present was Justin Hughes, a dapper man, wearing a smart grey suit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Hughes’ twin sister Julie Hughes died in the Omagh bomb and he lay flowers and blinked back tears during Sunday’s commemoration (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe waited politely to allow other relatives to place their floral tributes ahead of him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was there to remember Julie Hughes, a 21-year-old accountancy student home from university in Scotland ahead of returning to complete her final year.\n\nShe was his twin sister.\n\nShe had a summer job working in a photographic shop and was evacuated due to the inaccurate warnings.\n\nMr Hughes gave his personal message among the flowers a quick kiss, then laid the bouquet on the edge of the reflective pool which forms the centre of the memorial garden, pausing only to gently adjust a white petal which protruded slightly.\n\nHe rose and walked a few steps, into the embraces – long and lingering – of his family.\n\nIt was a protracted hug, other family members looked on anxiously, one gave him a reassuring pat on the elbow and tilted her head close, unaware, for that moment, of other mourners passing by.\n\nMr Hughes blinked back the tears and dabbed his face with a handkerchief, receiving a peck on the cheek and an arm on the shoulder.\n\n\n\nI hope and pray that justice will be done in the future\nLeslie Matthews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nLeslie Matthews sang a piece called Our Special Absent Friends.\n\nHe said: “Three steps forward, two back.\n\n“I hope and pray that justice will be done in the future.”\n\nTwenty years after Omagh, Northern Ireland is in political limbo.\n\nWith powersharing at Stormont – the crown jewel of the 1998 peace agreement – suspended for months and endless rounds of negotiations unable to restore it, the future looks uncertain.\n\nMr McKinney recalled the sense of hope which surrounded the signing of the Belfast Agreement.\n\n“A hope for a better place.\n\n“A hope that we would grow together.\n\n“A hope for reconciliation.\n\n“Unfortunately, and I regret to say this, the reconciliation never really happened.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37208470.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/omagh_bomb_memorial_008.jpg","title":"omagh bombing relatives remember loved ones

through Omagh on August 15, 1998.\n\nThe victims came from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, England and Spain.\n\nThe atrocity was claimed by a republican splinter group which called itself the Real IRA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 people were killed in the 1998 bombing (Paul McErlane/PA)\n\n\n\n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable, George Hamilton, former Ombudsman Baroness Nuala

decision not to attend the 20th anniversary.\n\nIn a statement, Ms Bradley said: “I would like to express my deepest sympathy to those affected by the devastating Omagh bombing ahead of the 20th anniversary this week.\n\n“I hope today’s commemoration ceremony provides comfort to all those bereaved and is marked by hope and remembrance.\n\n“We must never forget the loss that the victims of

event by its musical director Daryl Simpson.\n\nThe choir includes Cara McGillion, 17, the daughter of Donna Marie and Garry who were left seriously injured in the attack.\n\nMichael Gallagher, whose son Aiden was among those killed, paid tribute to all the victims of the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict, including the La Mon hotel IRA bombing which killed members of a local collie club in 1978.\n\nThe service included speeches from victims campaigners from the US and was attended by Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable George Hamilton and a representative of the Irish Government, among others.\n\nRelatives of the dead sat opposite the reflecting pool at the memorial garden, their garlands of flowers reflected in the pool.\n\nA song was sung for Our Special Absent Friends.\n\nMr Gallagher said as a small province Northern Ireland was facing its greatest challenges ahead.\n\nHe called on the political parties to seek agreement “so that we can move forward”.\n\n“Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvictims of the Omagh bombing

He said the event was being led by young people in the area and they were unaware of the notice period required. \n\n\"This was a change from last year with new legislation introduced and it seems few people know about it,\" the told the Belfast . \n\n\"I\u0027ve been talking to other running clubs and organisers and it seems they were not aware of it either and it is certainly having a damaging effect right across the city. \n\n\"We have been engaged with the police and the council over the past two weeks. The local community police were very supportive but when they went to senior officers they came back to say there was three months\u0027 notice needed.\"\n\nThe route was to start at the roundabout before going down the Crumlin Road, across to the Shankill by Cambrai Street back to Hillview and up the Oldpark Road to Ardoyne for the finish and celebrations.\n\n\"Festival organisers and the local community are very angry and upset that this is being stopped giving all the recent events in north Belfast with homes being attacked and targeted including arranged fights. We want to build community relations and put a stop to this,\" continued Councillor McCusker. \n\n\"We have our own medical teams and risk assessments done. We need the police to assist at the junctions.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin priest stands aside amid investigation into historical allegations","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"olympic cyclist boardman speaks out over new road safety laws","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Wow, just wow. I  genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account.”\n\nUrging other cyclists to complain to Mr Norman and his party, he added: “It’s not me that needs to know how you feel – that’s me, with the dead mother, crushed to death by a car by the way. It makes me feel genuinely sick.”\n\nCarol Boardman died aged 75 when she was run over by a pick-up truck while on a bike ride near Connah’s Quay in north Wales.\n\nBBC radio presenter Jeremy Vine also spoke out about the Tory message.\n\n“When I’m on a bike, I’m a vulnerable road user,” said Vine.\n\n“In 2016 there were 1,700 road deaths three were caused by cyclists.”\n\n\nCoupla things.\n1. When I\u0027m on a bike, I\u0027m a vulnerable road user.\n2.

In 2016 there were 1,700 road deaths THREE were caused by cyclists. \npic.twitter/KbFHLaH1Hx\n\n— Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) \nAugust 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing that the tweet had been taken down, Mr Norman said: “It did not reflect either this set of policy announcements or the very careful work the Government has done to improve road safety for all users, including cyclists. On behalf of all involved, I would like to apologise.”\n\nMr Boardman said Norman was “one of the good guys, if only his party would empower him to do more”.\n\nIn recent weeks the Department for Transport has announced a series of measures to protect vulnerable road users, including:\n\n– Funding to give driving instructors training to ensure cyclists’ safety is prioritised.\n– Better investigation of crashes.\n– Investing £100 million to improve dangerous roads.\n\nThe latest announcement includes the introduction of national guidance for cycling and walking infrastructure and updating parts of the Highway Code to combat close passing of bicycles.\n\nMs Briggs’ widower Matthew supports the proposed new laws.\n\nHe said: “This public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences.”\n\nMs Briggs was killed by Charlie Alliston, then 18, who was travelling at 18mph on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes.\n\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in jail after being found guilty of causing bodily harm by “wanton and furious driving”.\n\nThe Victorian legislation, originally drafted to deal with reckless handling of horses, was used because there was no cycling equivalent to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Briggs was killed by teenage cyclist Charlie Alliston (politan Police/PA)\n\n\n\n\nDepartment for Transport (DfT) figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain’s roads, but only three cases involved bicycles.\n\nNational charity Cycling UK claimed a “full review of road traffic offences” is required.\n\nCycling UK head of campaigns Duncan Dollimore described the current system of prosecuting and sentencing for careless or dangerous drivers as “something of a lottery” which leaves victims and their relatives “feeling massively let down”.\n\n\n\nThey should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly\nCycling UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went on: “Adding one or two new offences specific to cyclists would be merely tinkering around the edges.\n\n“If the Government is serious about addressing behaviour that puts others at risk on our roads, they should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly, rather than attempt to patch up an area of legislation that’s simply not working.”\n\nMr Norman said: “All these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"widows of israeli athletes disturbed by corbyn pictures","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

In so many ways, enough is enough.”\n\nThe pictures emerged amid continuing controversy over Labour’s refusal to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, including a list of examples of anti-Semitic behaviour.\n\nThree senior union leaders have added their voices to calls from deputy leader Tom Watson for the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance text to be incorporated in its entirety into Labour’s new code of conduct on anti-Semitism.\n\nLabour has launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party’s ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: “The code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises its examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases.\n\n“The NEC upheld the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism, but in recognition of the serious concerns expressed, agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views.”\n\nWriting in the Sunday Mirror, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “Both Jeremy Corbyn and I have made clear that racism and anti-Semitism have no place in the Labour Party.\n\n“Labour will resolve any outstanding issues within our party and get out there to assist the Jewish community in fighting anti-Semitism and racism.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"these pictures suggest an effortlessly great photo is often exactly the opposite","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8143304.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"newtown first look for residents at 32m new","story":"\nAt the Mid Wales Housing Association preview event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown, ar\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gte Ffion Jones, aged \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtfive, and three-year-old Trystan Jones and Summer Jones, nine.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143330/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Nathan Pritchard, John Bowen, Dylan Pritchard, Lisa Davies, Madison Pritchard and Keira Davies.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143332/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Ffion Jones (5) and Trystan Jones (3) and Summer Jones (9)\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143333/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"presteigne carnival 2018 sunshine and live music added to the fun at","story":"\nPIC 10: THE Primary School’s Royal Wedding float in all its glory during the P\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtresteigne Carnival d\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtay parade.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143390/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 1: CARNIVAL Queen Sophie Preece after her crowning with attendants Phoebe Ka\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gttsaitis, Menna Baynh\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtam, Mair Thomas and Kameron Traylor.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143392/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 2: A BIG turnout by the Celtic Dragons Motorbike Club saw them joining the p\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtarade and staging a \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtstatic display on the Carnival Field before going on to present The Woodchoppers Ball at their headquarters The Woodchoppers Arms in Knighton R\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143393/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 3: PUPILS of Presteigne Primary School.
