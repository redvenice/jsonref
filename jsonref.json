For me it was almost surreal being there. I\u0027d dreamed of seeing this shipwreck and it took years of experience both in ing and photography to be able to safely capture the images I saw in my mind.\u0027Peering inside windows to see a piano still in place or a card table and chairs next to a fireplace with a clock hanging above it and the galley with gold rimmed china still sitting on the shelf is pretty spectacular.\u0027According to Becky, not many ers have the privilege of visiting the Gunilda thanks mainly to its remote location, its depth 270ft  under the water and chilly 38f3c temperatures.And she said she needed a team of very well-trained ers to be able to make the trip a success.

Witnesses said the female passenger sitting next to it was partially sucked out of the aircraft through the whole and had to be held down           This was the row of seats where the window was shattered. According to witnesses, passengers had to pull the woman back into the aircraft when she was sucked towards the window and some of her body was drawn through it          This was the view from on board the Southwest Airlines flight of the blown-out engine after the plane made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport. A piece of shrapnel from it flew backwards and shattered the window           The window that was shattered was behind the engine that exploded.

A huge thank you for her knowledge, guidance and bravery in a traumatic situation. God bless her and all the crew.\u0027Schults was one of the first female fighter pilots in the US Navy and first to fly an F-18. She later became an instructor, as the Navy did not allow women to fly in combat, and she finally resigned in 1993 when she joined Southwest Airlines. A mother-of-two, originally from New Mexico, Schults now lives with her husband Dean, a fellow pilot, in Fair Oaks Ranch, Texas.\u0027She has nerves of steel.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes and are used by all of Airbus A320 aircraft.          One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics           \u0027Heroes\u0027: Passengers thanked the five crew members on board for saving their lives. According to witnesses, the female pilot told them to brace for impact before she made the \u0027smooth\u0027 emergency landing  The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia. It was flying over western Pennsylvania at around 32,500ft at the time           The faulty engine was almost entirely exposed after the plane had landed The last time a passenger died in an accident on a U.S. airliner was 2009 when 49 people on board and one on the ground were killed when a Continental Express plane crashed on a house near Buffalo, New York.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s accident. It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The National Transportation Safety Board says a preliminary examination of the blown jet engine  shows evidence of \u0027metal fatigue.\u0027In a late night news conference, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades was separated and missing. Sumwalt says the blade was separated at the point where it would come into the hub and there was evidence of metal fatigue. He said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

A threat made to keep her story about then-businessman Donald Trump under wraps While many aspects of Daniel\u0027s liaison with the now-president had already come out in the press – thanks, in part, to the 2011 interview she did with In Touch Weekly, which the magazine didn\u0027t publish until this January – it was details about this threat that became the headline out of her 60 Minutes interview last month.   \u0027I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter,\u0027 she explained. \u0027And a guy walked up to me and said to me, Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.\u0027 \u0027And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, That\u0027s a beautiful little girl, it\u0027d be a shame if something happened to her mom. And then he was gone,\u0027 Daniels said. To 60 Minutes, Daniels said she did not report the encounter to police at the time because she was scared.She reiterated that point to The View\u0027s co-host Meghan McCain on Tuesday. \u0027I was scared, it was expressly what he told me not to do,\u0027 Daniels said of taking the threat to authorities. She also pointed out that if she had gone to the police a public record would have been produced and she likely would have had to explain that she had a previous alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which is why the threat took place.

I didn\u0027t want him to think I was a bad mom and I put our daughter in danger.\u0027 McCain asked why Daniels had never detailed the threat until the 60 Minutes interview, as the porn star had spoken off-the-record to news outlets, including ABC News, about her encounter with Trump, then running for president, in the weeks before the election.  The adult film actress replied that she didn\u0027t want to be asked the question McCain had just asked – why not call the cops?   \u0027I did tell quite a few people actually from back then,\u0027 Daniels then volunteered. \u0027I told family members and two friends and people that I worked with.\u0027  At that point Avenatti jumped in to say that there was no way his client could \u0027fabricate\u0027 the man\u0027s face. \u0027This is a very detailed sketch,\u0027 he said. He explained how the sketch had been made by a woman named Lois Gibson who often works with the FBI. \u0027She found Stormy to be very credible,\u0027 Avenatti added. Comey insists he didn\u0027t mock the size of Trump\u0027s hands in...Michael Cohen knows he could go to prison friend reveals as...Trump continues to struggle in search of new attorney to...Comey deepens mystery of \u0027classified information\u0027 that...Share this articleCo-host Joy Behar pointed out that the man \u0027looks like an actor, sort of.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what stood out to me because I thought, honestly, that he was, you know, sort of handsome,\u0027 Daniels said.  Avenatti had planned to release the drawing publicly last week, but the raid of Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u0027s office and hotel room delayed the unveiling.  \u0027Due to the FBI raids of Mr. Cohen’s officehome and a subsequent request we received this morning to delay the release of the forensic sketch of the thug that threatened Ms. Clifford to leave Trump alone, we will not be releasing the sketch or reward details today. Timing TBD,\u0027 Avenatti tweeted last week after the Monday morning raid.Cohen was responsible for giving Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement that barred her from talking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Avenatti has made a number of legal maneuvers to prevent Daniels from having to pay damages for violating the NDA, which the lawyer had argued is invalid since Trump never signed on as a party. Cohen, for his part, has said he paid Daniels personally, and Trump has backed that account up. \u0027Let me just say, I work in the adult business and I\u0027m a better actress than he is,\u0027 Daniels replied to a clip The View played showing Trump denying he knew about the hush money payment.  The longtime Trump fixer was in federal court Monday trying to prevent prosecutors from examining the content seized from the FBI\u0027s raid on Cohen\u0027s properties a week before. Daniels and Avenatti showed up at the hearing and then spoke to press waiting outside. \u0027For years Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump\u0027s fixer. He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,\u0027 Daniels told the crowd. \u0027He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.\u0027 \u0027That ends now,\u0027 the porn star said. \u0027My attorney and me are committed to making sure that everyone finds out the truth and the facts of what happens, and I give my word that we will not rest until that happens,\u0027 Daniels said. Pointing to Daniels\u0027 appearance outside the courtroom today, McCain said she thought it looked like a publicity stunt, mentioning how Daniels seemed to be benefiting financially from the headlines, as she\u0027s embarked on a \u0027Make America Horny Again\u0027 strip club tour.\u0027Can I say, first of all, I did not name the tour,\u0027 she said, calling the name \u0027awful\u0027 and explaining how a strip club owner in the Carolinas dubbed her appearance there after the Trump campaign slogan. \u0027I\u0027m making more money, but I\u0027m spending so much more. My daughter, we have to hire a tutor now. And I have like bodyguards. You don\u0027t even want to know their food bill, because I have to feed them three times a day, and they are big,\u0027 Daniels said to laughs. \u0027Yes, I am dancing more, yes, I am making more money, but I am spending more money.\u0027 Daniels said that her ambition was not to move out of the adult film industry using the money from her scandal, but instead had wanted to keep growing as a director. \u0027I had a passion project of mine in the works for the last several years to direct a horror movie and those people that were my investors completely abandoned me,\u0027 Daniels said. Without a beat, Behar asked, \u0027Will Trump be in the movie?\u0027  McCain also asked what the end game was for the porn star.\u0027On a selfish note, it is my chance to defend myself and make people realize how and why this happens, so I can tell my side,\u0027 Daniels replied. \u0027That is my selfish reason, not going to lie about that part.\u0027  Avenatti chimed in too saying, \u0027We want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u0027  \u0027You should not be afraid or bullied,\u0027 Daniels added.  Stormy Daniels gives tell-all interview, poses nude for Penthouse | Page Six"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/07/4B4269A200000578-5627145-Matthew_Foster_a_meteorologist_with_the_National_Weather_Service-a-20_1524032729078.jpg","title":"Over 200 Hawaii residents airlifted Kauai flooding","story":"More than 200 people were airlifted to safety on Monday by the US Army, National Guard and the country, officials said    The storm, which hit Saturday, dumped 28.1 inches of rainfall in the small North Shore town of Hanalei, on the island of Kauai, in the  of 24 hours          Matthew Foster, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu, a storm is headed towards Kauai Wednesday night into Thursday  The second storm is expected to bring heavy rains, which could mean more flooding in areas that were already devastated by Saturday\u0027s storm  Germaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave Harry8-year-old girl raped and murdered a wedding in IndiaMoment Theresa May appears to roll her eyes at Jeremy CorbynBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureTerrifying moment surfer is mauled by four-metre great white sharkTwo surfers have been mauled by great white shark just hours apartDrug smugglers caught at Heathrow trying to move £16m of cocaine\u0027Why would I help her?\u0027 Cate Campbell admits to being selfishWindrush Scandal: NHS worker talks about facing deportationMet Office forecasts warm weather to hit the UK this weekAir traffic control audio from Southwest Airlines flight 1380Foster said the storm, however, won\u0027t stick around as long as the storm over the weekend did.

Normal chewing puts between 20lb and 40lb of pressure on your teeth, but grinding or clenching can exert a force equivalent to an astonishing 300lb.It’s enough pressure to crack a walnut shell — and teeth-grinders can be doing it for as much as 40 minutes of every hour they’re asleep.          According to my boyfriend, who had to contend with me making an awful gnashing noise in my sleep, I did. But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache? (pictured: Lara King)No wonder it can take its toll on teeth, wearing them down and causing them to crack, break or become more sensitive.It’s also not uncommon for problems to surface in the neck, shoulders and back as the jaw muscles become so tight that pain is referred to other parts of the body.Teeth-grinding can even be behind a range of symptoms as varied as vertigo and hearing loss, by triggering inflammation in the inner-ear muscles.It can ruin your looks, too. ‘If someone grinds a lot you can sometimes see it in their face, because the muscles increase in size from overwork,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, aesthetic dentist and director at London Smiling Dental Group.‘It’s like building up your biceps with weights. You end up with more muscle mass in the face and jaw.’The result can be a square face, bulging hamster cheeks or ‘lantern jaw’ — a long, thin jaw with a prominent chin.          Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the triggerA British Medical Journal study also found that a loss of lower facial height due to teeth wearing down can make you appear as much as 20 years older.With all of that to worry about, it’s a wonder we ever sleep at all.So what causes teeth-grinding? The experts are agreed: stress.Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the trigger. Dr Patel’s practice has seen cases of bruxism rocket by 30 per cent in five years as our lives become increasingly high-pressured.Most of her patients are women, but Dr Patel has also started treating children as young as 11.She says: ‘When some people are stressed they break out in spots, or get rashes or stomach upsets. Others grind their teeth.’If you think a glass of wine before bed will relax you, think again. Not only does alcohol reduce deep sleep, making grinding more likely, but Andrew Eder, a professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, says that acidic drinks such as prosecco and white wine soften enamel so it’s more easily worn away through grinding.For me, two-and-a-half years after that rather painful lunch, teeth-grinding is a nightly battle that has left me with a fissure in one tooth, a clicky jaw and bouts of neck stiffness, headaches and jaw pain.And while the experts say that a spell of stress is likely to have triggered my grinding in the first place, they also warn that once it starts, it can become habitual. When I visit Dr Patel, she tells me that it’s left a line of dentine (hard, dense, bony tissue) visible on the edges of my top and bottom teeth — showing that I’ve worn away the enamel.Enamel can’t be replaced, and losing it raises the risk of cavities, decay and infection. I take good care of my teeth and pride myself on having no fillings, so it’s infuriating that something I’m doing when I’m sound asleep is damaging them.Still, it seems I’m one of the luckier ones. Emily Mason’s grinding was so severe she destroyed one tooth entirely and had to endure a root canal treatment.Emily, a 37-year-old communications consultant from Wokingham in Berkshire discovered she was grinding her teeth three years ago. ‘I had a lot of pain in what seemed to be every single one of my teeth,’ she says. ‘My entire mouth was aching constantly. I felt like I was going mad, because I just couldn’t get to the bottom of what was causing it.’Her husband Chris, 36, hadn’t noticed Emily was grinding her teeth, but her dentist eventually spotted the signs. In an attempt to stop it, Emily had three of her molars filed down, as her dentist suggested it would make her bite more even and let all of her teeth take the force of the grinding, rather than just one or two. But it wasn’t enough.‘Things came to a head last year when I had to have a root canal.‘I had clamped my teeth so hard together on such a regular basis that I had stopped the blood supply to a tooth. I was mortified that I’d allowed the situation to get to that point.’Emily admits she’s a ‘natural worrier’, but says: ‘I’m not sure what triggered it. I work full-time and have two young sons — Archie, seven, and four-year-old Rufus — and I don’t live near my family, which means the school run, helping at Beaver Scout group and generally being a taxi service all falls to me.‘But that’s nothing out of the ordinary for most mums.’In an attempt to break the cycle, she is now having her teeth straightened at a cost of £3,500.‘My dentist told me many of his patients who have done this notice they’re clenching less,’ she explains.‘If the alignment isn’t perfect, people may grind and clench their teeth trying to find a comfortable way for the upper and lower teeth to sit together.’Her Invisalign braces — clear plastic aligners that sit snugly over the teeth — will also offer her some protection.‘They will create a barrier and stop my teeth from hitting one another when I do grind,’ says Emily.Mouthguards worn at night are most dentists’ first course of action — but they can do more harm than good. Experts warn that the soft plastic variety that can be bought over the counter actually encourage grinding by inducing a chewing response.Dr Okoye recommends patients have a hard ‘splint’ mouthguard custom-made at a cost of up to £1,000. But even at that price, it won’t last for ever.‘The hardest substance in the human body is enamel, and if that’s ground away there’s no manmade thing I can replace it with that you won’t chomp away at, too,’ admits Dr Okoye.And while guards shield the teeth from damage, they can’t stop the grinding action, so a guard won’t necessarily alleviate the other symptoms.In desperation, more and more women are turning to radical treatments — including Botox. Tracey Jones, 49, a personal assistant, has spent at least £3,000 over the past five years on chiropractors and physiotherapists to try to relieve agonising pain in her back, neck and shoulders.Two years ago, her dentist diagnosed bruxism and said it was likely she’d been grinding for over a decade. He gave Tracey, from Cheshire, a mouthguard, but she says it didn’t stop the muscles clenching.Tracey, who is married with two grown-up daughters, is now trying Botox. More commonly used to smooth away wrinkles, the chemical is injected into the skin where it partially paralyses muscles. The theory is that injecting it into the muscles in the jaw reduces their activity.‘I had the treatment in September,’ Tracey says. ‘It took just five minutes and the effects last up to six months — although it takes ten days to start working.‘Each session costs £550, but today I estimate that I’m 85 per cent better than I was before.‘I’m sleeping through the night without interruption and when I wake up I’m no longer in pain.‘Fortunately it hasn’t affected my ability to chew or eat as it affects a different set of muscles.’But experts are ided on the safety of Botox for teeth-grinding, pointing to evidence that it may eat away at the jawbone.Our bones constantly regenerate, and rely on impact and muscle movement to produce new bone cells. When the jaw muscle’s activity is reduced by Botox, it can’t push and pull the jaw as powerfully, hampering the process.One study suggests a single treatment could trigger a loss of bone density of as much as 40 per cent, increasing the risk of teeth becoming loose or even falling out.So how can you tell if you’re grinding? Professor Eder says to ask your dentist to look for the tell-tale signs: ‘You’ll normally see a white horizontal line inside the cheeks, just adjacent to where the teeth meet, in people who are actively grinding.‘You may also see indentations on either side of the tongue.‘Eventually, worn teeth can become more sensitive, get sharp at the edges, chip and become shorter.’ Ultimately, the question remains: How do we stop something that we’re doing while we’re asleep?Perhaps part of the answer is not worrying about it too much. Dr Okoye says: ‘We used to try to cure people of teeth-grinding, but we now realise we can’t.

Institute in Canada asked 34 people to copy simple melodies created at random by computer and to sing an ascending scale, hitting the highest note possible, as well as a descending scale to the lowest note they could reach.Excluding the six people who could not whistle, the results show people\u0027s singing was less precise than their whistling.The study, led by Dr Michel Belyk, from Bloorview Research Institute and the University of Maastricht, states: \u0027Despite the vocal virtuosity of humans relative to other apes, there is a population of iniduals- colloquially referred to as \u0027tone deaf\u0027- who are notable in their poor abilities as singers.\u0027However, tone deafness is a misnomer, as these iniduals do not necessarily have a deficit in hearing musical sounds, but rather in singing them.\u0027           Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a questionThe results of the study help to explain why even virtuoso opera singers cannot match musical instruments like the violin for perfect pitch. While humans have a direct pathway from the brain to the larynx not seen in other great apes, they seem to have problems using it completely accurately.The study authors recruited people who self-identified as good and bad singers to copy the two sets of 45 melodies created by computer within a single octave. They did so in a sound chamber with a microphone, with software picking up mistakes in their ability to match the notes they heard.The results show people who could whistle precisely were also better able to sing precisely. Notes which were sung, using a single vowel rather than words in the study, were more likely to be flat and whistled notes to be sharp.World\u0027s first singing road that plays German regional anthem...Share this articleBut c, according to the research published in the study Royal Society Open Science.The study states: \u0027Sung imitations were less precise than whistled imitations, although neither were on the order of precision that have previously been reported for continuous pitch instruments, such as the violin.\u0027 The results may show why our nearest relatives, the great apes, have the vocal abilities to blow raspberries and whistle but cannot sing.Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a question. However the ancient relatives we share with the apes mastered the lips before the larynx, which is why we may not be perfect at this.The authors conclude: \u0027From the relatively recent evolution of vocal production learning in great apes, we suggest that evolution has not tuned the human vocal-motor

abusers.Children’s charity the NSPCC said that the dark web and the use of disguised websites were ‘fuelling’ child abuse and allowing predators to offend at a ‘mass scale’.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027He should never have been allowed back to his...Share this articleDisguised websites can only be accessed if a specific online pathway is followed. For example, a person would be directed to a hidden page from a forum discussing child abuse. But if another web user, who has not been on a child abuse site previously, clicks on the page, they could come up with legitimate adult content instead.The problem is booming with the rise of technology and a ‘comprehensive strategy’ required to stop ‘offenders in their tracks’, the NSPCC has said.A spokesman said: ‘Social networks must ensure that they prioritise child protection and we need the Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, to step in and end the Wild West of the Web.’ The IWF found 78,589 URLs featuring disturbing content last year - a 37 per cent rise compared to 2017. The number of child sexual abuse websites had also exploded by 112 per cent.The figure had soared partly because its staff had become better at finding the horrific content, the charity said. Every seven minutes, the IWF finds footage of a child being sexually abused.          The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which produced the report, said there are more sites hosting child abuse than ever before - soaring by 37 per cent in the last year - with the NSPCC calling on Culture Secretary Matt Hancock to ‘step in and end the Wild West of the web’Fresh imagery was being regularly produced in addition to the historic content being shared again and again.Alarmingly, the charity is also finding more videos of children aged 11 to 15 who create footage of themselves on a webcam and then share it online.‘The amount of content that is out there is always growing, it’s never going to reduce,’ the IWF’s deputy CEO Mr Langford said.Around a third of the material uncovered featured the most severe abuse - category A which includes the rape and sexual torture of children.People were ‘seeking out something just a little bit more extreme’, Mr Langford said, adding: ‘Once the demand is there, the supply follows.’ Writing in the report’s foreword, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was ‘clearly more we need to do’, while noting that there was ‘worrying rise’ of material hosted in Europe.Offenders were ‘exploit(ing) new vulnerabilities in the online environment to evade detection’, she said. ‘We will continue to work together in our efforts to rise to this challenge and to evolve with it as we look to ensure the UK’s response remains as strong as it can possibly be,’ she added.Her comments came as IWF’s research found that 65 per cent of child sex abuse imagery was being produced in Europe - with the Netherlands as the top host.Mr Langford, IWF’s deputy chief, said abusers were ‘goading’ each other on through the web to post more graphic content with more extreme images granting greater ‘kudos’.‘In the same was as I suppose an international drug deal might say I’m shipping more drugs than you...These people have got that same sort of mentality…It becomes: “I’ve got more extreme content that you”,’ he told the Mail.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Cambridge-based charity, said: ‘This year we’re seeing offenders getting smarter and finding new ways to abuse legitimate internet services.’ She said it was ‘concerning’ that more disguised websites were being used to evade the authorities.‘We are making huge technological advances, which we’ll be announcing later in the year, but we also need to continue to work globally, in partnership, to fight this disturbing crime. This battle cannot be won in isolation,’ she added."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/06/4B45781300000578-5628465-image-m-42_1524028623413.jpg","title":"Is Stormy Daniels hinting secrets come","story":"    Stormy Daniels has sparked a new controversy - this time with her choice of jewelry           The porn star has sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories after she wore a silver key pendant during her latest appearance on The View on Tuesday          She was on the show to discuss her alleged affair with the presidentOn Monday, she wore the same key necklace as she attended the court hearing for Michael Cohen, the lawyer who is accused of paying her off to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump.Some people are questioning whether the porn star, who claims she had a secret affair with Trump while his wife Melania was pregnant with their son Barron, are hinting that there is more to come out in the scandal.Others suggest it could be showing that she plans to keep the remaining details under lock and key. Continuing to weather the Stormy! First Lady Melania Trump...Stormy Daniels\u0027s Penthouse cover is revealed as she poses in...Share this article    On Monday, she wore the same key necklace as she attended the court hearing for Michael Cohen, the lawyer who is accused of paying her off to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump          Her necklace featured a long silver key which appears to feature the Mars male symbol and a key tipWhile one Twitter user suggested that the necklace could be suggesting that the courts should lock up attorney Cohen, and that she could be the key.Whatever the reason, it appears Daniels still has plenty to say about Donald Trump.On Tuesday on The View, Daniels unveiled the sketch of the man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, after she tried to publicize her story about an alleged affair with Donald Trump.  She told the panel that the man approached her as she was getting her infant daughter out of the car to attend a mommy-and-me exercise class.\u0027I noticed him because he was sort of well-dressed and nothing about him alarmed me,\u0027 she told the women in her first live television interview since the hush money payment given to Daniels by President Trump\u0027s lawyer Michael Cohen was unveiled. \u0027I really thought he was somebody\u0027s husband not wanting to be in whatever his wife was doing.\u0027            Upon unveiling the sketch, Daniels\u0027 attorney Michael Avenatti said they would pay a  $100,000 reward for the identity of the man, and asked for tips to be sent to IDTheThug@gmail.com. \u0027We want to get to the bottom of who this is, and we think we know who this is, but we want to confirm it,\u0027 Avenatti told The View\u0027s audience. Stormy was also at the court hearing for Trump\u0027s lawyer Cohen on Monday.Cohen was responsible for giving Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement that barred her from talking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Avenatti has made a number of legal maneuvers to prevent Daniels from having to pay damages for violating the NDA, which the lawyer had argued is invalid since Trump never signed on as a party. Cohen, for his part, has said he paid Daniels personally, and Trump has backed that account up.           Porn star Stormy Daniels is photographed entering the studios for The View, as she gives her first live television interview           Porn star Stormy Daniels revealed the sketch that was made of the man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, after she went to the press with her story of having sexual relations with then-businessman Donald Trump \u0027Let me just say, I work in the adult business and I\u0027m a better actress than he is,\u0027 Daniels replied to a clip The View played showing Trump denying he knew about the hush money payment.  The longtime Trump fixer was in federal court Monday trying to prevent prosecutors from examining the content seized from the FBI\u0027s raid on Cohen\u0027s properties a week before. Daniels and Avenatti showed up at the hearing and then spoke to press waiting outside. \u0027For years Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump\u0027s fixer. He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,\u0027 Daniels told the crowd. \u0027He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.\u0027 \u0027That ends now,\u0027 the porn star said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/11/4B46CC6300000578-5628685-image-a-98_1524045751653.jpg","title":"Dig sunglasses Britain set sizzle 77F heat TODAY","story":"    Kitty Lam, 34, sunbathes in Regent\u0027s Park.

User @huonoliver, who visited the cafe, was surprised by the presentation. Commenting it was “tasty but ridiculous” he posted a picture to his account. That was picked up by Brown Cardigan which ran a photo, hashtagged #notmyvegemite, and Reddit lit up with talk of the latest in deconstructed food.One article scolded “Give yourself an uppercut, Sydney,” and Novocastrians were for once hesitant to correct. So Guardian Australia decided to do a taste test.Ordering at Core Espresso brought instant suspicion. In this heightened climate it felt like asking for tickets to a peep show. The head barista, Danni Kerr, had just taken a call from local radio, network news was circling and websites were calling the dish “beyond ridiculous”, the final frontier in hipsters disappearing up their own self-indulgence.“So, one Vegemite on toast then?” Kerr asked.They’ve stopped using wooden boards to serve the dish. There were complaints, Kerr said, that condiments on boards were “unhygienic”. As the now famous toast clunked down before Guardian Australia on a plate, it was hard to shake the feeling of arriving in Pisa to find a long-overdue program of corrective works.Aside from “that is a disgrace” and “looks like the chef slipped on a dog turd”, critics claim the extra time it takes to distribute one’s own butter and Vegemite must surely deplete crucial toast warmth, resulting in an unmelted disappointment.This can be debunked. Rather than the kind of butter that spreads like Gumption, this stuff is shaped in a quenelle.  The diner may find him or herself lathering on too much butter (seven bucks is seven bucks) which, like a gambler chasing his losses, he must then match with Vegemite.Guardian Australia was overcome by the dosage. Kerr nodded knowingly.“Everyone has a very specific ratio of Vegemite, butter and toast. That’s the idea,” she said.  “There’s lots of very offended people but it’s just toast. Come on.” The price is hard to swallow but justified by the sourdough. It is at once crispy and soft and sourced from a Vietnamese bakery. And then there are the sprinkled “micro herbs”.Earlier Guardian Australia took the precaution of making its own version of the dish – a sort of a placebo in this highly scientific test.The available Woolies loaf at home tasted as brown bread does. The old Vegemite jar was swirled with margarine and a shard of breadstick, like the tusk of a mammoth preserved in tar.A nub of fridge butter melted pleasingly into the toast. A few leaves of rocket stood in for the micro herbs but were quickly discarded.If food is there to switch off the brain signal that says “hungry”, a homemade Vegemite toast will do. But there are those who see a Jackson Pollock and declare “I could make that!” Maybe on canvas, plate and board, some of us are destined to miss the point.Core Espresso Vegemite toast for $7.

Seven other people were injured in the incident.The pilot of the plane, a twin-engine Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people onboard, took it into a rapid descent and made an emergency landing in Philadelphia as oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers braced for impact.Photos posted by passengers showed a heavily damaged window near the damaged engine. In an audio recording of the exchange with air traffic controllers, the crew member is heard to say the plane needs to slow down and an unidentified crew member reports that there is a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.Riordan was well known in New Mexico, where she had built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications after graduating from the University of New Mexico.Gov Susana Martinez called her “an incredible woman who put her family and community first” and said her loss would be felt across the state.“The hearts of all New Mexicans are with the Riordan family,” Martinez said in a statement on Tuesday. In an email to parents, Amy McCarty, the assistant principal of Albuquerque Catholic school, wrote: “The family needs all the prayers we can offer.”Passengers praised the pilot who brought the plane to safety. Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas, lauded Tammie Jo Shults and her crew for their professionalism. “She has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card I’m going to tell you that with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”Shults was among the first female fighter pilots in the US military, according to friends and the alumni group at Shults’ alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene. Her brother-in-law, Gary Shults, said her husband was also a Southwest pilot and told him she had made the emergency landing. “She’s a formidable woman, as sharp as a tack,” said Gary Shults, a dentist in San Antonio. “My brother says she’s the best pilot he knows. She’s a very caring, giving person who takes care of lots of people.” Passengers said she walked through the aisle and talked with them to make sure they were OK after the plane touched down. The US transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, extended her sympathies to the Riordan’s loved ones and praised the pilot, crew and others who were onboard. “I commend the pilots who safely landed the aircraft, and the crew and fellow passengers who provided support and care for the injured, preventing what could have been far worse,” Chao said in a statement. The US National Transportation Safety Board chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said it was the first passenger fatality in an accident involving a US airline since 2009. A preliminary examination of the blown jet engine has shown evidence of “metal fatigue”, according to the board. Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed flight 1380 was heading west over New York’s southern tier at about 32,200ft and traveling at 500mph when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia.Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York, said everyone started shouting to brace for impact when the plane started to land. Everyone clapped and praised the pilot after she set the aircraft down.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed. And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”She said she was seated near the back of the plane and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask. Some passengers were in tears and others shouted words of encouragement.“You had a few passengers that were very strong,” she said, “and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this.’”Bourman said she also saw a man in a cowboy hat rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Riordan was the vice-president for community relations at the Wells Fargo bank and was in charge of managing employee volunteer and board service to non-profit groups in New Mexico and parts of Texas. She also served on numerous boards and oversaw the annual United Way community campaign. The Albuquerque mayor, Tim Keller, said his thoughts and prayers were with Riordan’s family. “Today, Albuquerque lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community,” Keller said in a statement.

But the significance of this move is global – and it concerns Europe in many ways. China has identified a “window of historic opportunity” for itself across the world. To make the best of this, so its logic goes, the country must be united and disciplined under a strong leader and supreme commander. Xi has been compared with Mao Zedong in that he’s created an entirely leader-centric political system – but to think this has consequences only for China risks missing the wider picture.In my country, the Czech Republic, we’ve seen up close how China intends to expand its reach. Central Europe is very much part of China’s ambition to “move to the centre of the world stage” – the expression used by Xi during last year’s Communist party congress. The basic tool China relies on is the Belt and Road initiative, a trade and infrastructure project ning Asia and Europe which encapsulates the regime’s overarching foreign policy goals, in what Xi has dubbed the “new era”.The Belt and Road initiative is often misunderstood in Europe, not least because it keeps changing its name from one confusing moniker to another. Originally called the New Silk Road in 2013, it soon changed its name to One Belt, One Road, only to be rebranded as Belt and Road, apparently because the word “one” sounded unduly hegemonistic. While layers of propaganda often make it impenetrable to outside observers, its impact is very real – and growing. The project has been showcased with pompous rhetoric and music videos, and more than 60 countries have agreed to join.But how has it affected us Czechs? I run a project that monitors China’s attempts to build its “smart” power through a nexus of business, political and media networks. In Europe, there’s arguably no fonder ally of Beijing than the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, a populist who was re-elected earlier this year. He is on record calling Xi his “young friend”, and Belt and Road “the most remarkable initiative in modern human\u0026nbsphistory”.A tipping point came in 2014 when the Czech government proclaimed that the country would aspire to become “China’s gateway to Europe”. This amounted to a major foreign policy change. It broke entirely with\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsppro-democracy principles and support for Chinese dissidents of Václav Havel, the hero of the 1989 Velvet Revolution who went on to become president. Havel saw clear parallels between the\u0026nbsppast struggles of dissidents behind the iron curtain in Europe, and those\u0026nbspof contemporary Chinese dissidents – in particular\u0026nbspthe Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 declaration was directly inspired by Charter 77, the Czechoslovak anti-communist movement.With Zeman, the contrast couldn’t be starker. Here was the Czech Republic displaying total complacency about a regime that not only imprisoned Liu but denied him external medical help as his health dramatically deteriorated (he died last year). However, things went much further than just political signalling. By 2015, Zeman had named as his honorary adviser Ye Jianming, the chairman of a mysterious Chinese mega-company: CEFC, which had arrived in the Czech Republic promising billions of dollars of investments.CEFC embarked on what resembled a shock-and-awe buying spree, announcing it would scoop up stakes in travel services, an airline company, a brewery, a football club and a media group. It also lost no time hiring scores of former Czech elected officials, who often double as advisers at various ministries, or indeed within the presidential castle.As time passed, however, actual investments remained negligible. The few deals that did materialise were mostly real estate acquisitions.\u0026nbspThen last month, Ye suddenly ran into trouble in Beijing. News broke that he’d been arrested and come under investigation for financial irregularities. Prior to that, last November, the\u0026nbsphead of CEFC’s non-profit arm, the former Hong Kong politician Patrick Ho, was arrested in New York and accused of bribing presidents and government ministers in Africa.Ye’s disappearance obviously raised eyebrows in Prague. Zeman reacted by sending three close colleagues on a strange semi-private fact-finding mission to China. They came back with the information\u0026nbspthat the heavily indebted CEFC would effectively be\u0026nbsptaken over by the Chinese state, together with its Czech acquisitions. So much for the hopes that the company would save the Czech economy as a private investor.These awkward developments for Zeman have since prompted a debate about the wisdom of tying the country’s future to mysterious Chinese entities and to the Communist regime in Beijing.It might have helped to look more carefully before accepting Beijing’s embrace. Some of the metaphors Chinese media have attached to the Belt and Road project are revealing. They often call it “globalisation 2.0”, or the “New World Order”. What that vocabulary struggles to mask is that the whole endeavour is driven far more by politics than by markets.Deals are negotiated at state-to-state diplomatic summits. Open tenders are shunned. Contracts are awarded by political fiat. Ostensibly commercial companies put former politicians on their payrolls by the dozen. As it turns out, CEFC’s main investments in the Czech Republic weren’t economic, they were about buying up the loyalty of Czech officials. What China has\u0026nbspto show for itself in my country is hardly innovation. Rather, it has brought us a new take on age-old crony\u0026nbspcapitalism.• Martin Hala is a Czech academic in Prague and director of the China studies project Sinopsis.cz"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed77415370f1beeb1449f373865a79a67632f4b/0_130_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d67b9c2a5e04a5f4f3faa6cf7e493893 1240w","title":"commonwealth global climate change new zealanders","story":"The task ahead is immense, but New Zealanders know it can be achieved. We have a proud history of this kind of leadershipLeaders of Commonwealth nations are meeting in London this week instead of the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu because things did not go according to plan. In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches.In only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation’s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.Vanuatu is one of New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours and friends – and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents – the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm.Such extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge.The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year’s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action.And while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate.We were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.That is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law.Our plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 – setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon.We are also active in building international cooperation on climate action.Nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers’ yields and build resilience while reducing emissions.Alongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality.The international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to.At this week’s Commonwealth meeting, I’ll be thinking about Vanuatu’s experience – and the summit that couldn’t happen. I’ll also be guided by a Māori saying from my country – Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri, ā muri ake nei – for us and for our children after us.That is what’s at stake when we talk about climate change – the world we’ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage.• Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister of New Zealand"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef46c2e8ee79e5c743fa8f95c2a80eeeb8385a4/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7ace255b428bfa8549f74946b7160919 1240w","title":"should i live london google","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Our writers answer some of the commonest queriesAccording to films – yes. But if you move to W11 thinking you’ll nab a cute one-bed on a bookseller’s salary and bump into Julia Roberts, well, think again. The average flat price in Notting Hill is currently £890,000 according to (shudder) Foxtons. Julia Roberts is based in Malibu. And there are just an estimated 112 independent bookshops left in London. I am afraid that, as with a lot of big cities, living in London is a bit like playing roulette. Some win big, some struggle to catch a break. Either way, there is always someone waiting to take your place.Why live in London? Some feel they have to. Mostly this is for work. It goes without saying that for national political careers, one must be London-based, as the Houses of Parliament are situated in Westminster. In the media, all of the big national papers are located in London, as are the majority of broadcasters, and the regional press is struggling. The City of London is the world’s financial capital (there’s an annual arm wrestle in a cocktail bar with Wall Street bankers to maintain the title). Hospitality, tourism and services are all booming. In fact, London’s economy, as it is never tires of boasting, props up the whole of the UK – and grows at twice the national rate. There are signs, however, of shifts. Birmingham is a growing financial hub and Channel 4 has been given a government deadline to move from the capital. The BBC moved a chunk of its production to Salford (Greater Manchester) in 2011. The “northern powerhouse”, who knows, might grow to be an actual thing rather than a line repeated in every speech circa 2015, and the election of the regional “metro” mayors has gone some way towards devolving power. Some things, though, are moving further afield: post-Brexit, the European Medicines Agency moved to Amsterdam. But London is still “where it is at”. For culture vultures, London is a heaven inside a ring-road. There are an estimated 241 theatres and more than 250 registered art galleries and museums. London is the birthplace of punk and grime. For foodies, there are 72 Michelin-starred restaurants in the capital, and thousands of local cafes and establishments that are the gems of their own communities. The Turkish restaurants on Green Lanes are said to be some of the best in Europe. Marie’s Cafe on Lower Marsh is a new genre – Thai greasy spoon. For lovers of scenery, Hampstead Heath offers one of the UK’s most beautiful spaces. The city’s history rises like damp from the underground (the first tube journey took place in 1863) and floats to the surface of the Thames (where, no biggie, woolly mammoths used to quench their thirst).London state schools, once a significant cause for concern, are now among the best in the UK after a transformation effort (noticeably the London Challenge in 2003) that is studied around the world. The Times Higher Education rankings put 20 of the top 93 UK universities in London, which makes London’s 400,000 student population understandable.As for crime, London by many measures is not worse than the rest of the UK. Though a recent surge in knife crime has caught attention, its homicide level is not the highest in the UK for its population size (that would be Greater Manchester) and a lot of people who think of London as a big scary kraken of crime have never lived in London.So, the answer to the question: should you live in London? Well, I apologise for sounding like a life coach but it depends on who you are, and what you want in life. If you are someone who enjoys a leisurely stroll during rush hour and takes a relaxed attitude to escalator etiquette, absolutely not. If you are a burgeoning family already based in London, with a need for a garden and, struggling on a budget of what elsewhere would be a very sizeable sum of money, perhaps. (If, however, you’re the type of parent who enjoys, say, baby raves, then, yeah … stay in London.) If you are an immigrant, consider it: more than 300 languages are spoken, there’s an immigrant population of 3 million already, and our economy needs you, despite what some are saying of late. If you want to be able to see the stars at night and breathe clean air, then no (this is something I have been considering recently, on both an existential and a lung-based level), because London has some of the worst pollution in the UK. If you are a money launderer, hun, you don’t even have to live in London, the city welcomes you with open arms. If you like friendliness in strangers … still live in London, because I don’t agree (and I’m a northerner), with the trope of it being an unfriendly place. Should you live in London if you are homeless and have lived in the city for years and your entire support network is based here, yet your council is trying to move to you to some faraway part of the country? Hell yes, you should live in London. Write to your MP. If you want a transport network that means five minutes for the next train is deemed an annoyingly lengthy wait, also yes. If you don’t enjoy quasi-jaunty pub signs that crush the soul, then no. Or, yes, but know that you shall have to endure them.

Our league table shows that retailers are offering their customers clear labelling and the chance to make a difference, helping to protect fish stocks for our children and our grandchildren.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282647f69113c63149e251680c3776149569d957/0_15_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=630818205760759f2044c23a51cffd75 1240w","title":"costa coffee to recycle equivalent of all its takeaway cups each year","story":"UK’s largest coffee shop chain has pledged to recycle up to 500m cups a year by 2020 – a fifth of the total used in the country The UK’s largest coffee chain is to become the first to commit to recycling the same volume of takeaway cups used by its customers every year in a bid to stop hundreds of millions needlessly ending up in landfill.Costa Coffee has pledged to recycle up to 500m coffee cups a year by 2020 – the equivalent of its entire annual use of takeaway cups and one-fifth of the total 2.5bn takeaway coffee cups used in the UK each year.The chain of more than 2,000 UK stores has created a new model which it says will guarantee the recycling of cups by incentivising waste companies to collect them and send them to recycling plants, and could lead to 100m cups being recycled this year. Starbucks offers a 25p discount for customers who bring in a reusable mug or tumbler. Its own costs £1.The largest chain, Costa, will take 25p off for any reusable cup for hot and cold barista-served drinks (excluding stores in Northern Ireland and concessions stands in petrol stations). Its own reusable cups cost £3.Pret a Manger\u0026nbspdoubled its discount\u0026nbspto 50p on all hot drinks bought by customers with reusable cups, and it is planning to launch its own reusable cup later in the year.Bakery chain Paul has recently more than doubled its reusable cup discount – from 10p to 25p – for customers ordering any hot drink. Its own reusable mug costs £3.50.Greggs\u0026nbspwill refill any reusable cups and give those customers a 20p discount.​ Its own reusable cups cost £2.Disposable cups cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a tightly bonded polyethylene liner, which is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups are recycled.From Wednesday, Costa is to pay a supplement of £70 to the waste collectors for every tonne of cups collected, to make it more financially attractive for them to collect, sort and transport coffee cups to recycling plants, meaning fewer cups will end up in landfill. The company says these extra costs will not be reflected in higher prices for consumers.Among potential solutions to the coffee cup problem, MPs on the environmental audit committee recently proposed a 25p “latte levy” on all hot drinks bought in takeaway containers. The coffee chain Starbucks is currently trialling the impact of a 5p levy in a three-month pilot, while Waitrose has announced plans to remove all disposable coffee cups from its shops by this autumn. Costa offers a 25p discount to customers who bring in a reusable cup, while Pret A Manger offers a 50p reduction.Trewin Restorick of the environmental charity Hubbub said of Costa’s move: “It’s great to see industry stepping up the pace to tackle this serious environmental issue. There has been a significant increase in the UK’s recycling facilities over recent months and the biggest challenge now is to make sure the used cups are collected and make it to the recycling plants.”Costa’s announcement is in partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile. The move means that the three UK paper mills –James Cropper, ACE UK and DS Smith – that can recycle cups containing polyethylene plastic can potentially boost their recycling from 14m cups to 100m this year.“It dispels the myth that coffee cups can’t be recycled,” said Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa. “By creating a market for cups as a valuable recyclable material, we are confident that we can transform the UK’s ineffective and inconsistent ‘binfrastructure’ to ensure hundreds of millions of cups get recycled every year. 100m cups will be recycled this year alone following our announcement, and if the nation’s other coffee chains sign up, there is no reason why all takeaway cups could not be recycled by as early as 2020.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brighton tottenham premier league match report","story":"It was on this day last year that Brighton ensured their promotion from the Championship. On Tuesday night at the Amex Stadium they took a small step towards retaining their Premier League status for another season.The fiendish nature of their run-in has been well-documented and Chris Hughton’s team must still face the Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Burnley in their final matches. They needed something, anything, to allow them to breathe a little easily after a worrying run of one point from an available 15. This was it.The horror of Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at Crystal Palace was forgotten as Brighton put their bodies on the line to earn precious reward. The roar from the home crowd at the full-time whistle told its own story. Brighton are eight points clear of third-from-bottom Southampton, although they have played a game more.Tottenham have a bigger match round the corner in the shape of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United and Mauricio Pochettino appeared to have one eye on it with his team selection. He made six changes from Saturday’s home defeat by Manchester City and omitted Davinson Sánchez and Dele Alli from the squad entirely. He gave Toby Alderweireld his first Premier League action since 28 October and the centre-half was not overly extended.However, Pochettino made the point yet again that the league was the priority. The personnel changes, he said, were purely down to fatigue from the City game. “If we win the FA Cup, we are not going to play Champions League,” Pochettino said. “You only do that if you finish in the top four. Today was the most important game.”For Tottenham it felt like points dropped. Pochettino was entitled to say that his team had “dominated” the game in terms of possession and territory but he was also on the money when he lamented a “lack of aggression” in the final third. They were unable to create sufficient clear-cut chances.Harry Kane put Spurs in front with his 26th goal of the Premier League season – his Golden Boot rival, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, has 30 – but Brighton showed their strength of character with an instant riposte through Pascal Gross’s penalty. Hughton had given him the responsibility after a couple of penalty misses this season by Glenn Murray.Tottenham’s lead over fifth-placed Chelsea could be cut to five points with four matches to play when their London rivals go to Burnley on Thursday. But theirs remains a position of strength. Three of their final four matches are at Wembley – against Watford, Newcastle and Leicester – and the other one is a trip to West Brom.Pochettino’s team sought to impose their pressing game and they sparked danger on a number of occasions when they forced errors from Brighton high up the pitch. Gross was guilty of the stray pass that set in motion the move for Kane’s goal at the beginning of the second half.He put Gaëtan Bong in trouble, the left-back was tackled by Victor Wanyama and, when the ball broke, Son Heung-min tried to run round Lewis Dunk on the byline. Son did not look to have the room but he benefited from the spin of the ball, which remained on the right side of the line, and the alarm bells sounded when Kane swooped. He crashed home from close range.Brighton’s response was impressive. José Izquierdo got away from Serge Aurier inside the box following Murray’s touch and the Tottenham right-back’s attempt to rectify the situation was clumsy. Izquierdo felt the contact and went down. Gross’s penalty was too powerful for Hugo Lloris.The first half had been end-to-end without too many thrills in front of goal. Son, who menaced Bruno, the Brighton right-back and captain, had the clearest chance in the third minute of stoppage-time. Taking a flick from Kane, he eked out a yard of space before shooting for the bottom corner. Mathew Ryan thrust out a hand to save smartly.Set pieces had seemed the likeliest route to the breakthrough. The tension inside the ground was palpable when Christian Eriksen and Kane stood over free-kicks on the edge of the Brighton area on 11 and 44 minutes respectively, but neither could convert. The awards had followed loose passes from Beram Kayal and Anthony Knockaert.At the other end Dunk rose to direct a towering header at goal from Gross’s 19th minute corner and Anthony Knockaert almost applied the decisive touch in front of Lloris. Knockaert was a willing and pacy outlet and he worked Lloris with a deflected shot while Murray could not muster sufficient power in his flick after slick work from Gross. Ryan also had to be alert to tip over a long ranger from Lucas Moura.Tottenham pushed for the winner in the second half, with Pochettino introducing Mousa Dembélé and Erik Lamela, but Brighton’s resolve was fierce. Their support endured a few flutters, not least when Eriksen fizzed in a cross-cum-shot and Shane Duffy erted the ball inches past the far post, while Lamela was denied by Ryan. Hughton’s battlers had done enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ada9c14ec3c5bfea15031763c1d0af9949ede1/0_63_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=22fdeebef7abe6b9e94af03b891a2913 1240w","title":"wolves link jorge mendes agent premier league scrutiny","story":"• Portuguese’s Molineux relationship will have to pass top-flight test• FA and EFL fail to explain how arrangement complies with rulesWolves will have to satisfy the Premier League that their relationship with Jorge Mendes does not break league or FA rules, following a promotion secured with a manager and key players connected to the super agent.The club’s ownership structure and details of Mendes’s influence must be fully disclosed during the regulatory process, which will begin shortly, of accepting Wolves into the top flight.The FA rules on clubs’ relationships with agents, now called “intermediaries”, aimed at guarding against conflicts of interest, prohibit owners also owning a stake or having an interest in an agency. Similarly agents are prohibited from having “a material influence” over the affairs of a club.Last summer Wolves confirmed that the club’s owner since July 2016, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, does own a stake in Mendes’s company, Gestifute. “Fosun have a percentage stake in the Gestifute company headed up by Jorge Mendes,” the club said.Having acquired the stake in Mendes’s agency in January 2016, the Chinese owner “canvassed advice” from Mendes before buying Wolves six months later, the club’s managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said on Sky TV this week. Since the takeover Mendes has been involved in recruitment as the manager of his longstanding client Nuno Espírito Santo and Portuguese players who have transformed the quality of the Wolves squad.Public disclosures have stated the stake is owned by Shanghai Foyo, a company majority owned by the Fosun chairman, Guo Guangchang. Gestifute and Shanghai Foyo have since January 2016 been involved in a joint agency and marketing venture in Chinese football the launch in Shanghai was attended by Mendes and officials from Benfica and Monaco, where Mendes has been highly influential.The EFL has said it believes the rules have been complied with after Wolves gave undertakings and put “appropriate arrangements in place” following Fosun’s takeover from Steve Morgan in July 2016.Wolves are compiling a further written explanation of Mendes’s position for the EFL, following complaints last month by the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani. He tweeted during Leeds’ 3-0 defeat by Wolves: “Not legal and fair to let one team owned by a fund who has shares in the biggest players’ agency with evident benefits (top European clubs giving players with options to buy) … why the other 23 teams can’t have the same treatment?”Radrizzani followed that with a letter to the FA, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes. He told the BBC that when he was preparing to buy Leeds last year, he sold his shares in an agency, on advice from his lawyer: “I did because obviously there is a conflict of interest and I always pay attention to staying within the rules.”Dalrymple confirmed this week that Mendes “has advised us on players we have taken but equally he has advised us on players we have not continued to take” and that: “There are some players that are connected with him who have come in and done a really good job for us.”Despite that acknowledgment, and widespread reporting that the standout signing from Porto, Rúben Neves, and other Portuguese recruits, are Mendes clients, neither Mendes nor Gestifute is declared as any of the players’ agents on the FA’s record of Wolves’ signings published this month.Neves signed for Wolves for £15.8m in the summer his agent, recorded in the FA’s document based on filings by Wolves, was another Portuguese intermediary, Jorge Pires Serralheiro. The same agent acted for other young Portuguese players signed by Wolves who are commonly cited as Mendes clients: Pedro Gonçalves, Rúben Vinagre and Boubacar Hanne. The midfielder Diogo Jota, 21, who has excelled on loan from Atlético Madrid, was represented by a Spanish agent, Carlos Bucero Gómez, according to the FA’s document.Gestifute appears only once as an agent in the signings Wolves are recorded to have made last summer: another Gestifute director, Andy Quinn, an accountant based in Dublin, is stated to have acted for Wolves when Jota was signed.Those signings followed the acquisitions the previous year of other Portuguese players, including Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro and João Teixeira, who were represented by a lawyer, Carlos Osório de Castro, or an agent, Valdir Cardoso, understood to do work for Gestifute.A Wolves spokesman said neither Serralheiro nor Bucero was associated with Mendes or Gestifute. The club has consistently played down Mendes’s influence. Dalrymple, despite confirming the signing of players “connected” to Mendes, described him again this week as an adviser and close friend to the chairman, Jeff Shi, who “can use him as a sounding board”.Wolves are “still completely comfortable with their position,” Dalrymple said, and will provide the same information to the Premier League as they have given to the EFL and FA.“We don’t believe, and I don’t believe the authorities believe, that we’ve stepped outside the rules,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86390fa2d20a3ca7d122e937ae760358800fd533/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e9bbff51bb9013245bef5b5c622f0c2 1240w","title":"accrington stanley promotion league one","story":"Accrington, the small Lancashire town with a Football League tradition dating back 130 years, is celebrating as never before. Its team, for so long synonymous with underdog ignominy, have secured a first league promotion, more than 50 years after going bust and tumbling into oblivion. Their ascent to League One is the latest ste​p​ in the extraordinary revival of Accrington Stanley, the self-styled “club that wouldn’t die”.Stanley first joined the league in 1921, following in the footsteps of Accrington FC, an inaugural Football League member who lasted for only six years. Their successor survived for longer but found things no easier. Trapped between Burnley and Blackburn, and circled by even bigger fish in Merseyside and Manchester, Stanley faced a constant battle to stay afloat.The club’s only respite from the bottom tier came in 1958, when they were drafted into the new national Division Three. Four years later financial problems forced them out of the league and by 1966 the club had folded. Stanley disappeared for two years before being reborn in the back room of a pub and settling into non-league anonymity.Their name became best known for a mocking reference in a milk advert. “Accrington Stanley, who are they?” may still have its own Wikipedia page but the team that the club president, Peter Marsden, called “the most famous minnows in the world” have now returned emphatically to the map.The stewardship of the long-time manager, John Coleman, and the owner, Andy Holt, who took over in 2015, has allowed the perennial strugglers to broaden their ambitions.The windfall helped Accrington climb into the Conference and secure full-time status, laying the foundations for an unexpected league return in 2006. Their new status brought back old financial concerns, with Coleman conjuring a late run of wins to keep them up in their first season, and the threat of a second bankruptcy was never far away.The team owe their league return and subsequent survival to a string of benefactors with roots in the town, from Whalley and Marsden to the banker Ilyas Khan and former Lancashire and England cricketer David Lloyd, enamoured of his hometown club’s will to “fart against thunder”. Marsden also wanted to turn Stanley’s hard luck story into a motivating source of pride. When he reappointed Coleman and his assistant, Jimmy Bell, in 2014 after a two-year absence, he urged the club to put aside their “misplaced sense of inferiority”.Holt’s investment has bolstered this new self-belief and the owner has become a prominent cheerleader. Last year he pointed out that the club’s £2.2m turnover was less than every current top-flight club spent on agent fees in a single year – in short, Stanley are “a starving peasant begging for scraps” from the Premier League table.The club’s main men have also endured run-ins with the Football League. Coleman spoke out after Carlisle were allowed to move home games in the wake of flooding in 2015, an option he claimed was not available to Accrington. This season Holt’s revelation that he gives the team £200 to spend in McDonald’s after wins has led to ill-advised EFL intervention. The league has since tried to bury the hatchet, presenting Holt with a burger at its annual awards ceremony days before promotion was confirmed.The forward Billy Kee, named in the EFL’s team of the season at last week’s ceremony, truly embodies the Accrington way. Released by Leicester City at the age of 20, Kee was nurtured by Coleman at a time when he wanted to walk away from football. The manager has not forced a nutritional regime on his target man and gave the striker time off to deal with anxiety and depression. He has repaid his manager with more than 50 league goals, including the double that secured promotion against Yeovil on Tuesday.On and off the field Stanley have reaped the benefits of doing things differently. After home wins at the Crown Ground, £1 pints of beer are served up to supporters, and Coleman has built a team worthy of promotion at an equally modest price. Promotion to the third tier for a team once best remembered as a punchline is an incredible achievement but not a shock based on recent results. Stanley missed out by the width of a post in 2016 and have lost once since Boxing Day.Kee, Coleman and even Holt, who has thrown himself into the realities of lower-league football, may need time to adjust to their new surroundings. They will play teams whose grounds could hold most of the town’s 35,000 population, but it would be a mistake to write them off. Theirs is a club that has survived and\u0026nbsp thrived by doing things on their own terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01da0764b7b7bd2b010899467c0f3e4e5253db62/0_133_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c15dd41835bbe990f603b031fb33bf6b 1240w","title":"which football teams have missed two penalties in added time","story":"Plus: an XI from the same foreign country, teams not switching ends and more. Mail us your answers or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“In Cardiff v Wolves recently, Cardiff were awarded and missed two penalties in second-half injury time. Surely this madness has never happened before,” wonders Ben Jones.Tim Hanson has news for Ben: “In April 2010, AFC Wimbledon’s 19-year-old goalkeeper Seb Brown saved penalties from Mansfield’s Jake Speight and Kyle Perry to hand the Dons a 1-0 win. Seb was a boyhood Wimbledon fan and had been brought into the team in place of regular keeper James Pullen. Brown was to repeat the two-penalty-saves feat two years later, keeping out two Luton players as Wimbledon won a Football League place via a penalty shootout.”“This also happened in the Cambridge United v Accrington Stanley game last season,” reports Adam Clark, who notes: “Incidentally, Will Norris, the heroic Cambridge United keeper at the time, is now reserve keeper at Wolves, and was on the bench at Cardiff last Friday.”Joe Groszewski writes in to add that: “In 2006, Blackburn missed two last-minute penalties as we fell victim to Big Sam’s Bolton. Benni McCarthy feebly hit the first straight at Jussi Jaaskelainen but someone was fouled during the follow-up. Then Jason Roberts sidefooted the second to exactly the same place.” Ross Flockhart clarified that the penalties were in the last five minutes and not actually injury-time, but reckons the referee will be familiar …“In AEK Larnaca’s 3-2 to defeat to AEL Limassol in the Cypriot league last week they started with nine Spaniards. Is this a record for a team fielding foreign players one from country?” asks Will Unwin.Stephan Wijnen has the answer (as do Flor van der Eycken , Dirk Mass and Tys Hallema, who also emailed in) and it is: “No. In May 2004, Beveren fielded 10 players from Ivory Coast during the Belgian cup final against Club Brugge (Igor Stepanovs from Latvia, on loan from Arsenal, was the exception). This was the starting line-up: Copa, Eboué, Stepanovs, Kanté, Boka, Djire, Lolo, Mandaka, Né, Romaric, Sanogo. Moreover, two of the three substitutions that Beveren brought on were also from Ivory Coast.”Boris Cule adds: “Beveren finally went one better on the opening day of the next season, when their entire starting lineup came from Ivory Coast.”Lewis Fairfax has another: “Calcio San Marino (the only team in the principality) regularly field lineups composed solely of players eligible to play for Italy rather than San Marino. They play in the Girone (Group) F of the Italian Serie D, and an example was their match against Sammaurese Calcio on 4 December 2016: Dini (born in Cattolica, Italy), Fagioli (Cesena, Italy), Bova (Caserta, Italy), Fantini (Cesena, Italy), Zamagni (Cesena, Italy), Mazzotti (Cesena, Italy), Cenci (Rimini, Italy), Baldazzi (Castel San Pietro, Italy), Buonocunto (Naples, Italy), Guidi (undisclosed, Italy), Braccini (San Piero in Bagno, Italy).”“Has there ever been a professional match where the teams did not change ends at half-time?” wonders Lewis Jones. “If so, what was the reason?” Ian Williams writes: “Yes and no. Shortly after the start of the second half of the Italian Serie B match between Foggia and Bari in 1999, rival fans started to throw missiles at the opposing goalkeepers. In order to complete the match, referee Pierluigi Collina asked both teams if they would be happy to continue the match at the end from which they had played in the first half. With the goalkeepers distanced from opposition fans, the match was completed without incident. The second half was not restarted just ends were changed.”“Has a goalkeeper ever been sent off during a penalty shootout?” wondered Olumide Hassan in 2005.Hats off to Tommy Tucker for discovering that Botswana goalkeeper and captain Modiri Marumo was sent off during a Castle Cup shootout against Malawi in May 2003. Having been booked for time-wasting before Malawi scored their third spot-kick, Marumo “reacted to a pat on the shoulder from opposite number Philip Nyasulu by punching him in the face and got a red card”. Malawi went on to win 4-1 and reach the semi-finals. “I over-reacted,” admitted Marumo. “This unbecoming behaviour has not only embarrassed me, but also the organisation that I work for.”“On 21 April, it’s possible that, at the Sunderland v Burton Albion match, both sides could kick off with a mathematical chance of survival but, by full-time, could each be relegated. Have there ever been any examples of two un-relegated teams playing each other and both going down at full-time?” poses Mark Stephenson.“During Milan v Napoli last weekend, I noticed Gigi Donnarumma and Arkadiusz Milik both wear No 99. Is this the first time this has happened?” asks Kevin Davey.“Chester have appointed 24-year-old Calum McIntyre as manager. Has any national level club in England ever appointed such a young manager? What about elsewhere?” queries Benjamin Young.“Chelmsford City striker Scott Fenwick recently scored two consecutive hat-tricks of penalties in the Vanarama Conference South (v Whitehawk and East Thurrock). Has this feat been matched or bettered?” enquires Ross Rogers.“Players owning pubs after retiring used to be a big thing in days gone by but who was the last high-profile player to follow this course on retiring?” muses Alistair Moffat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bfb3500adf59d247345c3e11d39ff9193dbbe51/0_154_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=720ffd530c5b42ce49e6b1763790c7fc 1240w","title":"commonwealth nations malaria summit london","story":"Leaders at health summit in London will be urged to adopt target of halving cases of the disease by 2023, to save 650,000 livesInvestments worth more than £2.7bn are being pledged on Wednesday in a drive to halve the number of malaria cases across the Commonwealth.Heads of state and business leaders are convening in London to galvanise the fight against the disease, which has seen a resurgence in some areas.For the first time in 10 years, malaria cases are no longer falling. Not only has progress stalled but in some countries the trend has reversed. Six out of 10 malaria cases globally occur in Commonwealth countries. The leaders of those nations will be urged to make a historic commitment to halve the number of malaria cases by 2023 – a goal that, if successful, would prevent 350 million cases and save 650,000 lives. The heads of 16 out of 53 Commonwealth countries attend a summit on Wednesday, hosted by the governments of Rwanda, Swaziland and the UK. Rwanda is one of the countries experiencing a rise in malaria cases.Pedro Alonso, director of the World Health Organization global malaria programme, warned that the fight against the disease is at a crossroads. “History has taught us well that when we lift our foot from the accelerator malaria comes back with a vengeance. We must take a decisive leap forward or we risk going backwards and we have seen that already happening in a number of countries,” he told the Guardian.Last year, a report by the WHO found that Rwanda and Nigeria saw more than 1 million new cases of malaria between 2015 and 2016. Twenty-four countries had an increase of more than 50,500 cases in 2016.Just five of the 29 high-burden countries, including Gambia and Madagascar, saw a significant decrease in malaria cases. “We are stalling and unless we do something urgently we are going to see this trend continue in the coming years,” said Alonso. Bill Gates, chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – which announced it will extend its investments in malaria by an additional £700m through to 2023 – said he hoped the summit would mark a turning point in tackling the disease.“The commitments being made today show the world is ready to beat malaria. It’s a disease that is preventable, treatable and ultimately beatable, but progress against malaria is not inevitable.”The summit will call for greater investment in new ways to combat the disease as the existing methods – nets, sprays and treatments – come under threat from drug and insecticide resistance.Pharma company GSK has pledged £175m in research and development on top of existing funding that includes work to implement the world’s first malaria vaccine, due to be piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi later this year. It is anticipated the company’s new interventions – delivered on a not-for-profit basis – will reach more than 3 million people worldwide.Meanwhile the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria will announce $2bn of funding from 46 countries affected by malaria between 2018 and 2020.The UK has already pledged £500m a year to tackling the disease until 2020-2021. Of that £100m will be used to fund-match contributions from private donors through the Global Fund. The prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We will support and incentivise others to invest in what is needed, from cutting edge research to ensuring access to malaria treatment and prevention for those most at risk.”Global funding for malaria has plateaued since 2010 and is disproportionately provided by donor countries rather than those with malaria risk.The Ghanian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said: “We are on a cliff edge. Either we step back and save millions more lives or we fall and see a deadly resurgence that could take half a century to recover from.“This is not a plea for more aid money from western donors. I have publicly committed myself to African leaders finding African solutions to African problems. It is right we take responsibility for our own destiny.”He assured: “Where greater domestic funding is needed we will find the money.”Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, said the reasons for a resurgence in some countries varied.“The east African countries have had a distinct challenge because of the El Niño phenomenon – they have had flooding every year now for several years. There has also been an increase across all countries in temperature attributed to climate change.” These conditions have led to an increase in mosquito populations, she said. “In Rwanda, they have massively increased their rice production, and rice paddy fields provide ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.”James Whiting, executive director at Malaria No More UK, said it would be a huge step forward if Commonwealth countries, where about half of all global malaria cases are found, were to meet the 2023 target.“Our hope is that this is the beginning of a tidal wave across the world of reigniting the malaria campaign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f676da3c33daa5ea13a5503b6c2cccf5bc364/0_547_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d52132ac0838201978989a0f677b89cb 1240w","title":"held back from promotion too honest","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

I am strongly attracted to a friend with whom I work. We meet up once a year and work together for several weeks across the summer. The rest of the year, I’m in another country.Last summer I told him I was attracted to him, and his reaction was initially one of joy and surprise. Moments later his attitude changed and he started to talk about his “issues”. Over the next few weeks, he distanced himself from me. We did have one good talk, during which he said he was worried about detrimental effects on his mental health if things didn’t work out. I get strong signals that he would be very interested, except for this fear holding him back.Since separating our work has required us to remain in email contact. Besides work emails, I have sent several personal emails in which I have told him in detail about how I feel about him and how much I value and admire him, in the hope that it will give him some reassurance. I’ve not had much response, other than a brief thank you in acknowledgement, to these.I am in a quandary about what to do when we meet up again this summer. I flip between thinking I will keep my distance and let it go, and thinking I will push things a little further. But I am very worried that pushing things further may constitute harassment.You say you get “strong signals that he would be very interested except for this fear holding him back”, but the signals that you’ve described here are, alas, not that. You told your friend that you were attracted to him in person and he told you that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with you. You told him again, over email, how you felt about him, and you’ve “not had much response”.I’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your friend wants to date you. Who knows why not? It may be the “issues” he professes. It may be something else altogether, but the bottom line is that it’s not your job to persuade him otherwise.That’s not to say I don’t understand your desire to encourage him to feel otherwise! You mentioned that his initial reaction to you confessing your feelings was joyful, and it’s natural to wish that you could help him get back to that feeling. But what I learned from my own experience with ambivalent men (and oh my, I have known quite a few ambivalent men) is that the key to a successful relationship is two people wanting to be in a relationship. You can be kind and you can be encouraging, but you can’t make someone want to be with you by persistence and force of will.Will trying again to persuade your friend constitute harassment? I think it could be viewed as unwanted behaviour. Imagine if the gender roles were reversed: in this post-#MeToo world, a man who asks a female colleague out repeatedly after she says no would be seen as a creep. Even if he did not make a formal complaint if you “push things a little further”, your continued pursuit after your friend gave you a pretty clear no may make him uncomfortable, and have a negative effect on your experience working together. That would be a shame, since you clearly care about your friend and your work.Please don’t lose heart, or at least not too much. That you’ve written to ask me this question and that you don’t want to step over the line shows that you are a thoughtful and caring person. I’m certain that you will meet someone who you adore who will adore you back without caveat or condition or hesitation: someone who, like you, is ready, not afraid. I teach English as a foreign language and I’ve always been a bit wary about relationships related to work – both with colleagues and students (adult students, obviously). Although I’m relaxed about being friends with adult students outside of the classroom, I’ve always personally carried the idea that dating students is something that shouldn’t happen.However, I’ve met other teachers who’ve ended up in great romantic relationships with students (often after they’ve stopped being their teacher) and who now have happy marriages. I’m curious to know what you and others think, especially as it could potentially be an issue for me in the future.You gut feeling is correct: you should not date your students, even if they are adult students. The student-teacher relationship is inherently imbalanced in favour of the teacher’s authority, even if the student pursues the teacher, rather than vice versa. (Jo Livingstone wrote very well about this in the New Republic.) Your no dating students rule is right because it respects the reason that your students are spending time with you: to learn. A classroom is not a singles bar. I would also say that if a teacher is standing in front of a classroom of adult ESL students and thinking about which one of them is most attractive, rather than how to help them learn English, the teacher is … not really doing their job?Drawing the line at dating students also eliminates risks: that your relationship with one student might have a negative impact on your other students, your ability to do your job or your employer’s perception of your motivation and performance. These are all things that you’ll put on the line if you date a student, even if the relationship itself is True Love.Once someone is no longer studying under you, I think you can feel free to ask them out – when they’re not your student, but your peer. But maybe wait until they’ve been out of your classroom for a few days before you make your move, lest this give your employers the impression that you’ve been counting the days until the end of term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffcb6ac076ffb304448ff2002ccc514ee36d052f/0_1420_3475_2085/master/3475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b17fd15d7ea47fe7365b66134176a80 1240w","title":"pierre koffmann recipe for salade nicoise with seared tuna","story":"Avoid the pitfalls of a bad niçoise with this recipe that tops the salad with tuna steakThe “authentic” ingredients of a salade niçoise are debatable – potato and tuna being the most contentious.

Are cinephiles – and conventional broadcasters – right to fear for the future?At the Berlin film festival last February, Clare Binns took her seat for the premiere of a Spanish film that was generating a quiet buzz. She hoped it might play at Picturehouse Cinemas, the British chain of cinemas she runs. In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar.“It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.”Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly isive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds.Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.”Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form.Last week, Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.”Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sarandos was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sarandos wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”.But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year.“He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.”Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”.The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home.In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says.For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.”iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says.Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes.Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes.“If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test” if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds.Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so.In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b366e2e9b3442cd6953687c11d976405cb01fbb5/78_7_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2f44b0da0a3c0e433741525396a2983 1240w","title":"snail ballet dancers slow pixel elizabeth saint jalmes cyril leclerc","story":"Raised to be sauteed in garlic butter but freed by French vegetarian art anarchists, meet the unlikely stars of a mindful music performance Only minutes after meeting Elizabeth Saint-Jalmes and Cyril Leclerc at their Paris apartment, I’m invited into their darkened boudoir. Several snails are crawling on the floor next to the bed. Each has a little light-emitting diode attached to its shell that activates sensors on a nearby speaker designed by Elizabeth that is pumping out soothingly drone-like music composed by Cyril.What I’m witnessing is a teaser for a six-hour, 176-snail ballet called Slow Pixel that the two artists are bringing to London later this month for its UK premiere as part of Cryptic’s Sonica festival. For only £4.50, you can watch illuminated snails crawl around a darkened room to challenging music. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted.“These snails were raised to be eaten,” Elizabeth whispers. It’s striking how all three of us change our behaviour in this chambre des escargots – we speak more quietly, walk gingerly around the room (none of us want to hear the crunch of calcium carbonate shell) and find ourselves kneeling to get a closer view. We, as much as the snails, are performers in this ballet.Can you assure me, I whisper, that no gastropods were harmed in the making of this artwork? “Absolutely,” replies Elizabeth, thoughtfully placing one on my notebook, the better to illuminate my shorthand.She tells me that these eight snails, and the hundreds more she and Cyril keep in the cellar, are from the gastronomically prized species gros-gris (fat greys). “We are vegetarians and in a sense we have freed them from their destiny.” That destiny, most likely, was to be sauteed in garlic butter.Cyril produces a plant mister and sprays the snails with water. “They like humidity and showering them helps simulate that,” he says. Don’t the snails get stressed with diodes strapped to their shells? “Snails don’t get stressed,” he says. “Their heart rate is always 35 beats per minute. You know when they’re upset, though. They retreat into their shells.”Cyril, 43, and Elizabeth, 40, have been using snails in their art for eight years. Their first gastropod-based interventions involved feeding snails paper of different colours. Cyril recalls: “We would feed them red paper and they would shit red patterns. And if we fed them yellow and blue paper, what colour do you think they would shit?” Green? “Exactly.”The French couple’s art has an appealingly daffy, anti-commercial tenor. To clinch the point, Elizabeth takes a hunting horn from its case and blows a few notes so loud as to give any urban foxes in the 20th arrondissement the willies. Not to be outdone, Cyril starts strumming his tampura, an Indian stringed instrument often used to create droning, meditative effects. As I sit on the sofa drinking Japanese tea and snacking on cheese and nuts while they blow and strum, I wonder what the neighbours think.“We’re very much influenced by Fluxus,” says Elizabeth. That group of 60s artists, musicians, performers and even chefs often created art happenings involving chance, factors that provoked interactions between artist and audience. Elizabeth and Cyril’s work is neo-Fluxus, combining music, choreography and drawing, plus free-roaming snails.They hope to seduce visitors into a new relation with space and time. In a world where, as Parisian philosopher Paul Virilio has argued, technological change destroys space and compresses time, what a beguiling existential corrective it is to slow to a snail’s pace for a few hours. “Remember when you were a kid and you could sit and look at an insect for hours? Or watch a snail crawl across a path?” asks Elizabeth. Cyril hopes it will give visitors a Proustian rush, provoking bittersweet meditation on impermanence and lost time.During the performance, Elizabeth and Cyril place the light-bearing snails on the walls, creating effects that simulate the night sky or city lights. While the snails crawl up and down, the artists project video footage behind them shot from the window of the Trans-Siberian Express – as if to emphasise the difference between the human and gastropod pace of life. “What we both found amazing was how on the train, which actually only goes at about 80kmh, you can do nothing but eat, sleep and read – so your mind and body are in a different temporal relation to the world,” says Elizabeth. “That inspired much of what we’re thinking about with Slow Pixel.”Do many visitors stay for six hours? “It varies – some stay for just a few minutes,” says Elizabeth. “We insist only on one thing – people leave their phones outside.” They’ve both noticed how some visitors will try to smuggle their phones into the performance space, furtively taking selfies with snails.“It’s a shame when they do that, because we’re hoping to encourage mindfulness,” says Cyril. “Be in the moment, not always photographing it.” Such mindful art is a growing cultural tendency, embracing things from colouring books, to Rolf Hind’s opera Lost in Thought, to the TV shows that court viewers who want to get a real-time reindeer’s eye view of crossing the Arctic. “These can be immersive experiences for iniduals, liberating them from the everyday world,” says Elizabeth. “Just for a few hours.” Minutes later when I’m strap-hanging on the Métro, hurrying to catch the Eurostar home to meet a deadline, I realise these two French artists are right: us heedless humans have much to learn from the wisdom of snails.

Beginning his sold-out show, his dressed-down teen and young adult fans are transfixed by visuals portraying the him being late to his own show, before he confidently emerges from the rafters. On the day of his 20th birthday, the atmosphere is celebratory, and he is backed by an unexpected four-piece band that prove the night’s saving grace. They allow him to reach new musical depths, and his crystal-clear vocals – sharpened further when he delivers his song’s deft hooks – complete the package. Crooning through his set at a frantic pace, Not3s remains aloof throughout as crowd excitement and cameraphone videos churn below him.However, rarely does the show, even with cameos by fellow MCs Tinie Tempah, Shakka, Fredo and others, shift into second gear. Despite a playful demeanour and nice guy schtick, Not3s’ restrained crowd interaction and the plodding birthday acknowledgments (gifts of a Rolex from Tempah and platinum plaques from label bosses) by the show’s second act slow down proceedings a tad it’s his substitution for masked rapper SL, performing his hit Tropical and others, that gets the night’s biggest reaction. He initially drives through deeper cuts from 2017 EP Take Not3s and they keep the crowd’s attention, but the lack of rip-roaring moments means he continues to move at a pedestrian pace.But the show reaches a crescendo with his most recognisable hits: Addison Lee, My Lover and final song Aladdin, as well as exclusives from his forthcoming mixtape Take Not3s 2. Gaining newfound energy thanks to the addition of backup singers, Not3s bounces up and down the stage with purpose, finally coming close to matching the crowd’s enthusiasm in the midst of balloons and confetti. It’s an energy that was needed from the start, but luckily the band’s synergy, and the closing upsurge of rowdy riffs, piano thumps and hard drums turn an average set into a perfectly serviceable one by the end.

Almost none of the staff there knew anything about political campaigning. A lot of what I said to them and what I presented to them was novel. They had never heard of any of these tactics. They had never participated in politics before, and openly said: ‘I work for an insurance company, so: help.’”Kaiser said she and a Cambridge Analytica colleague gave advice on how to improve the survey methodology. “I was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single inidual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or Go Skippy.”She added: “They had probably already been doing that around a month or two.”The disclosure raises further questions about comments made by Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s former communications director, in which he described how the campaign used insurance actuaries to identify prime locations for political campaigning.Wigmore told the Guardian that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Kaiser also told the committee that Banks set up a company called Big Data Dolphins, which she said was working with a data science team at the University of Mississippi, after he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser questioned whether the data of British citizens “was sent abroad, specifically to Mississippi” for processing by Big Data Dolphins.Leave.EU attacked Kaiser’s evidence as “a confused litany of lies and allegations” and said that Eldon Insurance did not share data with anyone. “No data has been sent to Mississippi. The unit is still in the planning stage, it employs no one and is not operational,” the group said.An invoice of the same value was issued to Ukip, and Banks told the Observer that he had made a donation to the party to cover the cost of the bill. However, Ukip said it never paid Cambridge Analytica. It is unclear whether the invoice was ever settled.Kaiser also told the committee she had seen documents in which Nigel Oakes, the co-founder of the SCL Group, and the head of its defence ision, revealed the company’s audience-targeting methodology was for several years “export-controlled by the British government”.“That would mean that the methodology was considered a weapon,” she said. “Weapons-grade communications tactics – which means we had to tell the British government if that was going to be deployed in another country outside the United Kingdom.” She said the designation from the UK government was removed in 2015.Among the documents provided to the committee by Kaiser is a legal opinion drafted in support of a proposal for Ukip to share data with Cambridge Analytica.One of the authors of that opinion, Philip Coppel QC, last month represented Cambridge Analytica in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) from obtaining a warrant to raid the company’s premises.Kaiser’s testimony also threatens to raise further questions for Facebook after she said that far more people than previously understood may have had their data harvested from the site.Lawyers for Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended from his position last month, told the committee that he would not appear because he was a subject in an active ICO investigation.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e929a1bb0a90230afe46b51fe1064a265666ac3e/0_75_2216_1330/master/2216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a790c3dfbc097779b1384770dedeafb9 1240w","title":"brexit first talks on uks future relationship with eu begin","story":"Senior British and EU officials to meet across a table to discuss the future trade ties more than a year after article 50 was triggeredSenior British and EU officials will discuss the UK’s future relationship with the European Union for the first time on Wednesday, in a milestone for the Brexit talks.More than a year after the government triggered article 50, British and EU negotiators will meet across a table to discuss the UK’s future trade ties.The talks will be mostly limited to a formal presentation on the negotiating guidelines agreed by EU leaders in March, as well as setting a schedule for future meetings. Nonetheless, it is a significant moment for the UK, 10 months after the Brexit secretary, David Davis, was forced to bow to the EU’s timetable, having previously promised the “row of the summer”.Before Wednesday’s meeting, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, stepped up his call for guarantees to ensure that EU citizens can avoid the “bureaucratic nightmare” that has ensnared the Windrush generation.Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, Verhofstadt called on the chief Brexit negotiators, Davis and Michel Barnier, to be ready to make changes to the withdrawal treaty, if MEPs deemed modifications were needed.“Certainly after the Windrush scandal in Britain we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens and that there is no bureaucratic nightmare there,” he said.Home Office officials will be grilled by a special group of MEPs next Tuesday in Brussels, where they will be quizzed on the procedure for 3.5 million EU citizens to obtain special status. Following that meeting “if there are changes needed we will also communicate to the negotiators, to David Davis to Michel Barnier, what modifications are needed to avoid problems for EU citizens” Verhofstadt said.While the the European parliament is not negotiating Brexit, it has the power to veto the final deal and MEPs insist they are ready to use it.Wednesday’s talks are being led by Barnier’s deputy, Sabine Weyand, and the UK prime minister’s Europe envoy, Olly Robbins. Before talks on the future relationship, the pair are meeting to discuss progress on resolving the status of the Irish border, the most intractable issue of the talks.As that meeting was getting under way, Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, reiterated his warning that the UK risked leaving the EU without a deal if there was no solution on Ireland.“The UK’s decision on Brexit has caused the problem, and the UK will have to help solve it,” he told MEPs. “Without a solution, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition.”The Irish government, which is frustrated by slow progress, is pressing for a solution to the border question by June. So far Ireland has benefited from solid support from the rest of the EU, illustrated by a Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest European parliament group, who told MEPs on Wednesday: “We are all Irish in this regard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3416205e560e4a854745ce6d9549edfac5515bb/0_0_5419_3254/master/5419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=029a9031f19f9cfc3eb7debc8a075c35 1240w","title":"disabled people struggle to afford food and heating study says","story":"Charity says quarter of disabled adults have less than £50 a week left after tax and housing costsDisabled people are being forced to skip meals and sit in cold homes in a climate of benefit and social care cuts, according to new research.Analysis by ComRes on behalf of the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity shows almost a quarter of disabled adults aged 18-65 in the UK missed at least one meal in the last year, while a fifth said they were not able to keep their home warm.Leonard Cheshire said their latest research shows the impact has been “catastrophic” with essential heating, food or travel often becoming unaffordable.Neil Heslop, the CEO of Leonard Cheshire, said: “Our research lays bare the appalling situation many disabled iniduals and families find themselves in. Every day, thousands of people are teetering on the financial brink, unsupported and isolated. When high quality social care is provided, it has the power to transform lives. It can empower disabled people to live, learn and work as they choose.”“We expect disabled adults with care needs to receive high-quality support.

The site will house a health club and have conference facilities. The aim is to have it built before the start of the 2019-20 rugby and football seasons.Tuesday’s vote on funding was not overwhelming – 69-41 with eight abstentions – reflecting an issue that has ided opinion in the county. Those who opposed the plan questioned not only the significant investment of public money but whether the stadium would prove a drain on resources. “I am relieved and elated,” said Paul Durkin, the chairman of Cornish Pirates. “It has been a long haul but we got our message across that this was a stadium for Cornwall, not just the partners. Councillors have voted to make life better for the next generation and give them opportunities some people have not had so far.”The council was approached at the start of the year after the partners found themselves £6m short of the money needed to finance the stadium. A local MP, Derek Thomas, is meeting government officials on Wednesday to persuade them to honour Cameron’s promise. “We met with secretaries of state and ministers after David Cameron’s commitment, but we did not have a firm proposal then,” said Thomas. “We do now and I have been doing a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between MPs and various groups in relation to this. The council’s decision makes it much easier for us to make the case for government funding to make up the shortfall.”Bristol’s plan to rebrand the club to mark their return to the Premiership, meanwhile, led to them being them mocked on social media. As part of a bid to attract a global audience the team will be known as Bristol Bears. But fans who clicked on the Bristol Bears website after hearing the news were directed to a page run by a gay club in the city, the Bristol Bear, based in Old Market.“It’s hilarious,” said one member. “I have been checking out the rugby website and I am sure the players will be welcomed in Old Market.” Bristol said they were aware of the Bristol Bear club before the rebranding and anticipated a happy co-existence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec6ad21bde100b45bf8149dafcab2ca5106432/0_164_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14be4c2a7c178b598383e900595c61fa 1240w","title":"mo farah london marathon","story":"Mo Farah believes he can compete with the very best during Sunday’s London Marathon despite failing to deliver during his first attempt at 26.2\u0026nbspmiles in 2014.The 35-year-old dramatically hit the wall in London four years ago, gritting his teeth as early as the 17-mile marker before finishing eighth in a modest 2hr 8min 21sec.This time, however, Farah intends to stay with a stellar field, even if they start at world record pace, and says he is targeting Steve Jones’s 33-year-old British record of 2:07:13, as well as Sondre Nordstad Moen’s European best of 2:05:48.“This is the biggest race,” said Farah. “And there is only one way to run it – mixing with the guys and seeing what I can do. But it’s an amazing field. It’s got Eliud Kipchoge, who has run two hours, Kenenisa Bekele, who has run 2:03 and Daniel Wanjuri, who won last year.”Farah, who has spent the past three months in Ethiopia, says he feels revitalised and relaxed under his new coach, Gary Lough, and, surprisingly, believes he has the ability to run 2:03 – not far off the world record of 2:02:57 – once he has adapted to the uniquely punishing demands of the marathon.“I think I am capable of running 2:04 or 2:03 in the right race with the right pace,” he added. “But Sunday’s race is going to be different. There are many, many guys who are there to fight, so it’s going to be a difficult race.”When asked whether he would be prepared to go at world record pace on Sunday, despite the high temperatures forecast, he nodded. “If that is what the guys are doing, why not?”Certainly Farah appeared more relaxed than last year where barely a press conference went by without him having to fend off questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar, who is still under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Farah still faced them – insisting that he had not spoken directly to Salazar about running London or to the Nike Oregon Project coach David McHenry since last October – but no longer did he appear burdened by the association or the pressure of having to deliver gold medals over 5,000m and 10,000m.“On the track people expect you to win but now there are a lot of guys who can run a lot faster than me,” he said. “It’s a good feeling. I have found a new challenge and this is something I always wanted to do.”Farah explained that much of his confidence came from working with Lough, who had focused on his weaknesses and freshened up his training by running intervals with shorter rest periods. “There are things he has given me that I have not done before, so I am getting better at getting stronger,” said Farah. “Gary is a genius and I believe in him.”Organisers say they are monitoring the weather forecast – temperatures are projected to be 21C on Sunday – with the race director, Hugh Brasher, warning amateur runners they need to “listen to their body” and “change their plan” because of the heat.It is understood that extra water will be provided and over 1,000 medical staff will be on hand. But Farah insists he is not worried about running in the heat, despite seeing his fellow British athlete Callum Hawkins collapse during the final stages of the Commonwealth Games marathon.“I was obviously devastated seeing that,” said Farah. “Callum is a great fighter – he will go as hard as he can, and try and break the guys. But Sunday will be completely different. Hugh has told us there will be enough staff and doctors on hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6751c5fa3aff4fc155bb4c333e7b9b1277999839/242_86_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b5481d32916d2e7d3f5cd36841c27642 1240w","title":"talksport outbids bbc to secure rights for forthcoming england cricket tours","story":"TalkSport has announced a major coup late Tuesday after outbidding the BBC to secure the free-to-air radio broadcast rights for England’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies.It ends a 13-year association for the BBC, who last lost the rights to an oversees national team cricket tour in 2005, also on that occasion to TalkSport.Scott Taunton, chief exe of Wireless Group Limited, the parent company for TalkSport, was bullish in announcing the changes, as he spoke to Radio Today.“Winning these prestigious rights is a great victory for TalkSport and its first-class coverage.

Given that there has already been a bestselling memoir called I, Tina, a popular biopic starring Angela Bassett and even a jukebox musical, Soul Sister, the claim looks a little exaggerated. But this version, which comes with its subject’s blessing, offers a heady celebration of triumph over adversity and boasts a whirlwind performance by Adrienne Warren that left the audience, though not the star herself, breathless. The book by Katori Hall, assisted by Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, dwells on Tina Turner’s extraordinary tenacity and ability to overcome life’s obstacles. Born Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tennessee, and loving singing in Baptist choirs, she learns to cope with her parents’ separation. Teamed professionally with Ike Turner, whom she eventually marries, she has to endure the horrors of serial abuse. Divorced and striking out on her own, she initially pays a heavy financial price and, as a 40-year-old woman of colour, suffers rejection by a record industry dominated by white men. As the world knows, however, she went on to achieve solo stardom.While recording Tina’s troubles, the show is anything but a sob story since it is a tribute to her gutsiness and drive. I’d have liked to have heard more about how her Baptist upbringing and Buddhist conversion sustained her during the dark times, but Tina’s travails are always offset by the glories of the music. What is striking is the way the songs – and there are 23 of them – are used in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are there to advance the narrative, as when Tina steps into the breach in the recording studio and rescues a session by singing A Fool in Love. At other times, they demonstrate her capacity for reinvention: in River Deep, Mountain High she follows Phil Spector’s injunction to stick to the melody rather than relying on the kind of aggressive fervour encouraged by Ike. Only once did I sense a clunking cue for a song when Tina, talking to a sympathetic marketing man, superfluously enquires “what’s love got to do with it?” But the show rests on the shoulders of Warren, who is rarely off stage and who is simply astonishing. Above all, she captures the fact there is not one Tina Turner but several. Warren shows how Tina develops and changes as a singer and how, in moving to rock stardom, she retains her ferocious energy while introducing occasional notes of plangent melancholy. Warren also conveys Tina’s growth from stoical victim of Ike’s cruelty into a woman of defiant confidence. On top all that, she dances up a storm in a way that had the audience on its feet even before the curtain call. The tricky role is that of Ike, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith skilfully counters his monstrosity by suggesting that he never got his due as a pre-Elvis rock’n’roll pioneer and that he was a product of a culture that encouraged male swagger: you don’t like Ike but you begin to understand him. That, however, is the mark of a production by Phyllida Lloyd that is both intelligent and consistently good to look at. Mark Thompson’s design uses projections to create a whirling panorama of America, Bruno Poet’s lighting evokes the empurpled skies of Tennessee and the softer registers of a Monet-like Thames and, not least, there is the choreography of Anthony van Laast, which ensures the show is in perpetual motion. As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de03e30848280398bb5db0a62a717679b709f0b5/0_184_4356_2614/master/4356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f4d0464fe2fa8ca33b7cee30e84d40b 1240w","title":"us syria arab force replace american troops saudi arabia egypt uae","story":"Problematic proposal is backed by national security adviser John Bolton but could worsen conflictThe Trump administration is renewing an effort to replace US troops in Syria with an Arab force, but the proposal faces substantial obstacles and could potentially exacerbate the conflict.The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government was talking to Washington about raising such a force, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal that said the new US national security adviser, John Bolton, had called the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to ask Cairo to play a part in building one.There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria fighting Islamic State, but Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw them.The idea of an Arab coalition force playing a role in Syria to combat extremist groups and contain Iranian influence has surfaced several times since 2015, but faces severe problems. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are bogged down in a brutal war in Yemen, and have little manpower and few military resources to spare. They are also locked in a dispute with Qatar, another potential contributor to a force, while Egypt is much closer to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria than its would-be Gulf partners. Middle East experts said it was feasible Arab states could fund an army run by private contractors and possibly help recruit soldiers from developing countries such as Sudan. Erik Prince, a Trump ally who founded the military contractor Blackwater USA and now advises the UAE, is lobbying to play a role, according to the Wall Street Journal. A similar offer he made last year to replace US troops with private contractors in Afghanistan was turned down by the Pentagon.But Prince may have more traction in the White House over Syria. Bolton has argued that the US has borne too much of the military burden in Syria and Arab states should supply troops and material assistance in the fight against Isis.Meanwhile, the Saudi monarchy and its regional allies are uneasy that events on the ground in Syria are being dictated by external powers, none of which are Arab. Emile Hokayem, the senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The idea of an Arab expeditionary force emerges every couple of years, and it’s always seen as a politically brilliant idea to create a sense of ownership in the region.“In reality, the politics of putting a force like that together are almost impossible.“The question is: have the Saudis consulted the other countries before speaking on their behalf? The Saudis thought Egypt and Pakistan would come to help Yemen and they didn’t.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an Islamic military counter-terrorism coalition, which held its first high-level meeting last year, but it has not appeared to be intended for combat.Charles Lister, the director of the extremism and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute (MEI), attended the inaugural conference and said the force was intended for training and assistance programmes, rather than combat operations.Lister said there was “no precedent” for an Arab expeditionary force in Syria. Any Saudi troops deployed to Syria would find themselves directly confronting Iranian fighters and their allies, which could prompt a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Randa Slim, who directs the back-channel Track II diplomacy programme at MEI said: “It is one thing for the Saudis to pay for other ‘Islamic forces’ to do the job, and a totally different thing to send their men to a conflict theatre where they are bound to enter into direct confrontation with an entrenched Iranian-Hezbollah force.“The other factor to consider is: what is Turkey’s response to this proposal? I do not see Ankara welcoming the positions of Egyptian andor Emirati forces on its border,” Slim said. The Obama administration also looked at the possibility of Arab allies deploying counter-terrorist forces against Isis in Syria, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE were drawn into the battle for Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said: “They preferred to send intelligence officers and money, rather than put troops on the ground.“But for the Saudis, the trouble is their territory is being breached by Houthis every day. It doesn’t make sense for them to shift their ground forces when they have trouble securing their own border.”Heras said it was more likely Saudi Arabia would seek to outsource recruitment to countries such as Pakistan and Sudan. “I’m sure the Saudis are up for fighting in Syria to the very last Sudanese soldier,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f98d0a0345c851d4001f99c8b22212cc14c37be/0_172_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7be40efdd4c395c4ef76d361f2a0397e 1240w","title":"china defiant after new us security regulations target telecoms firms","story":"State media calls for Chinese citizens to stand up for phone makers ZTE and Huawei as backlash growsNew US regulations affecting Chinese technology companies have raised the stakes of an ongoing trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.After banning US companies from selling parts, software or services to mobile phone maker ZTE, US regulators said on Tuesday they would also bar government programs from buying from any company deemed a security threat. The measure is likely to affect ZTE as well as the Chinese smartphone maker, Huawei, two of China’s largest telecommunication companies.China responded on Wednesday that it has contingency plans for dealing with trade frictions. Yan Pengcheng, spokesman for the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s economic planning agency, said at a news conference that any impact on the Chinese economy from a trade dispute would be limited and manageable.The latest moves by the US open another chapter in rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. US President Donald Trump has threatened punitive tariffs on $150bn of annual Chinese imports, while China has threatened retaliatory tariffs on US exports such as soybeans, vehicles and aircraft. Both sides have signalled some willingness to negotiate. In a speech earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to further open up the Chinese economy, protect intellectual property and loosen restrictions on foreign investors in manufacturing sectors such as the auto industry. China, home to the world’s largest auto market, requires foreign carmakers to partner with local manufacturers and share ownership. The NDRC this week released a plan to phase out those rules by 2022 and to scrap them entirely for electric vehicle companies by the end of this year.Still, US regulations on Chinese technology companies could add to a growing backlash in China. Messages on social media have called for consumers to boycott popular US establishments popular such as McDonald’s, KFC and Apple.The editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, known for its nationalist editorials, called on Chinese citizens to stand up for its technology companies. “Tonight, me and the staff at Global Times are all ZTE,” he said on Weibo in a widely shared post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21105e64d6c7203ac01392bf279a29ee38731c9c/0_10_3328_1997/master/3328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=37bc91faf8789092ebf56e2906cc7ff7 1240w","title":"italian officials and german firm face legal action over saudi arms sales","story":"Human rights groups file complaint challenging arms exports used in Yemen bombingA rare legal action has been launched against Italian government officials and a major European arms manufacturer over alleged involvement in the aerial bombardment of Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians.A coalition of human rights organisations from Germany, Italy and Yemen filed a complaint on Tuesday with the prosecutors’ office in Rome against officials from the Italian foreign ministry and the local subsidiary of the German conglomerate Rheinmetall, RWM Italia, over arms sales to Saudi Arabia.The move was announced at a joint press conference of the organisations in Rome on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition conducting a bombing campaign of Yemen, aided by UK military advisers, against Houthi rebels.Recent challenges to the Saudi bombing campaign by human rights and anti-arms organisations in the UK and elsewhere in Europe have failed because they have tended to be too broad.The groups mounting the legal challenge in Italy hope that by focussing on a specific incident – a well-documented bombing on 8 October 2016 that left a family of six dead, including four children – they will increase their chances of success.The legal challenge was lodged jointly by the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the Yemen-based Mwatana Organisation for Human Rights and the Italian Rete Italiana per il Disarmo.The groups have asked prosecutors to investigate whether there is liability on the part of Italian foreign ministry officials tasked with authorising arms exports and RWM Italia directors over alleged arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition.Attempts by the Guardian to contact Rheinmetall for a response proved unsuccessful.Among the remnants that Mwatana said it found at the site of the 2016 attack on the village of Deir al-Jari in Hudaydah, north-west Yemen, was a suspension lug for holding bombs in place. According to the complaint, the serial number on the lug identified it as part of a batch manufactured in June 2014 by RWM Italia, which has its headquarters in Ghedi in northern Italy, and production facilities in Sardinia. Mwatana, which said it had arrived at the site of the bombing the day after the incident to interview witnesses and gather evidence, sent pictures to the Italian news agency Ansa last year. Linde Bryk, a Dutch lawyer who worked in Kosovo and is now with the ECCHR, said: “What makes this case special are the remnants found at the site of the airstrike. This case is emblematic as it not only concerns Italy’s role but the general question on the responsibility of European governments and European arms manufacturers for the consequences of arms exports used by the Saudi-led coalition.”She added that the case aimed to address the fact that merely having government export authorisation for arms sales does not shield these companies from liability.Politicians and military personnel enjoy a high degree of protection against prosecution, but those who filed the case are hoping a precedent can be set in which officials who authorise exports as well as arms manufacturers are not exempted. 2011 An Arab Spring-inspired uprising forces Yemen’s authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to agree to leave office.2012 Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, previously Saleh’s deputy, takes over as president following an election. He was the only candidate. He struggles to unite the country’s ided political landscape, cope with food insecurity and al-Qaida threats.2014 Houthi rebels (who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam) make advances and begin capturing the north of the country, an area they have historically controlled. In September they enter the capital, Sana’a. Hadi flees to Aden.2015 A renewed rebel offensive forces Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia, which views the Houthis as an Iranian proxy force. It begins bombing what it says are “military targets” associated with the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi’s predecessor, Saleh. The Saudi air campaign receives backing from a coalition of Sunni Arab states, as well as logistical support from the US, UK and France.October 2016 An airstrike by the Saudi coalition hits a funeral in Sana’a, killing 140. The UN announces a 72-hour ceasefire, which is allegedly broken by both sides.2017 Devastated by two years of fighting, Yemen is described by the UN as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Millions facing famine and the threat of cholera.\u0026nbspNovember 2017 Saudi Arabia imposes a blockade on Yemen’s ports, following the firing of a missile at Riyadh from rebel-held territory in Yemen. Medicines, vaccines and food are prevented from entering the country. The heads of the World Food Programme, Unicef and the World Health Organisation warn “untold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die”.Francesco Vignarca from Rete Disarmo said: “Despite the reported violations in Yemen, Italy continues to export arms to members of the Saudi-led military coalition. This is contrary to Italian law 1851990, which prohibits arms exports ‘to countries engaged in armed conflict’. Further, it is in contrast with the binding provisions of the EU common position on arms export control and the international arms trade treaty.”Civil war broke out in Yemen after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ejected the UN-recognised government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital, Sana’a, in 2015, prompting the Saudi-led intervention. The country has since endured what has been called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with three-quarters of the population of about 22 million people in need of some form of aid, according to the UN.If the Italian prosecutors’ office declines to pursue the case, the groups can consider going to higher courts, including the international criminal court, which so far has not been investigating events in Yemen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd673b1b51c09e2540fe115527a06191bd63bea3/0_27_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75fa8643351789ab5c1f2d04c5fb0ea2 1240w","title":"raul castro cuba step down leader miguel diaz canel","story":"Cubans greet end of the Castro era with indifference, not hope, as current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel is expected to replace RaúlWhen Cuba’s president stands down this week, it will mark the first time in nearly six decades that the island will be led by somebody whose last name is not Castro.The Cuban national assembly meets this Wednesday to elect the next president, and Raúl Castro is widely expected to be replaced by the current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel.The handover will mark the end of an era: Cuba without the Castros has been the holy grail for Florida-based Cuban exiles – and a policy vigorously pursued by a dozen successive US presidents. But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a newpresident were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised in an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4907b98745ce24b6f5dfcc25bf8e5c3f102283e/0_0_4579_2747/master/4579.jpg?w=4500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=191fd731510b971bdb2f4e9d5b269ded 9000w","title":"wednesday briefing brexit coming at too high a price","story":"Theresa May faces test in parliament as thinktank reveals cost of leaving … Barbara Bush dies aged 92 … and Cuba heads into post-Castro eraTheresa May faces test in parliament as thinktank reveals cost of leaving … Barbara Bush dies aged 92 … and Cuba heads into post-Castro eraHello – Warren Murray bringing you the news in the middle of the week.Each of the government’s four Brexit scenarios would leave Britain poorer and cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds per week, analysis by a thinktank has found.The study for Global Future is based on the government’s own Brexit impact studies, as well as other official sources. It forecasts that Theresa May’s preferred “bespoke” deal with the EU would leave Britain £40bn worse off per year, or £615m per week. Polling commissioned for the study by Populus found that even voters who backed Brexit at the referendum now fear that leaving the European Union comes at “too high a price”.Today, Theresa May is facing a potential stymie to her plans, bespoke or otherwise, as an amendment to let parliament vote on a continued customs union with the EU comes before the House of Lords. Nine senior Conservatives, including two former cabinet ministers, are among those who have put their names to a series of cross-party amendments aimed at persuading the PM to rethink her position.Barbara Bush dies – She was the wife of one president and mother of a second. Barbara Bush has died aged 92. The staunch Republican matriarch had heart problems and, following several recent hospitalisations, she opted to receive only “comfort care”, according to a family spokesman. Barbara Bush was married to George HW Bush, who became president in 1989, and their children included George W Bush, who was declared winner of the 2000 election in highly controversial circumstances. In 2013, when a presidential run by her son Jeb was mooted, she famously said that the country had had “enough Bushes”.‘A machine against one person’ – The Guardian has joined 18 news organisations from 15 countries to launch the Daphne project, continuing the anti-corruption investigations being carried out by Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia when she was murdered with a car bomb. Caruana Galizia challenged many who hold power and influence in Malta: mobsters, business people, public officials, lawyers, the governing Labour party and the current leader of the opposition Nationalists.“They found it difficult to attack what she said, so instead they attacked her on a personal level,” says her widowed husband, Peter, who now lives under police protection. As the investigations continue, we will share revelations from a cache of 680,000 files leaked to Caruana Galizia in the final months of her life.Quick catch-up – Here is what’s fresh in the week’s developing stories.\u0026gt Overnight, South Korea has confirmed it is seeking a peace treaty to officially end the war with the North.

A former Home Office employee said the cards had been a vital tool over the years to confirm the residency rights of Caribbean-born British citizens.\u0026gt Medics in Douma say they have been intimidated by the Syrian regime as it seeks to conceal the evidence of a chemical weapons attack. International inspectors are due to visit Douma today but Russia is being accused of delaying tactics. Patrick Wintour explains why Syria still possesses these weapons after it was supposed to have given them up.\u0026gt Labour MPs have rounded on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership in a Commons debate on antisemitism. “Antisemitism is making me an outsider in my Labour party. Enough is enough,” said Dame Margaret Hodge. Other Labour backbenchers were cheered and applauded as they made impassioned speeches.‘This is my new face’ – A French man has become the first patient in the world to have a face transplant twice. Jérôme Hamon needed the first procedure in 2010 because of a genetic disease. But his immune system eventually began to reject the donor face and it had to be removed. After months in hospital waiting for another face, a replacement was grafted into place in January. “The first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought ‘this is my new face’ and this time it’s the same,” said Hamon.Sandwiches and coffee – There’s a kick and a kiss for the fast-food business today. Pret a Manger has been censured by the advertising watchdog for callings its sandwiches “natural” when they’ve got E-numbers in them. Costa Coffee, though, has won praise for pledging to recycle the same number of disposable cups it turns over each year, by incentivising waste companies that have the special facilities to pulp them. “It dispels the myth that coffee cups can’t be recycled,” said Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa.‘Silent epidemic’ – Today in our Small Changes podcast series on remarkable iniduals tackling the world’s problems, meet the Kenyan cattle herder who became a doctor and malaria researcher as part of his lifelong mission to conquer the disease.The era of Castro rule is about to end – but on the street most Cubans seem indifferent. “I think everything’s going to stay the same,” says María Victoria Esteves, 27, about the news that President Raúl Castro will cede office this week to his vice-president, Miguel Díaz-Canel. Others are not even aware when canvassed, Ed Augustin discovers in Havana.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift in the Communist rule imposed by Fidel Castro six decades ago. His younger brother, now aged 86, will stay on as first secretary of the party until 2021 – “Raúl’s word will remain the last word,” says Cuba expert Hal Klepak. Brighton and Hove Albion have arrested a concerning run in the Premier League of one point from the last 15 with a much improved showing against Tottenham Hotspur. But the result left Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino lamenting a “lack of aggression” in a game he believed his side had dominated. Meanwhile, Wolves’ promotion next season will see the club come under closer scrutiny regarding its arrangement with Portuguese super-agent, Jorge Mendes.TalkSPORT has announced a massive shake-up in cricket broadcasting, securing the free-to-air broadcast rights of England’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies in a significant blow to the BBC. Elsewhere, Surrey’s Australian coach, Michael Di Venuto, has called for people to stop hounding disgraced cricketers Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, floating the idea that the trio could find a home in domestic cricket. And finally a new stadium for Cornish Pirates rugby club could be closer to realisation with Cornwall’s council agreeing to help meet construction costs.Asian shares crept ahead on Wednesday after Wall Street took heart from upbeat corporate earnings, though nagging concerns about trade barriers and the global growth outlook kept currencies and bonds subdued. China announced a timetable to open up its car market to imports, meeting a longtime demand of the US and other countries but hitting shares in China’s own automakers.The pound traded at $1.429 and €1.155 overnight. Discord within Labour and a fresh insult to Windrush families are among the stories that make the front pages today. The Times and the Telegraph both splash on growing dissent within the opposition over its leader’s stance on the Jewish community. The Telegraph says: “Enough is enough: Labour fury at Corbyn over anti-Semitism” while the Times goes with “Tensions in Labour erupt over rising abuse of Jews.”The Guardian keeps up the pressure on the government over citizens who came to Britain from the Caribbean with the lead story: “Home Office destroyed key data on Windrush citizens.” The Mail sings a similar tune with “Windrush: the new betrayal.” The Express, meanwhile, has a question for the former chancellor, after treasury said Britain was booming: “So George just how accurate was project fear then?” The Sun leads on Granbo (a pun on Rambo?) – the woman who shot an intruder with a crossbow.

The posters carry the emblem of the socialist feminist movement Rosa, and bear the slogan “Stop Shaming Women!”. When Kiely asks the man why he is removing the posters, he is heard replying: “None of your business”. The man does not reply when Kiely asks him: “Do you disagree about stopping shaming women, in 2018, that you have to tear the posters down off the wall?”Kiely then says: “C’mon, I’ll put you on the internet and you can tell the internet why you tore them down . . . You’ll go on Facebook tonight.” The man is filmed apparently trying to prevent Kiely from recording him. He asks Kiely to “stop filming” him. Kiely replies: “No I won’t. You’re in a public place. You just did something that is destruction of somebody’s else’s property in a public place, and I filmed you.” The man then removes two more posters from a pole and walks off. Asked why he confronted the man and filmed him, Kiely said he believed removing the posters was an act of “censorship”, and added, “I can’t condone that.” “There are ‘No’ posters and ‘Yes’ posters all the up along the street and people can vote for whoever they want.

Photograph: Google MapsDublin City Council has taken legal proceedings against large city centre pub Opium amid complaints from local residents and businesses following a multimillion euro makeover.The Mercantile Group establishment, which describes itself as a “pan-Asian restaurant, cocktail bar and nightlife destination” closed in May last year and reopened in January after a revamp estimated to have cost between €2 million and €4 million.In a recent letter to councillors, the Camden Village Residents’ \u0026amp Business Association said it had received an “unprecedented” number of noise complaints since the pub installed a rooftop smoking area and opening glass roof on its premises.Dublin City Council last month refused retention permission on the roof works and said it has now started legal proceedings over alterations that it says were carried out without proper planning permission.In its letter, the Camden association said “people cannot get a night’s sleep as the crowd noise from these open areas inside this venue can be heard very often until 2.30am or later”.It accused the Mercantile Group of behaving badly by failing to adhere to an enforcement notice issued by Dublin City Council last October.In response to a question from Fianna Fáil councillor Frank Kennedy, council management said “there is a live file on Opium, 26 Wexford Street”. “A Section 154 Notice was served on 13th October, 2017, requiring the removal of the steel structure and glazed roof and the reinstatement of the curved bitumen covered roof by 15th December, 2017. “The notice was not complied with and the matter is now the subject of legal proceedings.”A planning authority may issue a notice under section 154 of the Planning and Development Act if development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.The council said it refused to grant retention permission because the development gives rise to unacceptable noise levels and creates unacceptable noise levels which negatively affect the “residential environmental quality of the area”.The council carried out sound monitoring in the bedroom of a property on Camden Row over three days in February. “On each of these occasions crowd noise and music with a high bass content were clearly audible and at a level that would be considered intrusive,” the Dublin’s environmental health officer said.Opium is one of a number of Dublin establishments in the Mercantile hospitality group. Last year it lined up a €20 million investment programme, after its warring shareholder blocs formally ended a bitter legal wrangle.The Mercantile Group did not respond to a request for comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3464851.1523992279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mayo girl follows her dad to win texaco children s art competition","story":"Mayo artist, Hetty Lawlor, has been chosen as the overall winner of this years Texaco Art Competition for a portrait the judges called beautifully composed and perfectly executed. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Young Mayo artist Hetty Lawlor was the overall winner of the Texaco Children’s Art competition with her picture  entitled ‘Grainne’.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill It has been quite a year for the young Mayo artist Hetty Lawlor. The 17-year-old was a finalist in the Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year competition, which was broadcast earlier this year on British television, and this week she was crowned overall winner at the 64th Texaco Children’s Art competition, emulating the achievement of her father, who took home the top prize in 1984.Her winning entry, a portrait of a young neighbour called Grainne, which she completed in acrylic and colour pencil, was described by competition adjudicators as “a captivating portrait, beautifully composed, perfectly executed and lifelike in its use of colour, tone and texture.”She comes from an artistic family: her father Jimmy is an artist, her mother Phyl designs carpets and rugs and her sister Anna is studying animation in the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.She’s getting ready for the Leaving Cert and hopes to study Fine Art in Dún Laoghaire starting next September. The €1,500 top prize will, she said, take the sting off the first-year costs.She told The Irish Times she has been painting “for as long as I can remember but in a serious way since I was about 10”.She did not miss a beat when asked who her inspiration was. “I hate to be cringey but I have to say my dad. He won this competition when he was 16 and he is still an artist today and he is really happy with what he does, and I think that’s incredibly important.”Describing Hetty as “an exceptional talent”, the chairman of the judging panel Prof Declan McGonagle said she was “the latest in a generation of young prizewinners whose work is testament to depth of artistic ability existing in Ireland today and an illustration of the very high standard of entries being submitted”.She wasn’t the only second-generation winner at the competition this year. Remy Long is just seven years old and already he has gone one better than his dad Pierre.The older Long won distinctions twice in the 1980s but never managed to win the top prize – unlike Remy, who finished in the number one position in the 7 to 8-year-olds category for his portrait of a lionfish.Remy was slightly overawed by all the attention his work of art was getting and would only say that he was inspired to draw the lionfish after a trip to the French town of La Rochelle a couple of years ago.When asked what he plans to do with his €200 prize money, he said he didn’t know yet, though his older brothers figured he should spend it on a downpayment on a trip for the family to Legoland.Yuxuan Chen from Ballyroan, Dublin 16 won in the 12 to 13-year-old category for a self-portrait. Last year she was awarded a distinction so she was delighted to go one better. When asked what she was inspired by she said simply, “colours, I just love all the colours.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

But that same year - in order to treat nothing more than a common cold - he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment.In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face deteriorated.Last summer Hamon was hospitalised and in November his face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed.He remained in hospital without a face for two months, a very difficult time, while a compatible donor was sought.Everyone at the hospital \u0026quotwas blown away by Jerome\u0027s courage, his will, his strength of character in a tragic situation. While he was waiting he never complained, he was even in a good mood,\u0026quot recalled Bernard Cholley, an anaesthetist.Eventually, a face donor was found, a 22-year-old man who had died hundreds of kilometres from Paris. Lantieri heard the news on a Sunday in January and the massive logistical and medical operation was swiftly launched.The donor face was transported as quickly as possible by road on the Monday to the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.By late morning the following day, Hamon was being wheeled back to his hospital bed following the ground-breaking surgery, with his medical team noticing encouraging signs of good colour in his new face.The operation answers a key question for Lantieri and the rest of the medical world \u0026quotCan we redo a facial transplant? Yes, we can re-transplant and this is what you get!\u0026quotThe French medical team and Jerome Hanon at the Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou in ParisTo avoid any rejection, the patient underwent three months of special blood treatment prior to the transplant, nephrologist Eric Thervet explained.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon is a happy man again.\u0026quotThe first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought \u0027this is my new face\u0027 and this time it\u0027s the same,\u0026quot he explained.\u0026quotIf I hadn\u0027t accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It\u0027s a question of identity... But here we are, it\u0027s good, it\u0027s me.\u0026quotThere have now been around 40 face transplants throughout the world since the first was performed on Frenchwoman Isabelle Dinoire in northern France in 2005.Please review our commenting policyFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 to defend its sovereignty as it holds drills in Taiwan StraitFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Southwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftUK to enjoy hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveSting says cultural appropriation is \u0026#39ugly\u0026#39 term as he launches reggae album with ShaggySilicon Valley goes back to nature with bee and chicken keepingWindrush resident missed his mother\u0026#39s funeral after Britain banned him from coming homeStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsQueen \u0026#39hit extremely hard\u0026#39 by death of her beloved last Royal corgiRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000153741237_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSRVXbpq8Qb88-vCg29y97xVYbSxYKe4fwka48zLWQT4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"queen devastated loss last remaining corgi","story":"Daniel Craig and Queen Elizabeth II with her corgisThe Queen has reportedly been hit “extremely hard” by the loss of her corgi Willow who died on Sunday - ending Her Majesty’s close association with the breed dating back eight decades.The dog, which was 14th generation and descended from the Queen’s first dog Susan, was suffering from a cancer-related illness.It is understood The Queen did not want Willow, who was almost 15, to suffer any further. Insiders said she was hit “extremely hard” by the loss of Willow, who had become her most devoted companion.  As a descendant of Susan, who was an 18th birthday present when she was then Princess Elizabeth, Willow had a particularly close link with the Queen.On her 90th birthday, when she posed for portraits with her grandchildren, she also let her dogs share the limelight. Willow was one of four dogs at the time who featured in a picture with her, taken on steps in the grounds of Windsor castle.Corgis have played a massive role in Her Majesty\u0026#39s lifeA Buckingham Palace source told the Daily Mail: “She has mourned every one of her corgis over the years, but she has been more upset about Willow’s death than any of them… It is probably because Willow was the last link to her parents and a pastime that goes back to her own childhood. It really does feel like the end of an era.”It was reported that the Queen was still feeding and exercising Willow until the weekend, but the dog’s condition worsened.A vet was then said to have been called on Sunday afternoon, when Prince Philip was able to rejoin her after nearly two weeks in hospital following a hip operation.The Queen still has Vulcan and Candy, two dorgis - corgi-dachshund crosses, but Willow was the only dog left with a link to the Queen\u0027s original family of royal corgis.Last year Her Majesty agreed to adopt a corgi, Whisper, after the death of his owner, a former Sandringham gamekeeper.As a teenager, The Queen fell in love with her father\u0027s dog Dookie, a Pembrokeshire corgi, and wanted one of her own.She was subsequently given Susan and during her reign she has owned more than 30 corgis, many of them direct descendants of her first dog.Susan was so loved that she accompanied Her Majesty and The Duke of Edinburgh on on their honeymoon.Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip (left) with one of their corgis at Windsor Castle pictured in 1959 and Her Majesty walking her dogs in 1980 (right)Her descendant Willow appeared in the 2012 James Bond sketch which the Queen recorded with Daniel Craig for the London Olympics opening ceremony.The dog and two other corgis, Monty and Holly, greeted the secret agent, played by Daniel Craig, as he arrived at the palace to accept a mission from the Queen.The dogs ran down the stairs, performed tummy rolls and then stood as a helicopter took off for the Olympic stadium, carrying Bond and a stunt double of the Queen.Monty, who was 13, died a couple of months later.Holly was put down in October 2016 after suffering from an illness, leaving Willow as the Queen\u0027s final corgi.In 2015, the Queen decided to stop breeding Pembroke Welsh corgis over fears she might trip over and hurt herself over them. It was also reported that she didn’t want to leave any behind when she dies.Yet during her time looking after them, she has had more than 30 corgis stemming from Susan’s puppies Sugar and Honey, who were born in 1949.Queen Elizabeth II pictured walking her dogs in 1973 with a corgi leading the way and another ushering from behindBuckingham Palace declined to comment on the reports, saying it would be a private matter.Prince Harry revealed last year how his fiancee Meghan Markle had managed to charm the Queen\u0027s dogs.The prince said in his engagement interview: \u0026quotAnd the corgis took to you straightaway.\u0026quotI\u0027ve spent the last 33 years being barked at - this one walks in, absolutely nothing.\u0026quotDescribing the moment, Ms Markle said: \u0026quotJust laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet.\u0026quotThe Queen is synonymous with her love of corgis.The snappy little dogs had a penchant for nipping servants\u0027 ankles, but the Queen has always been devoted to them.She has owned more than 30 of the breed, as well as dorgis, black Labradors and cocker iels.Her first corgi, Susan, was given to her as an 18th birthday present by her parents in 1944.The Queen had fallen in love with her father\u0027s dog Dookie, a Pembrokeshire corgi, and wanted one of her own.Susan became the founder of the Queen\u0027s royal dog dynasty, and was even taken on honeymoon by Princess Elizabeth.But Susan was not always well-behaved. She bit a royal clockwinder on the ankle and was also rather partial to going for servants\u0027 legs.A corgi passes between two rugby players in 2007 when The Queen greeted internationals Her grandson, Whisky, apparently tore the seat out of a Guards officer\u0027s trousers.The Queen has looked after her own dogs as much as possible.She now has Whisper - a corgi she adopted after the death of its owner, a Sandringham gamekeeper - and two dorgis, Vulcan and Candy.During weekends at Windsor, the corgis went too and lived in her private apartments.She fed them herself, whenever her busy schedule permitted. She mixed their feed with a spoon and fork, from ingredients brought on a tray by a footman.She also enjoyed walking her corgis and they knew when it was time for their exercise.If the Queen came in wearing a tiara, they laid glumly on the carpet if she was in a headscarf, they knew it was time for walkies.The Duke of York said his mother\u0027s love of her corgis has helped to keep her fit.\u0026quotShe is just amazing at her age and she walks a long way, the dogs keep her active,\u0026quot Andrew said.Corgis are liable to bite people\u0027s legs because their forebears rounded up sheep by snapping at their feet.One footman at the Palace found a novel way of getting his own back.He spiked the dogs\u0027 food and water with whisky and gin, then watched in amusement as the tipsy animals staggered around. But he was discovered and demoted.At one stage, the Queen was forced to call in a dog psychiatrist when her corgis kept setting upon each other.The worst incident was when Ranger, who belonged to the Queen Mother, killed the Queen\u0027s dorgi Chipper in 1989.Two years later the Queen was bitten on the left hand while trying to break up a fight between six of her corgis and two of the Queen Mother\u0027s at Windsor.She needed three stitches and her chauffeur needed a tetanus jab.Canine psychiatrist Roger Mugford prescribed an ear-piercing rape alarm which the Queen used to break up the dog fights.He also sent the leader of the pack, Apollo, to live with the Princess Royal.But sometimes it was the corgis who found themselves under attack.In 2003, as the royals were gathering for Christmas at Sandringham in Norfolk, one suffered a tragic fate.Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh during their traditional summer break at Balmoral Castle. The royal couple are seen with \u0026#39Tinker\u0026#39, a cross between a corgi and long haired dachshundPharos - then one of the Queen\u0027s oldest corgis - was savaged by another dog and had to be put down.The Queen was devastated at the death of one of her favourite pets.Dottie, an English bull terrier owned by the Princess Royal, was blamed. The year before, Anne had been fined £500 when the same dog attacked two children in Windsor Great Park.But some days later, an announcement from the Palace revealed it was a case of mistaken identity. The real killer of Pharos was Florence, another of Anne\u0027s dogs.Pharos was buried in the Sandringham grounds, joining Susan and some of the other corgis with gravestones there.In 2012, the Queen\u0027s remaining corgis had a starring role in the James Bond sketch the Queen recorded for the London Olympics opening ceremony.Monty, Willow and Holly greeted the secret agent, played by Daniel Craig, as he arrived at the Palace to accept a mission from the Queen.Monty, who was 13, died a couple of months later.Holly was put down in October 2016 after suffering from an illness, leaving Willow, who died on Sunday, as the Queen\u0027s final corgi descended from Susan.Please review our commenting policyFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 to defend its sovereignty as it holds drills in Taiwan StraitFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Southwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftUK to enjoy hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveSting says cultural appropriation is \u0026#39ugly\u0026#39 term as he launches reggae album with ShaggySilicon Valley goes back to nature with bee and chicken keepingWindrush resident missed his mother\u0026#39s funeral after Britain banned him from coming homeStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesNHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"southwest airlines plane makes emergency landing engine broke","story":"A banking executive has died after being partially sucked out of a window of a US plane when an engine exploded in mid-air.Jennifer Riordan, a 43-year-old vice-president at Wells Fargo, was left hanging half outside the Southwest Airlines passenger jet at 32,000ft.Passengers scrambled to save the mother of two, who was partly sucked out of the Boeing 737 when the widow was smashed by debris. Mrs Riordan, who was returning from a business trip, later died and seven others were injured.The pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, was praised for her cool-headed handling of the emergency and described as having \u0026quotnerves of steel\u0026quot. In an air traffic control recording released by NBC News, the former Navy pilot is heard saying: \u0026quotWe have a part of the aircraft missing, so we\u0027re going to need to slow down a bit.\u0026quotAsked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: \u0026quotThey said there is a hole and someone went out.\u0026quotJennifer Riordan was left hanging half outside the Southwest Airlines passenger jet when a window was smashed by debrisSouthwest Airlines Flight 1380 was bound for Dallas from New York and had 149 people on board when it went into a rapid descent on Tuesday.The twin-engine jet made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged. Witnesses reported an engine on the left side of the plane blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. Mrs Riordan was pulled back in by other passengers, but later died.The seat where the victim was sitting when the engine reportedly hit into and broke one of the plane\u0026#39s windowsInitial findings said an engine fan blade was missing. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the shattered window had showed evidence of \u0026quotmetal fatigue\u0026quotPhotos of the plane on the ground showed a missing window and a chunk gone from the left engine, including part of its cover. A piece of the engine covering was later found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia.Photos posted by passengers showed a heavily damaged window near the damaged engine. Passengers reported seeing a woman being given medical attention on the plane.“One passenger, a woman, was partially … was drawn out towards the outside of the plane … was pulled back in by other passengers,\u0026quot Todd Burr, the father of another passenger, told NBC10.Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers said their prayers and braced for impact.Investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane \u0026quotI just remember holding my husband\u0027s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,\u0026quot said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York.\u0026quotAnd the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\u0027t grow up without parents.\u0026quotMs Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.Passengers on board the plane wear oxygen masks \u0026quotEverybody was crying and upset,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotYou had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \u0027It\u0027s OK! We\u0027re going to do this!\u0027\u0026quotShe added that passengers clapped and praised the pilot after the aircraft touched down.Passenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted, \u0026quotSomething is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!\u0026quotVideo: Passenger records mid-air drama on FacebookAfter the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.Ms Bourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.Tammie Jo Shults, a former Navy pilot, was at the controls when the plane made the emergency landing. She walked through the aisle and talked to passengers to make sure they were OK after the aircraft touched down.\u0026quotShe has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,\u0026quot said Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. \u0026quotI\u0027m going to send her a Christmas card, I\u0027m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.\u0026quotPilot Tammie Jo Shults was praised for her handling of the mid-air dramaIn a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, an unidentified crew member reported that there was a hole in the plane and \u0026quotsomeone went out.\u0026quotMr Tumlinson said a man in a cowboy hat rushed forward a few rows to grab the woman and pull her back in.\u0026quotShe was out of the plane. He couldn\u0027t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,\u0026quot he said.Passengers struggled to somehow plug the hole while giving the badly injured woman CPR.As the plane came in for a landing, everyone started yelling to brace for impact, then clapped after the aircraft touched down safely, Bourman said.The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window.The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s incident.It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotA Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida.Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Family, friends and community

suggeststhose weighing 60kg should not attend","story":"It\u0026#39s not only the models at catwalk shows that Zaihani Mohd Zain says should meet certain measurements A high profile Malaysian fashion critic has raised heckles by suggesting that people weighing more than 60kg (9.4 stone) should not attend catwalk events.Zaihani Mohd Zain, a well-known image consultant and stylist in Malaysia’s celebrity circles, commented on social media that people she considered plus-sized allowed their thighs to spill over onto the chairs next to them, reported the Malay Mail.“It’s so awkward and uncomfortable for the persons seated next to you!” said Ms Zain, who is seen regularly on the front rows of fashion shows.The post has since been removed, but not before her remarks prompted an immediate backlash on social media, including from major designers in the Malaysian fashion industry, who accused her of fat-shaming.“What right does one have to criticise plus size people  and telling them not to attend fashion shows?” said acclaimed designer Calvin Thoo on his Facebook page.His colleague, Datuk Tom Abang Saufi, followed suit, uploading a collage of pictures on Instagram that showed influential fashion figures, all of varying sizes.“Front row HEAVY WEIGHTS…fashion royalty…sizes and weights…NO ISSUE..,” she posted.The Bornean designer also shared pictures of her own fluctuating weight. “I’ve been many kilos different and done and attended many shows globally but never weight been an issue,” she said.The standout catwalk looks from Milan Fashion WeekMs Zain’s latest comments were not the first expression of her contentious views on weight.“If you love fashion and enjoy dressing up, then there are sacrifices to be made. Watch your weight. People may say size doesn’t matter but who are we kidding? It does!” she said in an earlier interview with Malaysia’s Tatler.Please review our commenting policyFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 to defend its sovereignty as it holds drills in Taiwan StraitFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Southwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftUK to enjoy hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveSting says cultural appropriation is \u0026#39ugly\u0026#39 term as he launches reggae album with ShaggySilicon Valley goes back to nature with bee and chicken keepingWindrush resident missed his mother\u0026#39s funeral after Britain banned him from coming homeStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsQueen \u0026#39hit extremely hard\u0026#39 by death of her beloved last Royal corgiRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18 april 2018","story":"A tarantula burger, Margot Robbie at the Formula E launch tour and a great egret are some of Wednesday\u0027s pictures of the dayFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 to defend its sovereignty as it holds drills in Taiwan StraitFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Southwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftUK to enjoy hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveSting says cultural appropriation is \u0026#39ugly\u0026#39 term as he launches reggae album with ShaggySilicon Valley goes back to nature with bee and chicken keepingWindrush resident missed his mother\u0026#39s funeral after Britain banned him from coming homeStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsQueen \u0026#39hit extremely hard\u0026#39 by death of her beloved last Royal corgiRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/18/TELEMMGLPICT000160752864_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sting says cultural appropriation ugly term launches reggae","story":"Sting and Shaggy are launching an album togetherSting has said the phrase \u0026quotcultural appropriation\u0026quot is \u0026quotugly\u0026quot, as he launches a new reggae album with Jamaican musician and singer Shaggy.Their perhaps unlikely partnership has raised eyebrows, and some argue that singing reggae when you are not of Jamaican descent is \u0026quotcultural appropriation.\u0026quotSting disagrees with this, and he told the BBC: \u0026quotIt\u0027s such an ugly term.\u0026quotFor me, reggae is something I respect and value, and take seriously. It\u0027s something I\u0027ve learned from.\u0026quotI owe a great deal to the whole reggae bass community. My spiritual, musical mentor was Bob Marley - who I knew - and I really feel that I\u0027m doing something that feels authentic to me.\u0026quotWorking with Shaggy gives it that extra edge. He\u0027s an authentic reggae dancehall superstar. I dabble and I dibble, but that was the common ground we had.\u0026quotCultural appropriation is a term coined by sociologists to describe the adoption of the elements of an ethnic minority culture by members of the dominant culture.  Their new collaboration, named 44876, after the telephone codes for the UK and Jamaica respectively, came about after Shaggy, real-name Orville Richard Burrell, sent Sting an unfinished song called \u0026quotDon\u0027t Make Me Wait\u0026quot and asked him to send the chorus.This work blossomed and they created an entire album together. Sting, real name Gordon Sumner, said the result was a \u0026quothappy accident.\u0026quotThe Queen is soon due to enjoy the music of Sting and Shaggy, as they are set to perform at her birthday party this Saturday at the Royal Albert Hall.44876 is released on Friday. Please review our commenting policyFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do

further this week.With highs of 25C, the temperature is expected to be more than 10C higher than the UK average for the time of year and London is set to be warmer than either Madrid or Rome.The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 20C-21C expected in Newcastle, 18C-19C in Northern Ireland and 17C in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said:

letter to Coinbase, Gemini, Bit Trust and other exchanges, requesting more facts for investors and traders in this emerging market.The Virtual Markets Integrity initiative could bring about tighter regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges.“With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money,” said Attorney General Schneiderman.Yet too often, consumers don’t have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms. “Our Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative sets out to change that, promoting the accountability and transparency in the virtual currency marketplace that investors and consumers deserve.”Bitcoin boosted as IMF boss praises cryptocurrencyBitcoin price rockets by more than $1,000 in bizarre surgeExperts predict \u0027crazy’ price gains for bitcoinA questionnaire sent to each exchange requests information about trading policies and procedures, basic operation and fees, as well as controls to prevent money laundering and hacks.Although the initiative is designed to protect the interests of New York residents who trade cryptocurrency with these exchanges, the international nature of the businesses means the outcome of the probe could have wide-reaching consequences.The investigation comes just a day after International Monetary Fund (IMF) boss Christine Lagarde called for an even-handed approach to regulation in the cryptocurrency space. Ms Lagarde explained the global benefits of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency in an official blog on the IMF\u0027s website, saying that sensible regulatory measures could help realise the potential of digital currencies and their underlying technology. “Just as a few technologies that emerged from the dot-com era have transformed our lives, the crypto assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills,” Ms Lagarde wrote.“An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups. This Keep Cup Brew, cork edition, travel cup in Fika is just one of the many available to purchase.

Handmade in Scotland, the bunting comprises thirteen brightly coloured pennants which spell out the words \u0027Happy Birthday\u0027, and uses lettering that has been printed onto 100 per cent recycled card. Included is 11ft of natural jute twine to hang the pennants on, and everything comes packaged in a cello bag. You can buy this bunting from Little Silverleaf on notonthehighstreet.com for £12.50.Swap plastic straws for reusable ones made of bamboo. These straws are handmade in Bali and crafted by local balinese artisans. Made of organic and natural materials they are the best eco-friendly alternative to plastic, steel or glass straws. You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups. This Keep Cup Brew, cork edition, travel cup in Fika is just one of the many available to purchase.

These straws are handmade in Bali and crafted by local balinese artisans. Made of organic and natural materials they are the best eco-friendly alternative to plastic, steel or glass straws. You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May hosts a meeting with leaders and representatives of Caribbean countries, at 10 Downing Street on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.Aneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Remnants of those early planets have never been found.“Because we had collisions you should find some remnants of that,” said Prof Gillet, explaining what led him and his team to the Almahata Sitta meteorite.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceNasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Last week he left the hospital for a weekend to visit his family in Brittany.“If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible,” he told AFP news agency. ”It’s a question of identity... But here we are, it’s good, it’s me.”He added: “He never complained. We felt we were dealing with someone exceptional.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
