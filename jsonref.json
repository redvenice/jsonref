Onset for the disease is usually 65 and older.There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease currently, though various medication and management strategies may help to alleviate symptoms on a temporary basis. Not much is known about the cause of the disease, though about 70 percent of the risk is believed to be genetic. Other risk factors are believed to be hypertension, depression and head injuries.Named after German pathologist and psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease currently impacts approximately 29.8 million people worldwide as of 2015.Alexander Povetkin net worth: Anthony Joshua\u0027s opponent\u0027s wealth revealed ahead of fightThe Best FIFA Football Awards 2018: Everything you need to knowUnder Armour Project Rock: The Rock releases new Under Armour sneakers and clothingEuroMillions results: National Lottery numbers for Friday, 21 SeptemberBachelor 2019: Colton\u0027s cast, start date, spoilers and moreLil Wayne Tha Carter V: Weezy fans vent on Twitter after long-awaited album isn\u0027t releasedWhen is the X Factor 2018 final and how to get tickets revealedX Factor 2018 spoilers: Judges\u0027 categories, guest stars, final date and more revealed Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood star is celebrated with a Google DoodleWho is Khabib Nurmagomedov?

To me, if I\u0027m getting my picture taken, it\u0027s modeling, even if it\u0027s for my own brand.\u0027She joked and added she\u0027ll quit \u0027when people stop asking.

It\u0027s always like, \u0027\u0027More, more, more.\u0027\u0027\u0027And so I think that sometimes for young models, and especially when you\u0027re young, you\u0027re not always so, \u0027\u0027Hmm, is this a good thing to post, or a bad thing to post?\u0027\u0027\u0027You know you\u0027re young you make mistakes.

Everyone\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027What\u0027s with those melons? Where can I get the melons?\u0027\u0027 \u0027But you can only get them in the south of France and you can only get them fresh for like two weeks out of the summer.\u0027 Crawford spoke of her pride at having not rested on her laurels despite earning millions as the face of huge advertising campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s.She described it as using the \u0027momentum from modeling and turning it into a business.\u0027The mother-of-two said: \u0027I think what\u0027s exciting to me is not only when women come up to me and tell me they love Meaningful Beauty, but when young models come up to me and say, \u0027\u0027I want a career like yours. I want to have a long career. I want to own my own brand. I want to be in charge of my own image.\u0027\u0027 \u0027So in that way, I guess it\u0027s very rewarding being a role model, especially as now my own daughter is starting her own path into the fashion industry and I\u0027m around a lot more young models and even her friends will come to me for advice, so it\u0027s sweet.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/22/14/508834D300000578-0-image-m-13_1537621750950.jpg","title":"Oliver Olivia popular baby names second year running Muhammad tops list London","story":"    The most popular baby names in England and Wales were Oliver and Olivia in 2017 Shocking revelation only a quarter of kids are vaccinated...Number of foreign nurses arriving in the UK from outside the...Share this articleOlly (Oliver) Murs and Prince Harry may have something to do with most popular boys\u0027 names while actress Olivia Coleman and little Royal Mia Tindall may have influenced baby naming      David Beckham pictured with Harper, 7, who may have inspired rise in numbers of the name Despite Lily still placing in the top ten for girls, three fewer baby girls were given the name in the most recent stats, possibly owing to the antics of Lily Allen in the media.The singer recently published a book, \u0027My Thoughts Exactly even slamming her own father and admitting to having slept with female prostitutes following the breakdown of her marriage to Sam Cooper and said that she was feeling \u0027lost and lonely\u0027.

He examined the drowned bodies after the Marchioness tragedy in which a Thames pleasure boat sank with the loss of 51 lives in 1989. He was in Bali after the terrorist bomb attacks in 2002 and carried out post-mortems after the London 77 bombings in 2005, having sifted through human remains in the aftermath of 911 in New York four years earlier.After Princess Diana died in August 1997, he re-examined her body for the official inquiry into her death. He also carried out the post-mortems on young mother Rachel Nickell, murdered on Wimbledon Common in 1992, and Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager stabbed to death in a racial attack a year later.Every day he confronts death and sometimes disaster. Yet of all these tragedies and others, familial, national and global, it was Hungerford that prompted the first symptoms in an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder so profound, it led him to thoughts of suicide.          \u0027Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces,\u0027 said pathologist Dr Richard ShepherdThree years ago — almost 30 years after he had driven through the town in the ghostly half-light that summer evening after the killings — Richard was piloting the small plane he flies for pleasure when he noticed that, quite by chance, he was flying over the town.\u0027I looked down and there was Hungerford,\u0027 Richard, now 65, recalls. \u0027It was as random as that. I started to feel something like nausea, but more ominous.\u0027It came from deep inside me, forcing its way through my body with such power I felt breathless. I felt unhappiness and dread a sense that something terrible was about to happen — even an urge to make it happen — and a ludicrous thought crossed my mind. What if I got out of the plane? I struggled to stay in my seat, to keep breathing, to control the plane.\u0027Then I flew over Savernake Forest and the feeling passed. But it had never happened before in the whole of my career and it was the first intimation that things were building up, an early sign of PTSD.\u0027During 30 years I\u0027d seen bodies in death, decomposition and after illness, crimes and disasters, yet it was the first time I thought my job could have emotional repercussions.\u0027          He also worked on Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a racial attack in 1993\u0027I considered various possibilities. I was going to take my seatbelt off and crash the car at speed. I thought it wouldn\u0027t involve anyone else.\u0027But the nurse said: \u0027What about the people who have to sort it all out? And how will your family feel?\u0027Fortunately, the suicidal thoughts soon passed and within a year Richard had stopped taking medication.But the respite from work gave him time to write a memoir, Unnatural Causes, which is just published.\u0027It wasn\u0027t an exercise in self-analysis but it proved therapeutic to be a bit more introspective about my work,\u0027 he says today. \u0027The writing became a sort of therapy.\u0027And I think it\u0027s important people understand what we pathologists do, that we\u0027re not Dracula figures, that our job is a traumatic one and that society needs someone to do it.\u0027We need to know how and why our citizens die, that there isn\u0027t another Harold Shipman around.\u0027 (Richard was also involved in the case of the Greater Manchester GP who killed more than 200 patients before his arrest in 1998.)The man I meet is affable, easy company, with the fluency of thought and speech of someone accustomed to commanding an audience. Tall and long-limbed, with piercing blue eyes and tousled grey hair, he is relaxed in off-duty casuals.He has two children — Chris, 37, a vet, and Anna, 35, a hospital pathologist — from his first marriage to Jen, another doctor, and two grandchildren. When he married Linda, a widow, in 2008, he became stepdad to her three grown-up girls.Revealed: Orla Kiely and husband paid themselves £400,000 as...British museums and US hedge funds battle over £15m Titanic...Share this articleHis marriage to Jen, which ended in orce, was a casualty of their demanding careers. \u0027Our lives were hectic and complicated and our relationship sagged beneath our workloads,\u0027 he says. \u0027One of us was always rushing in as the other rushed out.\u0027His job consumed him. Once, his children walked unannounced into his study to find him stabbing a pillow with a ruler, trying to work out the mechanics of a murder.His ambition to become a forensic pathologist took root early when, as a schoolboy, he became enthralled by a textbook on the subject.When he dissected his first cadaver, the initial fear and revulsion was quickly usurped by a fascination that absorbs him to this day.He writes of a \u0027sense of wonder\u0027 at the human body: \u0027Its intricate systems, its colours and, yes, its beauty. For blood is not just red, it is bright red. The gall bladder is not just green, it is the green of jungle foliage. The brain is white and grey — and that is not the grey of a November sky, it is the silver-grey of darting fish. The liver is not a dull school-uniform brown, it is the sharp red-brown of a freshly ploughed field.\u0027He says he learnt early in his career to isolate himself from the horror of the bodies he dealt with every day, while engaging fully with the intricate business of examining them.He also had to learn to leave the sights of the mortuary behind as he walked through the door and out into \u0027the world of daylight, children and home\u0027.He wonders now whether this continual slipping between horror and mundanity might have precipitated his breakdown. \u0027It became harder and harder to clear the images from my mind,\u0027 he admits.

When he carried out the second autopsy on Princess Diana, for example, he must have been besieged by questions. \u0027People asked: \u0027Was she beautiful?\u0027 \u0027Was she peaceful?\u0027 \u0027Was she pregnant?\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadn\u0027t already appeared in the Press.\u0027Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?\u0027He leaves the question hanging, adding: \u0027I wish I could say she would have died whatever happened, but the fact is, if she had worn her seatbelt she would have been here for Prince William and Harry\u0027s weddings.He believes that, had she been strapped in, \u0027she would have walked away with a black eye or maybe a broken arm, but nothing more. Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces.\u0027He says, too, that there is no enhancement of the procedures and protocols, no extra level of care or commitment, for celebrities or royals apart from a more senior police officer being present.          Forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd (pictured) featured on Autopsy on NetflixHe recalls other high-profile cases: it was he who suggested that a forensic psychologist should be flown in from the U.S. to help solve Rachel Nickell\u0027s murder. And long before Colin Stagg was acquitted of the crime, Richard suspected that the actual killer, Robert Napper — now remanded indefinitely in Broadmoor high-security hospital — was guilty.He did so because he carried out a post-mortem on one of Napper\u0027s subsequent victims, Samantha Bisset, and noted similarities in the method of the two young mothers\u0027 murders both had been stabbed in a frenzied way.He is an expert on knives: he notes the angles at which blades penetrate flesh, the bruises made by the hilt, marks that indicate whether a wound is self-inflicted. And he has developed the capacity to sketch a murder weapon accurately by the track it leaves on a body. Invariably, he can also identify a knife used in a stabbing.\u0027I was always rooting around in the kitchen at home for a knife to stick into a joint of meat,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027d use pork bellies, cow kidneys and joints of beef for stabbing exercises.\u0027He remarks that when he was called to perform a routine post-mortem on a young black man called Stephen Lawrence, who had been fatally stabbed, he had no idea he would give evidence so many times at future dates about the 18-year-old\u0027s murder.\u0027Public scorn at the failure to arrest Stephen\u0027s attackers reached such a pitch that it really began to seem that demands for an inquiry into the Met\u0027s investigative failures would be met,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I was delighted by the strong move for change which forced a rethink in official and police culture.\u0027He has seen great advances, too, in methods of identifying bodies.Until 2000, fingerprints and dental records were used. He recalls the furore among relatives of those drowned in the Marchioness disaster when, advised not to see their loved ones\u0027 bodies as they were decomposed, it later emerged that some victims\u0027 hands had been removed for identification.\u0027In their position I would have been angry too,\u0027 Richard concedes. But breakthroughs in DNA technology meant that by the time of the 911 attacks, the dead could be identified swiftly by minuscule fragments of material alone.For those who worry that autopsies involve desecration or disfigurement of the dead, Dr Shepherd offers reassurance.\u0027When I perform a post-mortem, I am ascertaining the exact cause of death and doing my job with care and respect. And after I\u0027ve discovered the truth, the bodies are restored faithfully by mortuary technicians.\u0027I don\u0027t feel grief as I incise a body, but I do when I see others suffering their loss.\u0027Unnatural Causes: The Life And Many Deaths Of Britain\u0027s Top Forensic Pathologist, by Dr Richard Shepherd, is published by Michael Joseph."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4CF97B5B00000578-0-image-a-54_1528371819137.jpg","title":"United Nations environment boss slammed flying much","story":"    Erik Solheim reportedly ran up a huge travel billThe United Nations environment chief has been criticised by his own organisation for his globe-trotting lifestyle and heavy carbon footprint.Erik Solheim reportedly ran up a huge travel bill and showed scant regard for rules, according to a leaked draft internal audit report.The damning dossier said Mr Solheim was travelling for 529 out of the 668 days covered by the audit investigation.As executive director of the UN Environment Programme he also spent a total of £370,380 during the same period.The audit said he had \u0027no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules\u0027 and had been guilty of claiming unjustified expenses.There have been concerns from some UN Environment officials that Mr Solheim has been guilty of employing a \u0027haphazard and dictatorial management style\u0027 and has made the body \u0027dysfunctional in many respects\u0027.Mr Solheim said he had already paid back money where there had been \u0027oversights\u0027 and made changes where rules had been broken.The former Norwegian politician refused to comment in detail until the audit had been published in full, but he said that if there were other matters to address he would do so in the future.\u0027To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as iniduals, as society, indeed as the UN,\u0027 he said. \u0027No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systematic change often brings.\u0027UN chief calls for action against the ‘plastic pandemic’...Share this articleThe draft audit, which was given to The Guardian newspaper, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services and has still to be finalised.One of the major criticisms Mr Solheim faced was for a weekend trip he took from the US to France and back.According to the UN, his \u0027extensive travel patterns\u0027 did not set an example to the rest of the UN staff to follow.The report added that his \u0027extensive travel\u0027 was a reputational risk to the UN because the organisation was supposed to be \u0027the lead on sustainable environment matters\u0027.It said the UN Environment Programme did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions.In August Mr Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine that people should not have a \u0027guilty conscience\u0027 about flying and even admitted to holding gold frequent flyer cards with three major airlines.          Mr Solheim, 63, speaking during a press conference in North Korea last monthMr Solheim, 63, is a former diplomat and was leader of the Socialist Left Party in Norway between April 1987 and May 1997. The married father-of-four took up his current role with the UN in June 2016.The leaked document also criticises Mr Solheim\u0027s management style and said he showed \u0027willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as \u0027bureaucratic\u0027. Even his expensive travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him and was not someone more senior.In future Mr Solheim\u0027s travel will be approved by the office of the secretary general.In one spat involving the number of days he had spent in Oslo and Paris on \u0027official travel\u0027 he replied in an email: \u0027We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job... we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am factory worker... the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.\u0027Mr Solheim told The Guardian: \u0027It\u0027s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe in fully reforming the UN so we\u0027re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.\u0027Truls Gulowsen, the head of campaign group Greenpeace in Norway, said: \u0027This report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of the UN\u0027s entire environmental organisation.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/18/5021EDAC00000578-0-image-m-53_1536859532766.jpg","title":"Yoko Ono hand picked mistress John Lennon covered took lover","story":"    View of the back cover of the record album \u0027Two Virgins,\u0027 by John Lennon and Japanese-born artist Yoko Ono in 1968After nearly five years of being together, night and day, the myth of perfect love the couple had woven around themselves — ‘like Cathy and Heathcliff’ as Yoko liked to say in reference to Wuthering Heights — had been shattered.Sex was the last thing on his mind when John Lennon, then aged 25, was first introduced to Yoko Ono.The year was 1966. He’d wandered into the basement of an art gallery, where a very small Japanese lady in black, peering out from between two curtains of hair, was busily preparing an exhibition. It was called Unfinished Paintings And Objects By Yoko Ono, and was due to open the following day.Yoko — then aged 33 — didn’t recognise John. Then a little-known conceptual artist, she was on a visit to London with her husband and daughter and had seized a rare opportunity to publicise her work.To John, however, it all seemed very silly at first. But he liked silliness, so he decided to go along with it.‘Anyway, I’m looking for the action, and I see this thing called Hammer A Nail,’ he recalled. ‘It’s a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it, and a bunch of nails at the bottom, and I said: “Can I hammer a nail into it?” She said: “No”, and walked away.’But when the gallery owner told Yoko she’d just said ‘No’ to John Lennon, she walked straight back and asked him for five shillings.John said he didn’t have five shillings because he never carried money. ‘What if I give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer in an imaginary nail. Would that be all right?’ he asked.Yoko agreed that it would indeed be all right.At that point, he knew nothing about her, other than the fact that she was making a short movie, Bottoms (Film No. 4), having put an advertisement in a newspaper for ‘intelligent-looking bottoms’. She’d then filmed 365 of them.Was he attracted to Yoko? Unlikely. If he had been, she’d have known about it, because he certainly wasn’t shy about making his intentions clear. Yet there was something intriguing about her. She might seem half-crazy but she was an enigma, and he’d never met anyone like her before.One day, this odd little Japanese woman would change his life. But back then, John didn’t give her much thought he didn’t even go to her exhibition launch.Yoko, however, decided to pursue John by letter. Viewing him as a multi-millionaire with money to burn, she was determined to win his financial backing for her art.The idea that she ran after John, she’d say later, wasn’t true. Others might say she never left him alone.Finally, in October 1967, John caved in, agreeing to sponsor an exhibition that consisted of half of everything — a bed, a chair and a room — all painted white. He didn’t actually turn up to see it, but Yoko was starting to get under his skin.Then, to his wife Cynthia’s surprise, the Japanese lady turned up at a private meeting. The Lennons and the other Beatles had gone to see the assistant to the Maharishi, an Indian yogi whom they all planned to visit at his Himalayan ashram.\u0027It\u0027s an incredible day for me to finally go to bed with...They\u0027ll need a hedge fund! Owners of world\u0027s highest...More than just a ticket to ride! Stars come out for Paul...John Lennon broke up the Beatles, NOT Yoko: Paul McCartney...Share this articleYoko was already there when they walked in, sitting in a corner armchair. She didn’t explain her presence and John appeared not to notice her.Afterwards, things got even odder. As John and Cynthia walked towards their chauffeur-driven car, Yoko climbed in ahead of them. Even John looked surprised, Cynthia recalled, though he politely asked Yoko if they could give her a lift anywhere.‘Yes, please,’ Yoko said, giving the chauffeur her address. The journey passed in complete silence.‘What was all that about?’ Cynthia asked John afterwards. He said he didn’t know. What he didn’t say was that he’d already seen Yoko several times.A few months before, he’d invited her to a Beatles session at Abbey Road. She had not been bowled over. ‘Why don’t you do something more complex?’ she asked.John had then suggested they go to an assistant’s flat, where he confidently expected to have sex with Yoko. But she’d found his approach crude.Her rejection only made her seem more beguiling and mysterious. By the following month, John had decided that when he went to India, he’d take both Cynthia and Yoko with him — but he lost his nerve at the last minute. Had Yoko still expected to be going to India when she turned up at the meeting? It would appear so.Unwittingly, Cynthia made the break-up easier for John by going on two holidays in quick succession in 1968. After the first, she came home to find John and Yoko — wearing the Lennons’ towelling bathrobes — sitting cross-legged on the floor.It was obvious they’d spent the night together, but Cynthia gave John another chance. The next time he didn’t even wait for her to get home: he sent a minion to Italy to tell her he wanted a orce.The little Japanese lady had won. That same week, in May 1968, the new couple went public, with Yoko clinging to John’s protective arm.In private, he made her write down a list of all the men she’d slept with before they met.Then, as he told me, he made a list for her of all the serious affairs he’d had, going right back to girls in Liverpool whom Cynthia had known nothing about.          John Lennon and May Pang - John Lennon and May Pang, who was wife Yoko\u0027s secretary, had an affair at the end of 1970sSoon John and Yoko would dress in matching white suits, both parting their long hair down the middle. For John, it was a matter of ‘I am he as you are he as you are me and we are altogether’, as he’d sung in I Am The Walrus.In The Beatles, he’d always seen himself as the front man, but now he began to subsume his personality into that of Yoko. One of their first joint enterprises was to make a narcissistic film that merged their faces together.They were now a brand — ‘JohnandYoko’ — and John threw his energies into promoting it. There was Yoko’s balloon event — 365 white ones bearing the message ‘You are here’ were released — then a film of John smiling, which lasted over 30 minutes.Most critics viewed these as no more than Yoko’s vanity projects. For ‘JohnandYoko’ to catch the public imagination, they needed to do something seriously outrageous. So they did. John decided to have them both photographed naked from the back and front, and to use the images on their first joint LP, Unfinished Music No 1: Two Virgins.Then there was a film, Self Portrait, that focused for 20 minutes on John’s private parts. Yoko was at last becoming famous.As work began on a new Beatles LP — The White Album — John insisted she be with him in the studio. The first major casualty was the Lennon-McCartney songwriting relationship.Paul later told me: ‘If I started to think of a line, I’d begin to get very nervous. I might want to say something like “I love you, girl”, but with Yoko watching I always felt that I had to come up with something clever and avant-garde.‘John and I tried writing together a few more times, but I think we both decided it would be easier to work separately.’As PAUL freely admitted, he was annoyed with John, and jealous of Yoko. But he bit his lip and tried to keep his feelings to himself.‘It’s going to be a comical thing in 50 years’ time,’ he told George Harrison, ‘if people say that The Beatles broke up because Yoko sat on an amp.’Amps weren’t the half of it.Later, after Yoko suffered a whiplash injury when John pranged their car during a driving tour of Scotland, four porters wheeled a bed into the studio so she could watch proceedings in comfort, propped up on pillows.The fun was going out of being a Beatle. And, in private, John was now indulging in a far more dangerous kind of fun: heroin. Yoko had tried some at a party and enjoyed it, so he decided to have a go himself.Soon he was hooked. ‘I never injected,’ he’d say. ‘Just sniffing, you know.’ But he rarely did anything he liked by halves, so his denial is questionable.John — who’d always had a callous streak — would speak to Cynthia only once more before the orce. ‘My final offer is £75,000,’ he told the woman he’d once loved to distraction. ‘That’s like winning the pools for you. So, what are you moaning about? You’re not worth any more.’ In the end, they settled for £100,000 (about £1.5 million today).As for Yoko’s husband, Tony Cox, who was caring for their child, John paid him off with £40,000 and despatched him to get a quickie orce in the Virgin Islands. Interestingly, Yoko was less keen than her lover on remarrying. ‘I didn’t like the idea of limiting myself to one man again,’ she said, though she eventually agreed to a low-key wedding in Gibraltar.John was jubilant at having married into the avant-garde intelligentsia. With his new wife, he was no longer just a Beatle: he could take his place as a true ‘artist’ — a word he used constantly in conversations about himself.After all his frenetic years on the road, John, now 28, was going to slow down — ‘because I don’t want to die when I’m 40’.By 1971, John and Yoko had settled in New York.

Its sole purpose of to find Maddie, support her family and bring her abductors to justice.A sum of £750,000 is left in the pot which the McCanns will dip into to pay for their own private investigators if the police search is shelved. But a threat of losing a vast chunk of the money in a bitter legal battle which is still ongoing against a former Portuguese police chief looms over them.

He told news website Portugal Resident.com that the couple should explain \u0027how much money they have spent on lawyers\u0027 fees\u0027, adding: \u0027These were thousands of pounds not spent on looking for their daughter.\u0027    The McCanns are still waiting to fund out if Scotland Yard will request extra cash to keep the search for Maddie going when their current funding runs out in just eight daysOver the years money had been flooding into the Fund - which once topped nearly £2million - much it from online sales of merchandise to help the search for Maddie, who would now be aged 15.

But over the years is has dwindled to a few thousands pounds and now virtually nothing.Kate\u0027s 2011 best-selling book \u0027Madeleine\u0027, with serialisation rights, netted her £1million which she ploughed into the Fund.Together with serialisation deals, it is understood the book — which became a best-seller — has raised nearly £1million for the fund, which has six trustees including Kate and Gerry, both 50.Kate and gerry are now \u0027keeping fingers crossed\u0027 the search for Maddie will carry on for another six monthsTheir pal said: \u0027The funding is down to the Home Office and the police.

Governor of the Bank of England at the time, Mervyn King, holding the new Adam Smith £20 note which went into circulation in March 2007Adam Smith was a Scottish economist, philosopher, author and a pioneer of political economy.He was a moral philosopher and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as being considered the father of modern economics.In 2006 it was announced Adam Smith would replace Edward Elgar on the £20 and go into circulation the following year.He will be replaced on the banknote by painter Joseph Turner in 2020.Smith is best known for two classic works, namely An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations in 1776, when was aged 52, and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759.The second book is usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, and is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics.Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory and against oppressive tariffs with The Wealth of Nations as a precursor to the modern academic study of economics.His writing came mostly from his own observations of the workings of industry and cross-border trade.In this and his other works, he developed the concept of ision of labour and looked at upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity.Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift.He has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, with bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society and the Australian Adam Smith Club, named after him.In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.The minor planet 12838 Adamsmith was named in his memory after the asteroid was discovered in March 1997 by Belgian astronomer Eric Walter Elst in Chile.

Mr Solheim, 63, speaking during a press conference in North Korea last monthMr Solheim, 63, is a former diplomat and was leader of the Socialist Left Party in Norway between April 1987 and May 1997. The married father-of-four took up his current role with the UN in June 2016.The leaked document also criticises Mr Solheim\u0027s management style and said he showed \u0027willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as \u0027bureaucratic\u0027. Even his expensive travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him and was not someone more senior.In future Mr Solheim\u0027s travel will be approved by the office of the secretary general.In one spat involving the number of days he had spent in Oslo and Paris on \u0027official travel\u0027 he replied in an email: \u0027We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job... we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am factory worker... the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.\u0027Mr Solheim told The Guardian: \u0027It\u0027s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system.

He’d wandered into the basement of an art gallery, where a very small Japanese lady in black, peering out from between two curtains of hair, was busily preparing an exhibition. It was called Unfinished Paintings And Objects By Yoko Ono, and was due to open the following day.Yoko — then aged 33 — didn’t recognise John. Then a little-known conceptual artist, she was on a visit to London with her husband and daughter and had seized a rare opportunity to publicise her work.To John, however, it all seemed very silly at first. But he liked silliness, so he decided to go along with it.‘Anyway, I’m looking for the action, and I see this thing called Hammer A Nail,’ he recalled. ‘It’s a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it, and a bunch of nails at the bottom, and I said: “Can I hammer a nail into it?” She said: “No”, and walked away.’But when the gallery owner told Yoko she’d just said ‘No’ to John Lennon, she walked straight back and asked him for five shillings.John said he didn’t have five shillings because he never carried money. ‘What if I give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer in an imaginary nail. Would that be all right?’ he asked.Yoko agreed that it would indeed be all right.At that point, he knew nothing about her, other than the fact that she was making a short movie, Bottoms (Film No. 4), having put an advertisement in a newspaper for ‘intelligent-looking bottoms’. She’d then filmed 365 of them.Was he attracted to Yoko? Unlikely. If he had been, she’d have known about it, because he certainly wasn’t shy about making his intentions clear. Yet there was something intriguing about her. She might seem half-crazy but she was an enigma, and he’d never met anyone like her before.One day, this odd little Japanese woman would change his life. But back then, John didn’t give her much thought he didn’t even go to her exhibition launch.Yoko, however, decided to pursue John by letter. Viewing him as a multi-millionaire with money to burn, she was determined to win his financial backing for her art.The idea that she ran after John, she’d say later, wasn’t true. Others might say she never left him alone.Finally, in October 1967, John caved in, agreeing to sponsor an exhibition that consisted of half of everything — a bed, a chair and a room — all painted white. He didn’t actually turn up to see it, but Yoko was starting to get under his skin.Then, to his wife Cynthia’s surprise, the Japanese lady turned up at a private meeting. The Lennons and the other Beatles had gone to see the assistant to the Maharishi, an Indian yogi whom they all planned to visit at his Himalayan ashram.\u0027It\u0027s an incredible day for me to finally go to bed with...They\u0027ll need a hedge fund! Owners of world\u0027s highest...More than just a ticket to ride! Stars come out for Paul...John Lennon broke up the Beatles, NOT Yoko: Paul McCartney...Share this articleYoko was already there when they walked in, sitting in a corner armchair. She didn’t explain her presence and John appeared not to notice her.Afterwards, things got even odder. As John and Cynthia walked towards their chauffeur-driven car, Yoko climbed in ahead of them. Even John looked surprised, Cynthia recalled, though he politely asked Yoko if they could give her a lift anywhere.‘Yes, please,’ Yoko said, giving the chauffeur her address. The journey passed in complete silence.‘What was all that about?’ Cynthia asked John afterwards. He said he didn’t know. What he didn’t say was that he’d already seen Yoko several times.A few months before, he’d invited her to a Beatles session at Abbey Road. She had not been bowled over. ‘Why don’t you do something more complex?’ she asked.John had then suggested they go to an assistant’s flat, where he confidently expected to have sex with Yoko. But she’d found his approach crude.Her rejection only made her seem more beguiling and mysterious. By the following month, John had decided that when he went to India, he’d take both Cynthia and Yoko with him — but he lost his nerve at the last minute. Had Yoko still expected to be going to India when she turned up at the meeting? It would appear so.Unwittingly, Cynthia made the break-up easier for John by going on two holidays in quick succession in 1968. After the first, she came home to find John and Yoko — wearing the Lennons’ towelling bathrobes — sitting cross-legged on the floor.It was obvious they’d spent the night together, but Cynthia gave John another chance. The next time he didn’t even wait for her to get home: he sent a minion to Italy to tell her he wanted a orce.The little Japanese lady had won. That same week, in May 1968, the new couple went public, with Yoko clinging to John’s protective arm.In private, he made her write down a list of all the men she’d slept with before they met.Then, as he told me, he made a list for her of all the serious affairs he’d had, going right back to girls in Liverpool whom Cynthia had known nothing about.          John Lennon and May Pang - John Lennon and May Pang, who was wife Yoko\u0027s secretary, had an affair at the end of 1970sSoon John and Yoko would dress in matching white suits, both parting their long hair down the middle. For John, it was a matter of ‘I am he as you are he as you are me and we are altogether’, as he’d sung in I Am The Walrus.In The Beatles, he’d always seen himself as the front man, but now he began to subsume his personality into that of Yoko. One of their first joint enterprises was to make a narcissistic film that merged their faces together.They were now a brand — ‘JohnandYoko’ — and John threw his energies into promoting it. There was Yoko’s balloon event — 365 white ones bearing the message ‘You are here’ were released — then a film of John smiling, which lasted over 30 minutes.Most critics viewed these as no more than Yoko’s vanity projects. For ‘JohnandYoko’ to catch the public imagination, they needed to do something seriously outrageous. So they did. John decided to have them both photographed naked from the back and front, and to use the images on their first joint LP, Unfinished Music No 1: Two Virgins.Then there was a film, Self Portrait, that focused for 20 minutes on John’s private parts. Yoko was at last becoming famous.As work began on a new Beatles LP — The White Album — John insisted she be with him in the studio. The first major casualty was the Lennon-McCartney songwriting relationship.Paul later told me: ‘If I started to think of a line, I’d begin to get very nervous. I might want to say something like “I love you, girl”, but with Yoko watching I always felt that I had to come up with something clever and avant-garde.‘John and I tried writing together a few more times, but I think we both decided it would be easier to work separately.’As PAUL freely admitted, he was annoyed with John, and jealous of Yoko. But he bit his lip and tried to keep his feelings to himself.‘It’s going to be a comical thing in 50 years’ time,’ he told George Harrison, ‘if people say that The Beatles broke up because Yoko sat on an amp.’Amps weren’t the half of it.Later, after Yoko suffered a whiplash injury when John pranged their car during a driving tour of Scotland, four porters wheeled a bed into the studio so she could watch proceedings in comfort, propped up on pillows.The fun was going out of being a Beatle. And, in private, John was now indulging in a far more dangerous kind of fun: heroin. Yoko had tried some at a party and enjoyed it, so he decided to have a go himself.Soon he was hooked. ‘I never injected,’ he’d say. ‘Just sniffing, you know.’ But he rarely did anything he liked by halves, so his denial is questionable.John — who’d always had a callous streak — would speak to Cynthia only once more before the orce. ‘My final offer is £75,000,’ he told the woman he’d once loved to distraction. ‘That’s like winning the pools for you. So, what are you moaning about? You’re not worth any more.’ In the end, they settled for £100,000 (about £1.5 million today).As for Yoko’s husband, Tony Cox, who was caring for their child, John paid him off with £40,000 and despatched him to get a quickie orce in the Virgin Islands. Interestingly, Yoko was less keen than her lover on remarrying. ‘I didn’t like the idea of limiting myself to one man again,’ she said, though she eventually agreed to a low-key wedding in Gibraltar.John was jubilant at having married into the avant-garde intelligentsia. With his new wife, he was no longer just a Beatle: he could take his place as a true ‘artist’ — a word he used constantly in conversations about himself.After all his frenetic years on the road, John, now 28, was going to slow down — ‘because I don’t want to die when I’m 40’.By 1971, John and Yoko had settled in New York.

His first solo album at the time featured songs telling of his love for Yoko"},{"url":null,"title":"Macron branded complete prat calling Leave campaigners liars","story":"    He crowed that it proved the decision to leave was ‘not without costs’ and ‘not without consequences’ at a summit in Salzburg, Austria on Thursday          Others accused Mr Macron of having so much arrogance, he ‘thinks he is Louis XIV’ – the so-called ‘Sun King’ who reigned for 72 years in France during the 17th centuryAnd yesterday Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar appeared to pour more fuel on the fire by claiming Britain was creating all the problems. He said: ‘Ultimately the problems that are being created by Britain and the British Government are being created as a consequence of Brexit and nobody in Europe or Ireland is to blame for that.’Mr Macron had struck the most explosive tone of all EU leaders after emerging from the stormy two-day summit on Thursday.He crowed that it proved the decision to leave was ‘not without costs’ and ‘not without consequences’, adding that Brexit had ‘demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars’. Before the EU referendum, both sides accused each other of dishonesty and continue to do so.Remain supporters point to debatable promises of extra cash pushed by the Leave campaign, including a pledge of an extra £350 million a week to spend on the NHS.Brexiteers point to Project Fear, the name for a collection of terrifying predictions issued by Remainers. In the event, many were shown to be false.Thornberry: Majority of Labour frontbench would vote remain...Share this articleBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab led the fightback against Mr Macron yesterday by insisting Mrs May was ‘the wrong Prime Minister’ to mess with.Others accused Mr Macron of having so much arrogance, he ‘thinks he is Louis XIV’ – the so-called ‘Sun King’ who reigned for 72 years in France during the 17th century.Yesterday Mr Raab told the BBC that Brussels was mistaken if it believed Mrs May could be bounced into giving concessions. He also hit out at what he described as ‘dark mutterings’ in Brussels about Northern Ireland being the ‘price Britain will have to pay’ for leaving.This was in reference to the EU’s demands that Northern Ireland stay tied to the bloc rather than the UK on customs and the single market to avoid a hard border with Ireland after Britain leaves.Mr Raab said: ‘That is not going to happen. Not with this PM, and not with this Parliament.’Brexiteers said Mr Macron’s comments would only serve to strengthen anti-EU feeling and likened it to Barack Obama telling Britain before the referendum it would be at the ‘back of the queue’ on trade if it voted Leave.    British Prime Minister Theresa May looks to passing by heads of government after a photo at the Austria summit on Thursday          Yesterday Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, pictured on Thursday at the EU summit, appeared to pour more fuel on the fire by claiming Britain was creating all the problemsTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It is the classic arrogance of a man who thinks he is Louis XIV. \u0027All he can do is make wild accusations because he does not like the fact that we voted to leave.’Fellow Tory Nigel Evans said: ‘If I was him I’d stick to his domestic priorities and forget trying to belittle the leader of a country which heard the call and did their duty in 1939 to 1945 for France so that he has the freedom to make a complete prat of himself in 2018.’Those on the other side of the Brexit ide were also outraged. Former minister Stephen Crabb said: ‘The manner in which they sought to belittle and put down the Prime Minister yesterday pushes people like me... into a position where we say “the quicker we’re out of this circus, the better”.’          Mr Macron made the gloating comments following a disastrous summit for Theresa May in Salzburg, shown above, where she was ambushed by EU leaders over her Brexit planTory MEP Daniel Hannan added: ‘If Macron thinks that we will respond to insults and bullying, he has badly misread our character and our history.’ Mrs May yesterday said the UK had ‘treated the EU with nothing but respect’, adding: ‘The UK expects the same.’A diplomatic source said: ‘Nobody wants to punish Britain, it’s more that there are good cops and bad cops. France, you could call a bad cop. The Baltics, Netherlands, the ones that traditionally have a good relationship and a lot of trade with the UK – they are the good cops.’The backlash came as it emerged that France’s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, had likened the isions over Brexit to the infamous Dreyfus Affair – the 19th-century spy scandal that dominated French politics for decades.The scandal led to novelist Emile Zola writing an open letter to the French president accusing the government of ‘treason against humanity’ by playing to the public’s anti-Semitism to ert attention away from domestic politics.Mr Rees-Mogg dismissed the comparison as ‘senseless’, while fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Is she trying to somehow say that Brexiteers are anti-foreign or anti-Semitic or something?’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/19/16/5067BF8200000578-0-image-m-38_1537370766106.jpg","title":"Credit Suisse boss dresses woman slammed appearing 100 women list","story":"    The bank director as Philip (right) and as Pippa (left).

She and her younger twin siblings had been left sleeping alone in their beds while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with pals.The Madeleine Fund, officially called Leaving No Stone Unturned, was launched shortly after she went missing. Its sole purpose of to find Maddie, support her family and bring her abductors to justice.A sum of £750,000 is left in the pot which the McCanns will dip into to pay for their own private investigators if the police search is shelved.

He told news website Portugal Resident.com that the couple should explain \u0027how much money they have spent on lawyers\u0027 fees\u0027, adding: \u0027These were thousands of pounds not spent on looking for their daughter.\u0027    The McCanns are still waiting to fund out if Scotland Yard will request extra cash to keep the search for Maddie going when their current funding runs out in just eight daysOver the years money had been flooding into the Fund - which once topped nearly £2million - much it from online sales of merchandise to help the search for Maddie, who would now be aged 15. But Kate recently closed the shop, posting on the Find Maddie website: \u0027Unfortunately, due to many commitments and pressures, I am unable at this time to attend to website orders.

But over the years is has dwindled to a few thousands pounds and now virtually nothing.Kate\u0027s 2011 best-selling book \u0027Madeleine\u0027, with serialisation rights, netted her £1million which she ploughed into the Fund.Together with serialisation deals, it is understood the book — which became a best-seller — has raised nearly £1million for the fund, which has six trustees including Kate and Gerry, both 50.Kate and gerry are now \u0027keeping fingers crossed\u0027 the search for Maddie will carry on for another six monthsTheir pal said: \u0027The funding is down to the Home Office and the police. Kate and Gerry have no say in the matter. They have been here before. They simply have no idea if the search will come to an end or will carry on.

My dad was a teacher in tiny rural primary schools, at first in Herefordshire, close to the Welsh border. Beautiful places that gave me a sense of the romantic, of being an outsider, or at least that I was always an observer looking in. It’s hard to be the headmaster’s kid in a school of 30 pupils, most of whom have grown up together. I remember it as a time of solitary wandering, watching and listening, but perhaps that’s a romantic idea too. I often featured in my own stories.When I was 11 we landed up in north Devon. I’d moved to the grammar school in Barnstaple and for the first time made real friends. Looking back, I remember the summers, family days on the beach, picnics and space. The hit of a good wave as I body-surfed towards the shore. I was never a sporty girl, but I loved the shock of cold, salt water, the magic of swimming in the sea.Later there were teenage parties on the beach, bonfires built below the tideline, too much cheap wine. Our parents must have driven miles over those summers to collect us and see us home safe there was no public transport after dark. In the sixth form I fell in love with another student, a brilliant musician, and I can see him bent over his guitar, caught in the light of the fire and the setting sun. It was the early 70s and we were all hippies at heart.For a while afterwards, nothing lived up to those glorious days. We knew they were special even while they were happening, swore we’d keep in touch. In fact, one of my closest friends does come from that time and when I go to see her, the smell of salt and mud from the Taw transports me back. I’m a girl again in an uncomfortable brown uniform, a heavy satchel weighing me down, walking along the river bank to school. Happy.I never settled at university. It was too big, too anonymous. I felt lost, uncertain, unsophisticated. I dropped out and went to work for Camden social services as a peripatetic childcare officer, looking after kids in their own homes when their parents were temporarily absent through illness or other misfortune. But I was never made in a city or for a city and it wasn’t until I went to Fair Isle in Shetland that I recaptured the contentment of the north Devon years.I arrived in the Isle after several days of storm and a rough trip from Shetland mainland to be assistant cook in the bird observatory. I’d been offered the job after a chance meeting in a pub in Putney and grabbed the chance to escape London. I found a community again: the scientists and domestic staff who worked in the observatory and the islanders who invited me into their homes, fed me and shared their stories. I went back to the Isle quite recently and felt immediately welcome and at home.I met my husband in Fair Isle and we moved around, too. Now north-east England is home and I can’t think of a place I’d rather be. It feels familiar, on the edge, remote from the centre of power. The beaches here are emptier than those on the Devon coast, not quite so pretty perhaps but more dramatic. The sea’s too cold for me to swim, but it doesn’t stop my grandchildren from taking the plunge. The north-east made them.• Ann Cleeves’s Wild Fire is published by Macmillan (£16.99).

Comcast bid at £17.28 per share, substantially more than Fox’s £15.67 offer.The bid has already been greenlit by Sky’s independent directors and shareholders now have until 11 October to decide whether to accept the recommended offer. The takeover process began in December 2016 when Fox tabled a bid to take full control of the London-based satellite broadcaster in a deal valuing the business at £18bn. The proposal then cleared a number of regulatory hurdles in the face of legal challenges and strong parliamentary opposition from Labour politicians including Ed Miliband and the current deputy leader, Tom Watson.In February, Comcast unexpectedly gatecrashed the deal, forcing Murdoch to engage in a costly bidding war that peaked with Comcast’s £26bn bid. Because neither bidder declared their offer to be final, all parties agreed to take part in an auction process to decide the ultimate winner – the first time that such a process has been used in a decade and a rarity for such a large company.Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s group chief executive, said: “As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe’s leading direct to consumer media company.“Today’s outcome is down to the hard work of tens of thousands of people who have built and developed this business together over the last 30 years. Sky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase.”The auction marks a dramatic end for Sky as an independent company. The broadcaster began life in 1989 when Murdoch launched a standalone business offering four channels from an industrial estate in west London. The company was making enormous losses and soon merged with rival British Satellite Broadcasting to form BSkyB. Under Murdoch’s leadership the combined business hit on a winning formula of selling subscriptions on the basis of film and football rights, helping to transform the British media industry and become a highly profitable business.Sky currently serves 26 million customers across Europe and its direct relationship with them is prized in an age when traditional media businesses are concerned about the threat posed by new streaming businesses.Sky has already struck a deal with Netflix to put the service on its set-top boxes and is also celebrating after cutting the amount it pays for Premier League rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02824a4aeb73660e086e5c63704fa1056ded03ad/0_16_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde7f0eb8405f4d90002312d98cc4e68","title":"brexit chequers salzburg irish sea customs union","story":"The rejection of the Chequers plan at Salzburg was no surprise – the EU will never accept a fudge on the Irish borderDonald Tusk’s clear rejection of Theresa May’s Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit yesterday should not come as a surprise. The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously. Given the way things have gone lately for Theresa May’s government we probably shouldn’t rule anything out, but let’s just assume the Tokyo audience he addressed in their native tongue this week wasn’t just being polite and that he did actually deliver the whole speech in the correct language.Lately there has been some tinkering with grade boundaries to encourage uptake. But while mathematicians and scientists have gone to great lengths to popularise subjects once seen as geeky or intimidatingly difficult, there has been no concerted push behind French or Spanish.And if we’re honest, Britain’s solid international reputation for being rubbish at languages isn’t just down to the kids. How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers.

So here we go.I recently received an email from a publicist asking if I would like to meet to talk about his clients. I often get these requests, but this was different: I knew the publicist.When I was 18, he was one of my university lecturers. It was just silly things at first: staring at me, touching me under the slimmest of pretexts. At a loss as to how to respond, I did nothing. This was apparently taken as encouragement, and the touches became notes asking for dates. Not daily notes. But more than a teacher should give to a student, which is any number from one upwards.I knew this was not a big deal – I’d watched the Anita Hill hearings, I knew what real sexual harassment was. And yet I couldn’t see how to get out of this without risking either my grades or his career. I worried about him. Maybe he, the teacher, didn’t know the rules the way I, a teenager, did.In the end, nothing happened. The course finished, he moved on and so did I. But I occasionally thought how embarrassed he must be now. Pestering a student for dates! He must feel so bad.But apparently not. His breezy email said that he remembered me as “a sparky student”. He had “greatly enjoyed our encounters”. Really, we must do lunch. And I realised something then that should have been obvious to me all along, which was that he didn’t feel bad now, because he didn’t feel bad then.It’s almost a year since Harvey Weinstein was first publicly accused of harassment and rape (charges he denies), kicking off the #MeToo movement that was supposed to change gender relations for ever. Various US publications have inadvertently marked this anniversary by publishing plaintive personal essays – not by the victims of sexual harassment, but by the accused themselves.In the New York Review of Books (NYRB), the former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi writes that he’d always been a good guy – he interviewed Gloria Steinem! – but success had made him a “lothario”. This, I guess, is the new name for someone accused of harassment or assault by multiple women. Up to 20 women have accused Ghomeshi of slapping, punching, biting, choking or smothering none complained of him being a “lothario”. In 2016, he was acquitted of four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking, relating to three women. Another charge was dropped after Ghomeshi apologised for “sexually inappropriate” behaviour. He denies all the allegations.The Fall Of Men is the NYRB’s coverline, although men don’t seem to have fallen so far that they won’t get commissioned to write 3,500 words about how great they are. In Harpers magazine, the American journalist John Hockenberry, who was accused of sexual harassment and bullying, has written a 7,000-word article in which he claims he is merely guilty of “being a misguided romantic”. In the article, he admits propositioning colleagues, but denies coercion or bullying. He also complains that “only one of my accusers reached out”, as though it were their job to stop him feeling bad. Rarely have the limitations of a personal essay – as opposed to an interview – been more exposed: claims go unchallenged, inconvenient details are omitted.Rest assured, Ian: we are. Almost as soon as these men left the stage, people have been discussing how quickly they could return. (Ironically, Buruma himself has now stepped down as editor, saying he has been ‘publicly pilloried’, aka held to account.) As a “lawyer close to the White House” said this week, in response to the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh (which he denies), “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man should be worried. We can all be accused of something.” Look what you’ve done, women: you’ve made men feel bad. (Or maybe not that bad: Louis CK has already returned to standup.)Imagine the narcissism required to be told, by multiple women, how bad you made them feel, and respond with: “I should now write about me.” It takes more than a hashtag to break that kind of entitlement. So while #MeToo has made some men re-examine their behaviour, plenty of others who thought their behaviour was fine before clearly still think it is fine now.The storyline should not be about male redemption, or men’s feelings. So I wrote back to my former lecturer and told him I did not want lunch and, in fact, I did not want to see him at all, ever. Because it is not my responsibility to make sure he’s OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e434cede6abf2d020c00f4261640476f6f188a9a/0_79_3692_2215/master/3692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f51aa61953efc3a0111e1de936019ee","title":"in todays britain compromise is spurned in a bid for brutal victories","story":"Politics before the crash was based on the understanding that you couldn’t have it all. The free-market right had won the economic war, ran the cliche of the time, while the left had won the culture war. Centre-left governments were “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich”, said Peter Mandelson, “as long as they pay their taxes”. Not only leftish politicians, however, but many on the centre-right were not remotely relaxed about racism, sexism and homophobia. On these issues at least, cultural conservatives, as we so euphemistically call them, had to accept that the world had changed.Now Britain is a country where political movements believe they need not accept any limits on their ambitions. They do not just want to beat their opponents – they want to crush them. They do not just want to win – they yearn for the religious ecstasy of victories achieved without compromise. It is barely noticed that centrists are just as likely as the extremists of the Brexit right and far left to turn into Cosmo girls and demand to have it all. The people’s vote movement believes, with ample reason, that the Leave campaign was a confederacy of charlatans that sold the public a pack of lies. Reasonably and patriotically, it is trying to protect the country by reversing the damage. It is not a criticism of an idea with which I have every sympathy to say that it has turned away from compromise.After the referendum, there was talk of making the best of Brexit by campaigning to keep Britain in the single market and customs union. It would protect living standards and maintain peace in Ireland, while accepting some EU laws and freedom of movement in return.The “Norway option” is what compromises are meant to be: a deal that fully satisfies no one. It might have won over tepid supporters of Leave, who were not prepared to have their futures sacrificed on the altar of British nationalism.Norway vanished into the Scandinavian mists months ago. When journalists talk to anti-Brexit campaigners, they say the choice in a second referendum should be between May’s deal with the EU (assuming she can escape from the Tories’ make-believe world for long enough to cut one), crashing out with no deal and staying in. The barely concealed desire is that Remainers will win second time around without the need to make concessions to the 17 million who voted Leave. The barely understood danger is that a significant section of the electorate will revolt against what they see as a rigging of the system and vote accordingly.Only the imperiousness of a Tory right, whose ambition has left it unhinged, allows Remainers to dream of a rematch. You may not like to admit it but Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are British liberalism’s last best hopes. If their zealotry ensures nothing gets through the Commons, then the case for a second referendum goes from being the wishful thinking of the defeated to a plausible strategy.Self-interest should make the right compromise. Before 2016, Nigel Farage, Daniel Hannan and the rest of the Brexit gang were happy to accept that, in the words of Russia’s favourite British oligarch, Arron Banks, “the Norway option looks the best for the UK”. Now the chance of a complete break with the continent leaves them giddy. They want everything: no customs union, no single market, no role for the European court of justice, no co-operation with any institution with the satanic mark of Europe upon it. They are terrified that, if they moderate their demands, “the establishment” will snatch away their one chance to live the fantasy of recreating the glorious isolation of Victorian Britain in the 21st century.The same mixture of elation and paranoia powers the far left. Any candid friend should be able to tell Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters that they risk losing an election if they purge Labour of heretics. A McCarthyism of the left will drive away centrist voters, and all but compel dissidents to create a new party. If any friends are speaking uncomfortable truths, the far left isn’t listening. The Labour conference will be dominated by procedural trickery to extend the far left’s control of the party rather than such trivial matters as – oh, I don’t know – the future of the country. Like the Brexiters, like Trump, like so many others who have triumphed when received wisdom said they would fail, Corbyn is high on the vanity unexpected success generates.“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given,” said St Matthew. “But whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.” He might have been describing modern Britain, where all sides believe the winner should take it all. Their voracity stems from the collapse of the received wisdom of the boom years. As it turned out, the free-market right did not win the economic war. Commentators, who still condemn or praise “neo-liberalism”, do not understand that it died a decade ago when governments had to provide fantastic sums to save the banking system. Globally, countries are moving towards protectionism and state capitalism.As for the left’s victory in the culture war, the new right finds it easier to win elections on the cultural battlefield than by making economic promises electorates stopped believing years ago. Meanwhile, the supposedly triumphant cultural left thought in its complacency it could ban rivals, rather than beat them in argument and had no coherent response to the revival of nationalism and white backlash politics in Europe and the US.In these circumstances, everything can appear up for grabs: the economy, culture, sovereignty and national identity. With so much at stake, it is no wonder politicians and their acolytes are greedy. Let us hope they overreach themselves. Settlements reached by compromise may not satisfy absolutists but they tend to last because all sides have a stake in them. Turn your opponents into enemies, humiliate and abuse them and, when you slip, they will take their revenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0292ca86dc86f5dcba4cd70acf2097eb66f739/0_21_2220_1332/master/2220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd9e27dccac7ada0e4b628f74d565bf4","title":"kanye west followers galore social medias unlikely critic","story":"The American rapper is raising essential points about how we intereact with sites such as TwitterKanye West has tweeted a series of thoughts on social media and self-esteem, along with a screen grab of a conversation with Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, who agrees that it’s time to change a system that no longer works as it should or once did. “Social media can be good but we have to hold the heads responsible for the psychological damage it sometimes causes,” wrote West, linking to a video, posted to Instagram, of Denzel Washington saying that young people should turn off social media.Perhaps as a test run for his promised 2024 US presidential bid, instead of simply observing the problem, West offered a solution: “We should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have. Just like how we can turn off the comments, we should be able to turn off the display of followers. This has an intense negative impact on our self-worth.” You could view that as someone with more than 28 million followers realising that it’s hard to have a proper conversation over a cacophony of bots, bros and snowflakes, but it sounds like the start of a sensible and practical discussion about change.In the text conversation with West, Dorsey set out what Twitter should be aiming for. He said that the need for more followers skewed people’s incentives for tweeting. Certainly, it has made the public conversation more crude and more polarised and shown the potentially catastrophic effects of oversimplification. “We want to incentivise contribution to the global conversation and consciousness,” Dorsey explained. The idea that metrics be removed is a radical one, particularly if we take away all markers of impact and scale. It would replace pandering to an audience with a guessing game as to who’s listening: essentially, we’d all be shouting into the void, unsure of whether anyone is there or not. Would that produce some kind of Black Mirror hellhole or would it be a comparative utopia?There are more and more reports of our growing lack of contentment and last week the Girlguiding organisation published a survey stating that the happiness of girls and young women is in sharp decline, in part, it is suggested, because they are outside less and online more. Life online, in its current state, is chipping away at everyone’s self-worth and the need for change is becoming urgent, wherever that change may come from.TV’s current blockbuster period is producing so many huge dramas that the only way to keep up is to give up work and social commitments and lock oneself in the house with an infinite supply of energy drinks. Still, with Toni Collette working through polyamory in Wanderlust, Hugo Blick holding the international criminal court to account with Black Earth Rising and a stream of boundary-pushing Netflix and Amazon Emmy winners, there’s still one non-drama that makes it into the must-sees: Gogglebox.Even now, in its 12th series, Gogglebox is essential viewing. It allows viewers to cram in everything they didn’t have time to see without resorting to drastic isolation measures I watched pretty much all of Doctor Foster and Marcella through Gogglebox, which was far more time-efficient than ing into the actual series. It’s also a weekly snapshot of the state of Britain, with a look at what people from all over the country, from all walks of life, think about what’s going on.My favourite Goggleboxers shift from week to week, but the greatest of all were Leon and June Bernicoff, who were kind, funny and furiously indignant about the country under the Tories. Leon died aged 83 last December last year and June decided not to be on the show without him. I miss them both. On Friday, June appeared on This Morning to give a gorgeous interview about Leon and the book she’s written about their life together, which ned six decades. “Quite honestly,” she said, “I can’t imagine life without him.” At that point, I must have got something in my eye.The rapper and singer Lady Leshurr has appeared as the “first pansexual cover star” of Gay Times magazine. In the accompanying interview, she talks about being outed on Twitter and how she was advised by an ex-manager that coming out wouldn’t be “a good look” for her career. “Representation is really, really important because there’s only a minority of us,” she said. “I don’t know anybody else that’s black, British and gay that really came out in the music industry and is wearing it proud except me and MNEK.”It’s a point that MNEK has been making recently, too, telling Nihal Arthanayake on Radio 5 Live about how fans relate to him, as a gay man and a person of colour. “As I was figuring stuff out for this record, I didn’t always see someone that I could relate to, that would tell me that being black and gay is OK,” he said. “This is where I’m at and this is gonna help someone else figure their stuff out. It gives my career a lot more purpose than just making songs.”It’s an elegant reminder of something that is too often taken as a given: that we need to see ourselves in others and that representation really does matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0765bddabae1f34a6f3e9b7f7ad520580d08d8bd/0_0_4898_3047/master/4898.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=170fcb2973557ef4affba6e321b5c0fe 1880w","title":"henry viii tent field of cloth of gold reconstruction","story":"A spectacular temporary palace designed to impress the king of France is to be reconstructed at Hampton CourtTudor monarchs did not travel light. Vast tents – with great halls and multiple chambers, sumptuous furniture and fabrics of gold and velvet – used to accompany them on their journeys to far-flung areas of the realm, and even to battlefields. But not a single remnant of these extraordinary displays of wealth and power has survived, and little, if any, research has been done on their design.Now Historic Royal Palaces (HRP) has launched an ambitious project to reconstruct a huge section of one of Henry VIII’s tents, an edifice whose spectacular appearance is hinted at by a surviving design in the British Library. Covered in exquisite red cloth, it is decorated with Tudor roses and has tent poles topped by “king’s beasts”, including heraldic antelopes.Charles Farris, a research associate on the project, entitled Portable Palaces: Royal Tents and Timber Lodgings 1509-1603 and supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, said the reconstruction would explore how multi-compartmental tents were put together.In the grounds of Hampton Court Palace – Henry VIII’s seat of power – a large rectangular tent, measuring 15 metres by six, will be attached to a circular tent about five metres in diameter, with a conical roof. That, in turn, will be connected by a corridor tent 3.5 metres long by 2.5 metres wide.Alden Gregory, architectural historian and the HRP curator of historic buildings, told the Observer: “My background is in researching great palaces and elite houses in this period, the early 16th century, but there’s a real gap in our knowledge about these temporary structures.”The research project has set out to discover the architectural significance of these portable palaces, including how they were made, transported, dismantled and regularly re-erected.HRP, which oversees six historic palaces, is helping with preparations for the 500th anniversary of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, the meeting that took place outside Calais in 1520 between Henry VIII and François I of France. A famous contemporary painting depicts that meeting, with the great golden tents from which it took its name featured in the background.Both kings competed to outdo the other with the opulence of their tents, as well as feasts and jousting. At that time the White Tower at the Tower of London was the tallest building in London, yet one of the French tents was even taller – made of canvas covered with cloth of gold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02922f4f1970daaf6238d8e3335b6429766c39a8/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e455374342b9439af875a2bed32603f","title":"eight of the best coastal walks in wales","story":"Whether you fancy a stroll with fabulous sea views or a long-distance hike past a medieval castle, you’ll find it all on the coast of WalesThe Welsh coastline has been described as one of the best places on Earth to visit, and it’s not hard to see why. From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

Well, regular in one sense but not in another given it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity it is easy to forget they are 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6ad7a2e9076fc115c8c00d3d0b2ccb60ea4d0a/0_97_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=067ce9f9560dadcb3a6d599dbd4f2936","title":"brighton tottenham premier league match report","story":"There are times when any win will do and, for Tottenham, this was certainly one. The vultures had been circling after three defeats and the historians leafing all the way back to the spring of 2004, the last time they lost four consecutive games in a single season. Mauricio Pochettino needed his players to stand tall at what has become one of the Premier League’s more testing venues for the bigger clubs they did that and, while this performance fell some way short of their fluent best, a few suggestions of a return to form flickered, too.Foremost among them was their second, ultimately decisive goal, scored by Érik Lamela after the kind of rapier-like attack Tottenham have made their trademark under Pochettino. Lamela had replaced Son Heung-min eight minutes before taking possession just inside the Brighton half and, via Lucas Moura, working the ball to Danny Rose. He kept running and was rewarded with an accurate cutback that, without breaking stride, he swept beyond Mat Ryan.“That is how we want to play, how we feel football,” Pochettino said of the goal’s construction, although Spurs showed another side that made him even happier. He had pointedly questioned their resolve after Tuesday’s late capitulation at Internazionale and here, amid filthy conditions against a team that had taken 10 points from their previous four home games against last season’s top six, they faced down the kind of challenge tailor-made for anyone curious about their response.They were slightly lucky that Glenn Murray, needlessly handballing Kieran Trippier’s free-kick, gave Harry Kane the chance to dispel the cobwebs that had gathered during an increasingly ponderous first half. They were fortunate, too, that Anthony Knockaert shot straight at Paulo Gazzaniga in the 66th minute when he should have equalised. There was even an improbable wobble at the end after Knockaert, a mite too late in proceedings, got his bearings right with an excellent finish.But Pochettino saw enough to feel Tottenham had recovered something that, even if only for three weeks, had been lost.“I think the spirit we showed today is the spirit I wanted to see in all the games,” he said. “The team was fantastic in how it defended this mentality to fight and always give your best. That’s what pleased me the most today.”Tottenham began authoritatively and might have taken the lead when Toby Alderweireld, meeting Trippier’s corner with a thudding header that flicked off Gaëten Bong, drew a flying one-handed save from Ryan. Both players had been recalled after missing the game at San Siro for what Pochettino had termed “technical reasons” Trippier was heavily involved early on but, after that initial encouragement, their tempo slowed and the doubts set back in.Then Murray, jumping in the wall and repelling the ball with his arm when the adjacent Davy Pröpper had been poised to take one in the face for his team, opened the door for Tottenham and Kane beat Ryan confidently from the spot. The home crowd howled with derision in reality there was no disputing Christopher Kavanagh’s call, although Chris Hughton felt the award of the free-kick itself had been soft.Hughton also felt Brighton should have had their own penalty in the second half when Eric Dier appeared to have grabbed Lewis Dunk’s shirt. But the bigger frustration was that, during a ferocious spell of pressure, Knockaert fired straight at Gazzaniga after doing the hard work by cutting inside Jan Vertonghen. In a frantic period of added time Knockaert scored, watched Ryan save a one-on-one from Kane, and drew another stop from the keeper with the last action of the game. A foot to his right and, suddenly, those proclamations about Spurs’ resolve would have looked far weaker.“For me he was man of the match,” Pochettino said of Gazzaniga. “He was fantastic – his personality and his character.” Those were the facets he had sought above all and, with some bumps along the way, they were exactly what he was given."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b475a59508abf2d03814fa186e9f3e6b1cb78c63/0_117_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9b0f39b20cf26adea71dd1eca3041b0","title":"liverpool southampton premier league match report","story":"As Jürgen Klopp is fond of telling, it takes greed, aggression, talent and a phenomenal work-rate to succeed on his terms yet Liverpool are making the hard art of victory look routine. The Premier League summit was reclaimed with ease against Southampton, a seventh straight win stretching a flawless start as well as the idea that healthy competition exists between the best and the rest.Liverpool ended the contest before half-time as a Wesley Hoedt own goal, Joël Matip header and Mohamed Salah tap-in brought an emphatic interval lead over Mark Hughes’ visitors. If Charity Shield results are included, this is now the finest start to a campaign in Liverpool’s illustrious history. They are raking up wins while in second gear, have kept eight consecutive clean sheets at home in the Premier League and have two points more than Manchester City did at the corresponding stage of last season. Not that anyone at Anfield is looking too far ahead, of course.“I once lost seven games in a row and that felt much different,” said Klopp. “Yes, it is a surprise but the performances we showed so far were good enough to win all the games. Different styles and different opponents but the boys were always there.”Liverpool’s formation was even more adventurous than usual with Xherdan Shaqiri handed his first start in a floating role behind Salah, who was deployed as the central striker with Roberto Firmino left and Sadio Mané right. The summer signing was given only 45 minutes to impress against his former Stoke City manager. It was enough. Shaqiri instigated the breakthrough when he collected Mané’s piercing pass following a corner, cut inside Cédric Soares and shot for goal. It would have sailed wide but for a deflection off Shane Long which erted the ball on to Hoedt’s thigh and in.Klopp’s changed system – worked on for only one rain-interrupted training session on Friday – offered Southampton space to attack Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson in numbers. It was an invitation the visitors accepted regularly but the absence of Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, and the commanding presence of Virgil van Dijk ensured there was no end product. Van Dijk would exit in the second half with a rib injury that Klopp described as “not cool but not too serious”. His replacement, Joe Gomez, was equally impressive. Southampton paid a high price for the absence of any such authority in the heart of their defence.Liverpool doubled their lead from another corner, conceded by Soares’ superb challenge on Salah as he shaped to convert Firmino’s return pass. Alexander-Arnold swept the delivery deep and Matip towered above Jannik Vestergaard to head his first Anfield goal into Alex McCarthy’s top corner.The game provided a further demonstration of the widening gulf between the Premier League’s leading lights and their supposed competitors. Southampton did not play particularly badly and Liverpool were a long way short of their intensive, dominant best yet they still strolled off at half-time three goals to the good. “It would seem so,” said Hughes when asked if the gap was growing. “I’d like to think that, on our day, we can give the best teams a good go. Hopefully we will prove that along the way but you have to acknowledge that Liverpool have a settled way of playing, personnel who have been here a long time and a manager who has been here a long time as well. They are clearly building something here.”Number three was a simple but important tap-in for Salah. Klopp had played down concerns over the Egypt international’s form ahead of the game but, evidently, the source of 44 goals last season has not yet recaptured his sharpness. Salah went close several times, with one audacious backheel beating McCarthy but trickling agonisingly wide of the far post, before reacting more quickly than anyone to convert from close range after Shaqiri had struck the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards.Shaqiri was replaced by James Milner at half-time as Klopp reverted to his trusted 4-3-3 formation and Liverpool coasted. “I told him I’d never substituted such an influential player at half-time before who wasn’t injured,” said Klopp.The second half was flat by comparison although the watching Jeremy Corbyn, in the city for the Labour party conference and having paid his respects at the Hillsborough memorial before kick-off, can only have been impressed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477fde9925973504a33634200d5a0610f3e558fa/0_193_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c7029ff7012707cbdcde32a6af99164","title":"manchester united wolves premier league match report","story":"Sir Alex Ferguson was back where he belongs – at Old Trafford – for the first time since recovering from a brain haemorrhage but he witnessed a disappointing draw for a Manchester United team who failed to turn dominance into three points. At the close Wolves came close to stealing victory when David de Gea saved a shot from Adama Traoré with a foot and the winger then blasted wide in added time.This left José Mourinho again bewailing his players’ mindset, stating those of Wolves possessed a “World Cup final” attitude and his did not. “They play like I like to play, which is like the World Cup final,” the manager said. “That is the attitude I like my teams to have in every match. We didn’t have that. This is something you learn when you are a kid in the academy. You don’t need experiences at the highest level to learn that. It is a basic law of football.“I can’t explain the difference of attitude because I never had a difference of attitude. For me it is difficult to explain that.”The visitors signalled early on they would push forward when possible, creating two chances for Raúl Jiménez, the attacking spearhead in Nuno Espírito Santo’s 5-4-1 set-up. Both times United were breached along Luke Shaw’s left corridor but Jiménez failed to take full advantage. He miscued the first and De Gea saved smartly from the second.Mourinho paired Victor Lindelöf and Chris Smalling in central defence for a fourth successive game and Alexis Sánchez replaced Anthony Martial on the left. In all there were four changes by United’s manager. By contrast his Portuguese compatriot fielded the same XI he has for all Wolves’ league matches this season.Mourinho’s faith in the Smalling-Lindelöf combination was hardly repaid by what occurred from two João Moutinho corners. When he floated the first over from the right, Ryan Bennett headed over. Then, moments later, Willy Boly forced a superb De Gea save with neither centre-back anywhere near.It was reflective of how United were pinned back in virtually all of the opening passages. Yet after 20 minutes they were in the lead.Shaw wandered forward, close to Wolves’ area and pinged in a cross. Eventually the ball fell to Paul Pogba and he continued his fine form from midweek with a cute reverse-flick to Fred, whose weak right-foot shot beat Rui Patrício.Sánchez continues to struggle for consistency but Ferguson would have approved of how he drove along the left and flipped a clever ball in toward the galloping Pogba and Romelu Lukaku as half-time neared.On the touchline Espírito Santo was a frustrated man due to some of the decisions awarded against Wolves and, when Patrício dawdled and had to hoof the ball out as Jesse Lingard closed in, his frustration turned to fury.United began the second half with a raking Pogba pass that Lukaku controlled expertly with a knee and for a moment Patrício’s goal looked threatened but the centre-forward’s shot was blocked.It was a sign of the home side’s ascendancy, though too often they ceded the ball via clumsy touches, with Fred a chief culprit. This failing led to the visitors’ equaliser, although it was Pogba to blame.The Frenchman attempted a fancy turn near halfway and lost the ball to Rúben Neves as the onlooking Mourinho reacted with concern, knowing what might now happen. It did: when Wolves tore forward, Jiménez passed the ball back inside United’s area to Moutinho, who smacked the ball home.Mourinho’s reaction was to remove Fred and the ineffective Sánchez for Juan Mata and Martial on 62 minutes. Martial combined with Shaw for the latter to swing in a far-post cross from which Fellaini should have beaten Patrício. Instead the ball was erted into the goalkeeper’s hands.Mourinho’s last throw of the dice was the removal of Lingard for Andreas Pereira. The midfielder won a free-kick in a central area, 30 yards out, but it came to nothing and United’s run of victories ended.“I am proud of the way we played,” said Espírito Santo. Meanwhile United are already eight points behind the leaders, Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fa605a8ed2701ce5cc3e2989e7c15f8a528d1c0/0_374_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9a7f810c92e77ee10e42ff421837672","title":"how to create new plants for free","story":"It’s free and easy. Here’s howIt is a simple, but magical, act: take a little bit of stem and, with a few careful cuts, create a new plant. That magic, the ebb and flow of hormones and auxins, is on your side: once severed of its root, the plant is desperate to take hold again. All you have to do is give it a go. Right now, the window for semi-ripe cuttings is drawing to a close, but it is not shut: this weekend, for 15 minutes’ worth of effort, you can take those tired lavenders that have become leggy, or that woody rosemary, and strike a few cuttings so you have new plants for spring for free. Hyssop, thyme, bay, sage, lemon verbena, rue, scented pelargoniums, penstemons and verbenas are suitable for semi-ripe cuttings.These cuttings are taken from sections of stems of this year’s growth. Ideally, these sections should not be flowering and they need to be woody or firm at the base and soft at the tip. You are after the middle section, which is “ripe” for striking roots. You will need secateurs or a knife, some seed compost with a little extra grit or perlite for drainage, a plastic pot and a clear plastic bag. You will also need a warm, light windowsill on which to put the cuttings, or a greenhouse – either way, they must be kept out of direct sunlight.Once the stem loses contact with the roots, it starts a rapid process of wilting, so cuttings should be taken in the morning or evening, but never in midday sun. If possible, you should either plunge the cuttings straight into cool water or put them in a clear plastic bag, sealed shut to retain humidity. Kept cool, cuttings can be stored for 12 hours this way.Your knife or secateurs need to be very sharp and clean– this is surgery, not a hack job. Take cuttings that are 10-15cm long, cutting just below a leaf node (where the leaf appears from the stem).Next, remove the lowest set of leaves, as well as the soft tip. There should be about four leaves remaining. Insert the cuttings into the compost to just below the lowest set of remaining leaves and cover with a clear plastic bag, so they stay moist. Keep the compost damp, but remove excess moisture, if necessary too much, and you will get mould. You will know the plant is rooting well when you see new leaves appearing. When this happens, remove the plastic bag. You can pot up once the roots start poking out of the drainage holes. You will have to keep the cuttings somewhere sheltered and frost-free over winter a cold frame is ideal, even if it is just fashioned out of some bricks and glass by the back of the house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba29997bbb653452b0f3c4535da008541fb2ac91/0_408_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2782f07c16f446015ff2f923c233046","title":"time magazine historic iconic covers","story":"Meredith recently announced that it was selling Time magazine for $190m in cash to Marc Benioff, one of four co-founders of Salesforce, and his wife Lynne.

At the same time, efforts are under way to eliminate tampon tax and taboos around menstruationFrom the time we’re old enough to get our periods, girls can be made to feel ashamed of them. Everyone who sat in a classroom through those strange, secretive years will remember the absolute horror and dread of being caught short or having to ask a teacher for menstrual products. We learn not only to come prepared but to be silent about what’s going on too. It’s second nature for us to conceal the very fact that we have periods at all – hiding tampons and pads on the way to the bathroom, stuffed into pencil cases, bras, sleeves.If it was difficult for those of us fortunate enough to always have these products to hand, it’s shocking to consider the girls among us who are forced by poverty to go without them entirely. Several years ago the concept of period poverty began to rise in public consciousness in the UK. The Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, a harrowing account of the realities of poverty in modern Britain, sent awareness of this particular struggle soaring. After its release, food bank managers around England reported that a scene in which a young woman named Katie is forced to shoplift pads sent toiletry donations skyrocketing.Of course, the problem isn’t confined to menstruation when an inidual or a family is living in poverty, it can mean they are forced to choose between eating enough or keeping the lights on and buying all sorts of hygiene essentials. A report by In Kind Direct – an organisation that receives donations from consumer goods companies and distributes them to charities – lists toothpaste, nappies, tampons, razors, deodorant and shampoo as items that had to be foregone by people living in poverty. It is vital that all of these essentials make their way to donation banks. But perhaps one reason that period poverty has especially caught public attention in the past two years is the particular problem of teenage girls, already at economic and social disadvantage, missing out on their education needlessly.Amika George, the teenage campaigner who started the #FreePeriods campaign, became engaged with the issue when she read an article about schoolgirls in Leeds who had been truant on the days of their periods. Concerned teachers had contacted Freedom4Girls, a charity established to provide sanitary products to Kenyan girls and women. Shocked that in modern Britain there were girls forced to choose between missing school and using unsafe alternatives such as socks, toilet paper and rags, George set to work.“I started a petition to call on the government to provide free menstrual products to girls from low-income families, and decided to spread the word and talk unashamedly, not just about period poverty but about menstruation!” she said in an interview with Vogue last year. More shocking to George, and many others, than the problem itself was the fact that nothing was being done about it by the government. Indeed, the fact that sanitary products are taxed as a luxury product means their prices are kept even higher than necessary, blocking more girls from accessing them.At the same time, girlguiding became much more menstruation-positive, with the introduction of a period poverty badge. Guides will be encouraged to discuss this as a social issue, support fundraising for donations, and explore how they feel personally about periods. An activity-led programme of education includes items such as role play of a scenario in which you’ve had a period leak while not at home. Doireann Larkin, the development manager of Tender, a charity that uses drama and the arts to help young people understand healthy relationships, fully supports the initiative: “We need to provide every opportunity for girls to feel confident and secure in school. By failing to address period poverty, we’re denying some girls the chance to focus and participate fully in class and increasing the disadvantage they might already be facing.”Guides will be able to get badges that are decorated with pictures of tampons, pads and menstrual cups, a fact that seems especially encouraging given how previous generations have been taught to hide such images. It’s a strange fact that, until recently, advertising for menstruation products would rarely show the actual product, using isolated fabric samples instead.The Homeless Period Project (HPP) addresses those already at their most vulnerable. While we may understand how desperate a homeless woman’s situation is, we rarely consider the logistical nightmare of menstruating without shelter and access to products. Local chapters of HPP set up their own fundraisers to donate to local shelters.These frontline activists and organisations are crucial. But so too is dismantling the taboo that exists behind all the secrecy and shame. We have to move on from the medieval idea that periods are dirty or not to be spoken of. That’s why young campaigners such as Grace F Victory are so important – she recently collaborated with the Always #EndPeriodPoverty campaign, which has seen the brand donate more than 5m pads directly to schools, a figure that’s estimated to rise to more than 10m donations by the end of the year. After her Instagram post of herself with a menstrual leak lost her hundreds of followers, she spoke out against them. Embarrassment is bad enough in and of itself, but when an inevitable bit of our biology causes us to miss out on daily life, there’s even more need to overcome it. We simply can’t accept that vulnerable young women are being blocked from their education.This is why ending period poverty needs to include taboo busting at its core. We can’t offer help to people too ashamed to ask for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/7_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df7227ce8218f8f51f310de83d6377b","title":"european press no more forgiving than british over salzburg summit theresa may","story":"If she was hoping for a small crumb of comfort after what the vast majority of the British media saw as a “humiliating” and “disastrous” Salzburg summit, Theresa May did not find it in the pages of the European press.Coverage of the meeting, at which May was bluntly informed that the core components of her Chequers plan “will not work”, was generally focused as much, if not more, on the EU’s disagreements over migration policy as it was on Brexit.But the conclusion of the continental media, few of which made events in Salzburg their top story, was that the prime minister’s predicament was wholly predictable – the EU’s view of Chequers has been known since it was published, many pointed out – and entirely her problem. Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"PM gives combative speech after rejection of Chequers plan, stoking ‘no deal’ fearsTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect in a deliberately combative address that prompted a sharp fall in the pound amid fears that it made a no deal Brexit more likely.Twenty-four hours after her Salzburg humiliation, the prime minister gave a hastily arranged televised Downing Street statement in an effort to reassert herself.Speaking from a lectern with two union flags behind her, May tried to accuse her counterparts of bad faith: “I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.

A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.”Her remarks came a day after the Salzburg summit where EU leaders frustrated by May’s insistence on sticking rigidly to her controversial Chequers negotiating plan embarrassed her when the EU council president, Donald Tusk, unexpectedly declared it “would not work”.May retaliated on Friday: “Yesterday, Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.” She called on the EU to spell out “what their alternative is”.But Tusk, the European council president, hit back hard at the prime minister, accusing her of bringing a “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” attitude to the Salzburg summit. He denied May’s claims that the EU had failed to explain its position to the British negotiators, claiming to have spelled out the problems in detail in recent weeks, although he insisted that “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Despite the heated rhetoric and plunge in sterling, EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to the Chequers plan, which is likely to appear in early October, after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make or break Brexit summit in Brussels.No 10 is calculating May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, or risk facing hostile activists at the party’s annual conference in just over a week.Several cabinet ministers put out statements of support. Penny Mourdant, the international development secretary, again emphasised the possibility of a no deal, saying that while voters “still want a deal” they would be “content to go without one, even folk who voted remain”.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a failure and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers. “There is still no reason to suppose that Chequers can work either for the UK or the EU.”Chequers proposes that the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border, a plan so unpopular on the right of the Tory party that Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned rather than support it.That would imply the UK would have to align itself more broadly to EU rules after Brexit to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland, a proposal that could be difficult for May to sell to her party.Hard Brexiters will step up their campaign against Chequers in the run up to the Tory party conference on Monday. D Davis and other senior rightwing politicians are expected to attend an event at which alternative “Canada plus” trade proposals will be announced.The EU, however, has said that while it would be prepared to discuss a Canada-style deal, that would mean not just taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, it would also mean the return of border controls in Ireland.The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal that would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK was unable to agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgment it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In a rare direct criticism of a serving prime minister, Tusk made reference to the criticisms of Michel Barnier by the British government, and the refusal of the British side to work on a solution to the Irish border issue by October, as previously promised.“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising”, he said. “The response of the EU27 leaders was to reiterate our trust in chief negotiator Michel Barnier and to reiterate our position on the integrity of the single market and the Irish backstop.But he added: “While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the EU: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b33fca5ed5ab28e045eae91ac4309dc4bc2580/0_94_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6bd91d3abe681b07c9dcc4904710a3d","title":"call for free trade brexit no deal stephen hammond","story":"The prime minister showed a new face on Friday when she delivered her statement after the “impasse” in Salzburg. She suddenly became “Tough Talking Theresa”, condemning the EU for not agreeing to her Chequers plan and demanding respect.She again said it was her plan or no deal. It is clear that a no-deal Brexit is now a real possibility, with all the potential calamitous repercussions that would entail for our economy, our security and much else we currently take for granted.And what of the Chequers plan? A negotiated settlement could still be achieved and parts of it, such as a common rule book, are still alive. As Theresa May acknowledged, negotiation is about talking and compromise. The UK should re-commit to this, as the prize of a close long-term economic relationship post-Brexit is enormous for both Britain and the EU.I hope the prime minister will accept the challenge of history, break the impasse and deliver a negotiated settlement.However, any solution will need to pass through the complex arithmetic in the House of Commons – and while the Chequers plan faces significant opposition, it is also clear that there would be no majority for a so-called no-dealWorld Trade Organisation Brexit.EftaEEA is an off-the-shelf model that has already been tested. It would allow the UK to remain in most parts of the single market but be removed from the more controversial parts of EU membership, such as the pursuit of an ever-closer union and the common justice and home affairs policies. It would be a return to the common market principles that Margaret Thatcher advocated when the UK led the creation of the single market.The critics of Efta erroneously say that EU immigration rules are the same for EftaEEA countries. This is not true. The EEA agreement is predicated on the free movement of workers and strengthening trade, not the concept of EU citizenship. Also, articles 112 and 113 of the EEA agreement can be used as an emergency brake on immigration.It is often stated that Britain would remain in the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) but, again, this is simply false. For Efta countries, the EEA agreement is upheld by the separate Efta court, which can erge from the ECJ, and has done so if necessary.Finally there is the much-repeated but inaccurate claim that Efta countries are rule-takers rather than rule-makers. However, the rules in question are those that our exporters will need to comply with to trade with the EEA or the EU. Moreover, we are going to have to accept some international standards or devise our own if we want to sign all these promised new trade deals.Efta member states have the right to participate in expert groups and committees of the European commission, to submit comments on upcoming EU legislation, and have a “right of reservation” to block any EEA law. They follow the rules, yes, but they also get a say in them.The search for a future relationship with the EU that protects our economy and prevents a hard border in Ireland continues. If a negotiated settlement cannot be reached, no-deal is not the answer. The parliamentary arithmetic means an alternative will be sought, and the EftaEEA model could well be the answer that is decided upon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24da21f9bbc736be7bad58838a7214d\" alt=\"Libby Brooks","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThat’s all from the blog today, thanks so much for your comments. You can read the full story here:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described May’s statement as “dreadful” and her tactics “hugely damaging”.“The Prime Minister’s statement was dreadful. The EU’s view of the Chequers plan was bluntly and clearly expressed in Salzburg yesterday, but should not have come as a surprise to the UK Government, given that it was not a new position.“Clearly, the Prime Minister has not been listening – Chequers is a dead duck but if her tactic now is to try and double down on those proposals and then seek to blame the EU for a no-deal outcome, then she will do huge damage to all of those she is supposed to serve.“It would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit and whose interests in this process have been ignored at every turn by the UK Government.“What the latest development shows more clearly than ever is that the only remotely workable way for Brexit to happen is for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do that, then Brexit shouldn’t happen. A ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit are simply not acceptable – particularly for Scotland, where we did not vote for any of this.”Yesterday, Sturgeon wrote to the leaders of the UK’s opposition parties asking them to join her in pressing for an extension to next March’s deadline for leaving the EU to avoid “an economic cliff edge”.Cabinet ministers have been responding on Twitter, including some warning the EU in stronger terms.The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

In December 1968 Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders – on Apollo 8 – swept over the lunar surface and captured bright blue images of Earth rising above the grey plains of the moon. It was one of the most dramatic space missions ever flown. Manned landings followed, but after a few years, the US lost interest in lunar space flights.But now Nasa has revealed plans to return to the Moon and has asked European scientists and industry leaders to join the agency in a bold plan aimed at rebooting humanity’s conquest of the solar system - in the form of an international manned station that will orbit the moon within the next decade.The proposed station, the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway – known as Gateway – will allow astronauts to develop techniques that will open up the lunar surface to exploration and exploitation. At the same time, the station will help humans hone survival skills in deep space in preparation for future manned missions to Mars, says Nasa.Taking part in the station’s construction would cost Europe more than £1bn and a decision on whether to become involved will be taken at a meeting of European science ministers next year. If ministers give the go-ahead, the European Space Agency (Esa) – of which Britain is a key member – would then join other international partners that Nasa is recruiting to its Gateway project. These include the space agencies of Russia, Canada and Japan.“Essentially, Gateway will be a robotic outpost that will be visited by groups of astronauts – initially for weeks and then for months at a time,” says David Parker, director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration for Esa and a keen supporter of the project. “They will learn how to survive in deep space and deal with problems such as radiation and meteorites. At the same time they will also direct robot craft that will explore the moon’s surface.”A go-ahead for Gateway would also bring to an end the hiatus in manned space exploration that has lasted for almost a decade. Since the grounding of the space shuttle, human spaceflights have been restricted to launches of Russia’s Soyuz space capsule, which is used to ferry crew and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), and the few missions taken by taikonauts on China’s fledgling spacecraft.Gateway should change that – and it will do so by taking advantage of a major advance in US space engineering which will occur when Nasa begins flights with its new deep-space capsule, Orion, and its launcher, the Space Launch System in a few years. These will form the core components of Gateway along with modules similar to those now used as stores and crew quarters on the ISS (see box), though Nasa stresses Gateway will be considerably smaller than their current Earth-orbiting space station.And key to operation of their lunar station will be the extraction, from lunar soil, of minerals, chemicals, and – most important – water. “Recent evidence suggests comets and asteroids have bombarded the moon for billions of years, depositing water – in the form of ice – on to its polar regions,” said Mahesh Anand, reader in planetary science and exploration at the Open University.Scientists like Anand believe it should be possible to use that water to turn the moon into a refuelling station for long-term missions to Mars and beyond. Ice would be harvested, melted and electrolysed – using power generated by solar panels – into its hydrogen and oxygen components. “You could then use that hydrogen and oxygen as liquid propellents,” added Anand. “That is what powered the space shuttle’s main engines after all. Then you could use the moon as a refuelling post to power spaceships to Mars.”It remains a far-off goal. For a start, astronomers do not have precise details of the most promising places to find water on the moon. Finding those sources will not be easy, but not impossible – thanks to Gateway. It will orbit the moon from a height of a few hundred miles and from there astronauts will control robot rovers remotely and send them trundling over the lunar surface to pinpoint areas rich in water ice. Samples could even be sent back to the space station by unmanned spacecraft.Scientists at Esa are already working with Canadian and Japanese space agencies to prepare a robot mission called Heracles, which would travel to the moon sometime in the next decade and which would use the Gateway as a halfway house to store lunar samples before being sent back to Earth. “It will be much easier to drive a robot rover from a height of only a few hundred miles above the moon than from the Earth which is 250,000 miles away,” says Anand. “It will take only a fraction of a second to send a signal and get a response. By contrast it would take several seconds if you are on Earth, making the control of a lunar rover much, much more difficult.”European astronauts recently guided an automated rover on Earth using controls in the ISS – which orbits the Earth at roughly the same height that Gateway would orbit the moon. The technology is therefore already well tested, says Esa.“The moon has lain virtually undisturbed for the last 4.5bn years,” says Parker. “It is a museum of the history of our solar system. And yes, we visited it when we briefly landed Apollo spacecraft there. However, that was the equivalent of going to a museum, heading straight to the gift shop and then leaving. It is the dusty corners of a museum where you find the really interesting stuff – and that is where we are going to go with Gateway.”This point is backed by James Carpenter, a member of Esa’s lunar exploration team. “The major scientific impact of Gateway will undoubtedly come from the way it will open up access to the lunar surface,” he says. “However, there are many other areas of research that will benefit.“We will be able to study the effects of radiation on human physiology we will be able to collect dust particles that come from asteroids or comets or possibly objects outside our solar system. We will be able to study the interaction of the sun and the moon with Earth’s magnetosphere. Gateway would also be ideal for launching tiny CubeSat satellites and other devices that could open up exploration of the solar system.”Carpenter says Esa recently held a workshop to gauge European scientists’ interest in joining Gateway. “Around 250 came along and since then we have received a substantial number of proposals for doing science on the station. There is tremendous enthusiasm in Europe for this project. It is a real opportunity to do the kinds of science that have not been possible before now.”Astronomers are also keen to use Gateway as a platform for assembling deep-space observatories, in particular to study low-frequency radio waves that could give new insights into the early universe not long after its big bang birth 13.8bn years ago. These low-frequency waves are difficult to observe near Earth because of interference from human sources.In addition, Gateway’s location will take it far outside Earth’s protective magnetic field and will leave astronauts exposed to far more intense radiation than is experienced on the ISS. This will provide key opportunities to study the long-term impact of radiation on humans in deep space. “We will ultimately translate that experience toward human missions to Mars,” says William Gerstenmaier, an associate administrator at Nasa headquarters in Washington.This point is backed by Parker. “We have to learn to work for long periods of time up there. The Apollo missions took astronauts into deep space but they only lasted a few days. We are talking of spending months at Gateway in the end and if you want to go to Mars, you will need to spend years in deep space. So we have got to learn to live in our backyard – near the moon – before going on longer journeys.”The critical point about the Gateway project is that it does not depend on new or untested technologies, says Carpenter. “A huge expertise was built up during the design and assembly of the International Space Station. We know the risks involved in building a space station and the technologies that will ensure that its construction will go smoothly. That makes us very confident that Gateway will happen and that it will work.”In short, we may have to wait a bit longer to see a Brit heading to the moon.The key component of the project Gateway mission will be the Orion capsule now being built by space engineers. It is designed to take a crew of four people beyond Earth orbit and into deep space. Orion has two key components: first, a command module, to carry astronauts. This is being built by Lockheed Martin. The second component will beis Orion’s a service module which will provide power and propulsion for the main craft. It is being developed by the European Space Agency (Esa.Orion’s first manned flight is scheduled to take place inby 2023. Once in operation, capsules will be blasted into space on the US’s new generation of high-powered rockets, the Space Launch System which is designed to send heavy payloads towards the moon and planets. SLS rockets will also transport the modules that will be assembled to form Gateway in lunar orbit. These will be based on the modules – such as Esa’s Columbus module – that hold stores, contain research equipment and provide sleeping accommodation for crew now working on the International Space Station.Last week, Nasa announced that Gateway would be fitted with two modules to house astronauts, one to be provided by the United States and the other by Nasa’s international partners. Conditions will be cramped, nevertheless. As currently envisaged, Gateway will have 1,942 cubic feet of habitable volume, compared to the 13,696 cubic feet on the ISS.“Gateway modules will also have to be much lighter than those on ISS because they will have to be blasted much further into space,” says Esa director David Parker. “In addition, the modules will be moved around in space using ion propulsion rockets rather than chemical rockets. The fuel consumption of ion engines is much lower than that of chemical rockets. Versions of ion engines with the kind of thrust we will need for Gateway have not yet been built but are under development and should be ready in plenty of time for the station’s construction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b0a813429f6617464d78277d45a5516ae9fe79/34_7_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33e7b3d39db303ca5dd9a696b4399b05","title":"glasgow alcohol free drinks festival aims to help change culture","story":"It has all the offerings of a typical drinks festival: beer on tap, live music, cocktail masterclasses and competitions to find the best bartender. But the mindful drinking festival coming to Glasgow next month is missing one key ingredient: alcohol.Billed as Scotland’s first alcohol-free drinks festival, the event is organised by Club Soda, a mindful drinking movement with 23,000 members across the UK, and aims to meet growing demand from pubs and bars keen to learn more about alternatives amid rising concern about the health risks of alcohol abuse.“Glasgow recognises itself as a hard-drinking city, and I get the impression that, collectively, people know this is something it needs,” says Laura Willoughby, campaigner and co-founder of Club Soda. It will be the first time the movement has held a festival outside London.Willoughby says prominent public health campaigns, as well as strict drink-driving laws and a vocal debate about Scotland’s alcohol problems, have fuelled a change in attitudes. “Our members in Scotland are far more willing to talk about it because there doesn’t seem to be the stigma around changing your drinking that there is in England,” she says.Dr Eric Carlin, director of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems, welcomes the move to challenge the entrenched notion that socialising and drinking must go hand in hand.“One of the things we’ve found talking to people is that often they’re quite embarrassed about saying they’re not drinking,” he says. “We thoroughly support any move that would make it normal to be out having a good time without alcohol being a part of it all the time.”This is something Rhona Burton, 28, from Glasgow can relate to. After suffering from crippling anxiety following a period of heavy drinking, she decided to cut back on alcohol and has now quit altogether. “Not drinking still holds connotations of being no craic,” she says. “I personally waited so long because I was worried what people would think of me.”So is there a new generation of Scots shunning alcohol? “Young people are drinking less than they ever have been in Scotland,” says Carlin. “However, the ones who are drinking are probably drinking a lot more than used to be the case, so there’s a need for targeted action.”According to the ONS release on adult drinking habits in Great Britain, Scots report drinking less overall than in England, but have higher rates of binge-drinking.Carlin also stresses the importance of addressing drinking among older people, particularly in middle age. “That’s the group which is drinking the most in Scotland, and suffering the most harm as a result,” he says.In a bid to reach this audience, the mindful drinking festival will run workshops and talks in collaboration with Drink Wise Age Well, a Glasgow-based campaign aimed at helping people make healthier alcohol choices as they age.“I still think Scotland has a long way to go with drinking, as you are trying to retrain a culture,” says Rhona Burton. “But I think bringing a cool status to sobriety would help us rethink.”“It’s no secret Scotland has a troubled relationship with alcohol, with nearly 700 hospital admissions and an average of 22 deaths per week from alcohol misuse.“A key milestone in tackling this was the introduction of minimum unit pricing earlier this year, which will save lives, reduce hospital admissions and, ultimately, have positive impacts across our communities.“Ventures such as the Mindful Drinking Festival are always welcome, providing as they do, a friendly, sociable space for people to have a good time while enjoying an alternative to alcoholic drinks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d52d001adf008df1e5243a4de217ab8a1085fc8/0_48_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea244fff9063b1ceca9f4ef4f03ae664","title":"bath northampton premiership rugby report","story":"• Bath 17-15 Northampton• Home side move up to fourth in Premiership tableTwo weeks after Bath’s opening home match of the season had ended in a draw when they conceded a late try and conversion, they again faced the prospect of throwing away victory at the climax when failure to clear their line allowed Tom Collins to plunder a try that presented Dan Biggar with the opportunity to level the scores.It had been Biggar’s sort of match, incessant rain washing away skills, breeding mistakes and firing resolution. It was the Wales fly-half’s penalty seven minutes from the end that revived Northampton after they had looked spent at 17-7 down and he was involved in the move that ended with Collins scoring after Elliott Stooke looked to have secured victory for Bath by stealing a Saints lineout five metres from his line.Collins scored in the left-hand corner, leaving Biggar with a touchline conversion. The silence of the crowd behind the posts hinted that, like Gloucester’s Billy Twelvetrees two weeks before, the 2017 Lion had succeeded, but the ball suddenly veered to the right and hit a post. Time was up and Bath kicked the ball dead to secure their second consecutive victory and move into the top four.The murk smothering the club after the opening-night defeat at Bristol has lifted to let in some light and allow time for breath, but Bath next face Saracens and Exeter in the Premiership, before encounters with Toulouse and Wasps in the European Champions Cup. In the fickle world of professional sport, glory and crisis sometimes occupy adjoining beds.Bath were hanging on at times in the first half after Freddie Burns missed an early penalty shortly after the centre Aled Brew had suffered a suspected broken wrist, but for all their possession, Northampton rarely threatened. They kept the ball in hand more than sent it into the air and, on an afternoon when handling was hazardous, it was the wrong tactic, all the more so because they were exposed in the set pieces.The England captain, Dylan Hartley, was on the field for an hour, one of the more secure handlers on an afternoon of knock-ons, but his throwing into the lineout was unusually wonky. He was off target with five of his 16 throws and Saints looked to have blown their chance of a draw two minutes from time when the replacement hooker Mike Haywood found Stooke and not Courtney Lawes.Burns’s first penalty miss came after Northampton’s scrum had disintegrated when Bath had sent it into reverse gear but, despite their set-piece superiority, they spent most of the opening period in their own half. Even so, they should have gone into the interval ahead having fallen behind after 18 minutes to a try by the scrum-half Cobus Reinach that was to sum up the messy nature of the match.When Piers Francis secured a loose ball and cut inside, his pass to Ahsee Tuala was knocked on by Burns. Reinach hacked the ball to the line and fell on it to score. Ten minutes later, Reinach was on Bath’s 22 looking to free Andrew Symons when his pass was picked off by Burns who ran 80 metres to level the scores.Burns missed a penalty from virtually under the posts one minute before the interval but became the game’s influential figure after the break, pinning back Northampton with long kicks and playing the percentages. His penalty after 54 minutes gave Bath the lead for the first time and his conversion wide on the left at the start of the third quarter effectively ensured victory.A prospect before the match had been of two imposing wings, Bath’s Joe Cokanasiga and Northampton’s Taqele Naiyaravoro, with a combined weight of more than 37st, thundering to each other. The latter ended up on the left wing despite wearing 14 because he prefers to hold the ball in his left hand and plant a hand-off on an opponent with his right, but for the second week in a row he was virtually a spectator, touching the ball four times before being replaced on 55 minutes.He had not had his tracksuit on for long when Cokanasiga extended Bath’s lead. Burns chipped speculatively ahead, knowing that a penalty advantage was being played, and retrieved the ball before Stooke’s long pass found the wing, who was name-checked last week by the England head coach, Eddie Jones, before the autumn internationals. His third try of the campaign followed before Bath, as is their custom, made their supporters fret."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7db1669d95a6f690bba1a3c5bd52e57a64ecc2e/0_225_5283_3169/master/5283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e7be18a5aa86d90fb2102947bdfc5b","title":"ardnish scotland highlands walk peanmeanach lochailort ansell","story":"This rugged, now uninhabited landscape of remote lochs and ancient woodland has an austere beauty and reminders of Bonnie Prince Charlie, crofters and VikingsThe peninsulas of the Rough Bounds of Lochaber in the north-west Highlands stretch out into the Atlantic like the fingers of an outstretched hand, pointing out towards the Small Isles of Rum and Eigg, and Skye’s Cuillin mountains. The lochs that separate them include the deepest freshwater and deepest seas loch in Scotland. Parts of the area are notoriously wild and inaccessible, sparsely populated and more forested than most of the Highlands, with northern birch woods, temperate rainforests of stunted sessile oak, and even some relic fragments of the great Caledonian pine forest.My book, The Last Wilderness, recounts a year of exploring the area, on foot and alone. Much of my walking inevitably went off-trail and involved multiple nights of wild camping, but here is a well-established route that can either be readily managed as a day walk or enlivened by an overnight stay.Ardnish is a small uninhabited peninsula – uninhabited perhaps for the first time in millennia, for there are mysterious pre-Roman vitrified forts on an offshore island and the footprints of boathouses for Viking longboats. Most conspicuously, though, the shores are fringed with a succession of abandoned crofting villages. The landscape is rugged and wild, but you are constantly reminded that this was once people’s home, and as with most places that have gone to ruin, a sense of history and near-forgotten lives hangs heavy in the air.The nearest settlement is Lochailort, midway between Fort William and Mallaig on the West Highland Line. It is a tiny village, small enough that it is a request stop only for the train, and has no services save for one hotel, the Lochailort Inn (doubles £90 B\u0026ampB), the one place offering food, drink and accommodation for miles around. The trail begins from a layby two miles west of the village on the Road to the Isles (A830), just past Loch Dubh. The walk from here is a seven-mile return journey that is steep in places, and can get boggy in others. The marked trail leads down into birch woods, veering right before turning to cross a footbridge over the railway line, and then an even shonkier footbridge over a stream on the valley floor. Then you begin a stiff climb to the tops. As you rise through the autumn birch woods, keep a look out for the flocks of fieldfares and redwings that have just arrived ravenous from Scandinavia and are feasting on the rowan berries. These flocks may amount to thousands. As you climb you will get fine views across Loch nan Uamh. Just opposite is the Prince’s Cairn, marking the spot where Bonnie Prince Charlie made landfall in 1745, and from where he beat a hasty retreat the following year after his defeat at the Battle of Culloden and the collapse of the Jacobite rebellion. He would never set foot in Britain again.After a long uphill climb, you finally crest the ridge onto the open tops and can see the trail stretching into the distance, winding through open moorland and between outcrops of rock. Though the route is boggy in places, it is mostly made of slabs of stone and the way ahead is always visible. A lot of man-hours were expended on constructing this route, well over a century ago. Autumn sees the start of the red deer rut, so you may hear stags bellowing across the hills. And look out for eagles – both golden and sea eagles are resident in the area.The trail leads to a mountain loch, Doire a’ Ghearrain, which is a cerulean blue in fine weather. From here it is all downhill, loosely following a stream that leads to our destination. There are fine views west out to sea and to the Sgurr of Eigg and the mountains of Rum. Crossing the burn by stepping stones, the path leads down through a superb ancient oak wood to a coastal plain once used for grazing by the crofters, now very reedy and wet underfoot, and finally to Peanmeanach bay and the ruined village.The abandoned village consists of seven blackhouses in a line on a grassy ridge that backs the dunes of a fine white sand beach. One has been renovated as a bothy, and it is possible to stay here, though you should take care to abide by the bothy code – no large groups and leave things as you find them. There is no guarantee that it will not already be full, so if planning to stay overnight come equipped for wild camping. The other houses are all roofless shells – they would once have been thatched with reeds. They are simple drywalled stone with tiny windows and doorways, and all have elegantly bevelled corners to deflect the onshore winds.In the 1841 census, these seven houses accommodated 48 people. It is hard to imagine how they all fitted in, and probably with their livestock too. A century later, there was just one person remaining. The final resident, Nellie MacQueen, lived in the house that is now a bothy, and was the daughter of the former postmaster and the former schoolmistress. She finally moved on during the second world war, unable to survive on wartime rations one candle a week was simply not enough to see her through the long nights of a Scottish winter. It is said she returned for a visit just once, 40 years later, and walked the length of the village tapping each house with a stick and calling out the names of the people who had once lived there.This whole area was deeply affected by the Clearances. On the larger peninsula of Knoydart, not far to the north, every last one of its crofting population was evicted by the laird to make way for sheep farming – almost a 1,000 people, who mostly emigrated to Canada. On Ardnish the residents were not evicted as the land was deemed too marginal, and rather it became a dumping ground for people evicted from elsewhere, so that the population swelled to numbers that were simply unsustainable in a place where people were already living a hand-to-mouth existence.It was poverty that killed this community, exacerbated by a succession of blows over the course of a century – the collapse of the herring fisheries, the crash in the price for soda ash which was extracted from dried kelp, the potato blight, and the first world war. One by one, people gave up and moved away, either taking the opportunity for subsidised emigration or to seek work in the cities of the lowlands. Finally, all that was left was the empty shells of the places they had once called home.If you have time, explore some of the peninsula’s stunning wild coastline. Look out for otters on the shore, and for seals and even dolphins out on the bay. If you stay overnight, the red deer descend from the hills during the hours of darkness to feed on the low ground, and seem to lose all fear of man. If you are camping here in autumn you can expect a restless night, surrounded as you are by the echoing roars of the stags just feet away from you. It just adds to the otherworldliness of this extraordinary place.Neil Ansell is author of The Last Wilderness: A Journey into Silence, (Tinder Press, 2018, £9.99)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

And so, on Friday night in Dallas, the Republican came out fightingIt underlines America’s strange and turbulent political moment that the highest-profile and most intriguing battle in November’s midterm elections is in one of the most predictably Republican states.“We have a real race in the state of Texas,” the Republican senator Ted Cruz said during a bruising debate with Beto O’Rourke on Friday. “The hard left is energised, they are angry, many of them are filled with hatred for President Trump.”Less than three years ago, before Donald Trump surged clear, Cruz was arguably the favourite for the Republican presidential nomination. Now he faces a scrap to keep his Senate seat amid swelling Democratic optimism that a “blue wave” can gain a majority in the House of Representatives and perhaps even the Senate.Democrats need to pick up two seats to take the Senate, though the House is a more realistic target. Winning back either chamber would help them stymie Trump’s agenda and show they are in a strong position to win the White House in 2020.Challenging Cruz is O’Rourke, a charismatic politician from the border city of El Paso who was a virtual unknown a year ago. Cruz is the frontrunner but O’Rourke has the momentum and attention.Recent polls range from a nine-point Cruz lead to a two-point O’Rourke edge. On Friday, a few hours before the pair’s hour-long head-to-head in Dallas, the respected Cook Political Report newsletter shifted the race from “lean Republican” to “toss-up”.A US congressman of Irish heritage who is giving up a safe House seat, O’Rourke is a tall, trim, handsome figure whose appearance is often compared with Robert Kennedy. Arrested in his 20s for burglary and driving while intoxicated (though not convicted), he played guitar in a punk band and ran an internet business before turning to politics.The 45-year-old has become the political equivalent of a rock star, holding standing room-only rallies attended by thousands, inspiring fawning profiles and being feted by left-leaning celebrities in Hollywood and New York.The Texas GOP looked fusty when they mocked O’Rourke for skateboarding in the car park of a Whataburger fast-food restaurant last month. And his cool credentials were boosted when Willie Nelson, the venerable Texan country music legend, revealed plans to headline a pro-O’Rourke gig in Austin.The race is one of several surprisingly tight contests in Texas this year as the increasingly erse demographics of urban areas mix with determined resistance to Trumpism and the concerns of some moderate Republicans.Texas’ four biggest cities, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Austin, all voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. But suburban and rural areas remained firmly Republican, handing Trump a nine-point victory.Texas is the second-most populous state behind solidly-blue California: flipping it is a Democrat’s dream. Republicans have been so dominant – a Democrat last won a statewide race in 1994 – that Democrats have struggled to find talented and well-funded candidates. Yet despite pledging to take only small contributions from iniduals, O’Rourke has out-raised Cruz, netting an impressive $24m.“It’s clear that O’Rourke is a unique figure and has a presence that has stimulated Democrats,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “I also think it does suggest that there is a rising tide of dissatisfaction with Republicans and some of the policies, especially with Donald Trump.“The importance of the race is that as more Democrats begin to awaken you may see Texas drifting towards competitive in a presidential race which will lock the Democrats at the presidential level for a long time. In short, if Texas goes blue, no Republican can ever win the presidency until there’s some other major change.”In a sign of his concern, Cruz – who called Trump “utterly amoral”, a “pathological liar” and a “sniveling coward” not long before endorsing him for president – has invited Trump to ride to the rescue with a rally next month. In 2016, Trump baselessly linked Cruz’s father to the assassination of John F Kennedy and retweeted an unflattering photo of Cruz’s wife, Heidi, with an image of his own wife, Melania, a former model.“I’m picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find,” Trump tweeted in August. “Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas.”During campaign stops typically conducted at calorific barbecue joints, Cruz has depicted O’Rourke as a radical Bernie Sanders-style socialist who wants to introduce deranged policies such as healthcare for all, banning the sale of military-style rifles, combating climate change, not cutting taxes for rich people and reforming the immigration system to make it more humane.O’Rourke has largely avoided talking about Cruz and Trump, preferring to preach a gospel of inclusivity and consensus. On Friday, that strategy took a battering.While O’Rourke backed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Cruz enthused over Trump’s planned border wall. As O’Rourke advocated background checks for gun buyers, Cruz insisted school shootings are caused not by guns but by “removing God from the public square”.O’Rourke backed the right of American football players to protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. As for the recent fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Dallas by a white officer who claimed she mistook his apartment for her own and thought he was a burglar?When each man was asked at the end to offer something positive about his opponent, O’Rourke praised Cruz’s commitment to public service and empathised with the toll that travel and long hours take on family life. Cruz replied in the same vein before inserting a backhanded compliment.“I think you are absolutely sincere, like Bernie, that you believe in expanding government and higher taxes and I commend you for fighting for what you believe in.”“True to form,” O’Rourke muttered darkly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b751bc95cfd9ab9d699a11a0defc98a0044637/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ef4a5eebcbf265f03db77dbba69bd5","title":"what masculinity means when youre gay bi or trans ","story":"We’re in the middle of a ‘genderquake’ where the qualities traditionally associated with men are changing daily. So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

Thousands gathered in October 2014 to watch the announcement live from Brussels in a central piazza. “It reminded me of the day when Napoli announced it had acquired Diego Maradona,” said Daniele Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman who has invested in a hotel in Matera. “The same uproar was heard throughout the town.”But the euphoria was quickly replaced by a sense of anxiety. “After the celebrations,” said Eustachio Nicoletti, Matera’s secretary for Italy’s largest labour union, the CGIL, “people began to wonder, ‘and what the hell are we going to do now?’”Today, with little over three months remaining until 2019, that concern has become a real fear that the city’s big opportunity could instead be a colossal failure. Local organisations and business owners are warning that the city will simply not be ready. Rome and Brussels secured €400m (£360m) to organise the year’s events, money that was supposed to pay for restoring buildings and repairing streets in a place famed for its stunning but dilapidated beauty and history of dire poverty.But, according to the unions, most of the money is still trapped in the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy and has not yet been spent.“Of the seven buildings that should have housed the cultural events, at least five will not be ready in time for 2019,” said Nicoletti.Concern also surrounds accessibility: half of the funding, about €200m, had been allocated for the construction of a new railway line. The station is there – it was built in 1986 – but there is no railway. Matera can still be reached only by a slow, secondary rail line from Bari, which takes nearly two hours to cover 60km, while work to complete the Bradanica highway, connecting the city with the north of the Basilicata region, began almost 40 years ago and has yet to be completed.“The truth is that the disregard for not meeting deadlines was already well known in 2014,” said Enzo Acito, former director of tourism for Matera. “Everyone knew that with the snail’s pace of Italian bureaucracy and the typical waiting times for the construction industry in Italy, the facilities would never be completed by 2019.”Matera was the first southern Italian city to be recognised as a European capital of culture. But, like many towns across the region, it bears the wounds of structural deficiencies, such as high youth unemployment, alleged corruption and obscure political manoeuvrings. In July the president of the Basilicata region, Marcello Pittella, was placed under house arrest by prosecutors in Matera for alleged involvement in rigging healthcare contracts. He denies all the accusations against him.Such problems, often chronic in the south of Italy, are exacerbated by historic and deeply rooted difficulties in a town which was virtually abandoned for more than 40 years after the second world war. Cut off from the modern economy, Matera was one of Europe’s poorest cities, where families lived in grottoes, the “Sassi” (literally stones) carved out of the limestone that dated back to Matera’s prehistoric era.The extent of the squalid conditions in the Sassi only came to international attention when writer Carlo Levi was exiled by Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime to a town close to Matera in 1935. In his book, Christ Stopped at Eboli, published in 1945, Levi described the horror he witnessed – the paltry furniture, children either naked or in rags, bodies ravaged by disease – and concluded: “I have never seen in all my life such a picture of poverty.”In 1952 Italy’s prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi proclaimed a state of emergency in Matera, described by Rome as “a national disgrace”. The inhabitants of the Sassi were eventually evacuated and relocated a few kilometres away. Matera would remain deserted and silent until 1993 when Unesco declared the Sassi, once a source of national shame and a symbol of poverty and disease, a world heritage site, following a long list of achievements that eventually led to its selection, along with Plov in Bulgaria, as a 2019 European capital of culture.But Matera’s fate after next year is an open question. “It’s the fear that we all share at this time,” said Nicoletti. “When it’s all over – the firework display, the cultural events and the attention – what will be Matera’s fate?”Paolo Verri, director of the Matera-Basilicata 2019 Foundation in charge of the organisation of the cultural events, shrugs off any blame and insists the year of culture will go ahead. “We will carry out the events as we have planned,” he said. “We can’t control infrastructure. It’s not our responsibility. What I can say is that in the past few years we have quadrupled the number of visitors in Matera and, at the end of the event, it will always be in the spotlight.”Nicoletti has a different view. In 2017, the CGIL published a report – entitled Matera 2019: missed opportunity? – in which researchers tried to analyse the city’s future after the event. The conclusions seem anything but rosy.“The risk is that the facilities slated for completion by 2019 won’t even be ready by 2020,” said Nicoletti. “The risk is that the city will have lost an opportunity to create jobs for its people, who each year emigrate toward northern Italy. The risk is to have missed a train that won’t be coming back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/628d357d6a2272d2268adc9432792f6a794e7083/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee06f1ba003fbc7c6c97d142426515e","title":"vatican pope francis agreement with china nominating bishops","story":"The Vatican and China said yesterday they had signed a historic agreement on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops, a breakthrough on an issue that for decades fuelled tensions between the Holy See and Beijing and thwarted efforts toward diplomatic relations.The provisional agreement, which was signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was described by the Vatican as “the fruit of a gradual and reciprocal rapprochement”, following a long process of careful negotiation, and subject to periodic review.“It concerns the nomination of bishops, a question of great importance for the life of the church, and creates the conditions for greater collaboration,” the Vatican said.In Beijing, the foreign ministry put out a statement saying: “China and the Vatican will continue to maintain communications and push forward the process of improving relations between the two sides.”“The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the church in China but for the whole church because it damages the credibility,” he added.The Vatican said that, as part of the deal, the pope would recognise seven Chinese bishops who were appointed by Beijing without the Vatican’s approval, and were excommunicated as illegitimate. Sources told Reuters the accord gave the Vatican a say in the naming of bishops and granted the pope veto power over candidates. China’s Catholics are split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican, and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA).The possibility of such a deal has ided Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism.Greg Burke, director of the Holy See press office, acknowledged there was work to be done to reassure those who have opposed the agreement. “This is not the end of a process. It’s the beginning. This has been about dialogue, patient listening on both sides even when people come from very different standpoints. The objective of the accord is not political but pastoral, allowing the faithful to have bishops who are in communion with Rome but, at the same time, recognised by Chinese authorities.”The deal has been done amid a crackdown by the Chinese regime on Christians and followers of other faiths in recent years. Churches have been closed down crosses and other religious symbols have been removed.President Xi Jinping introduced a programme to “Sinicise” all religious practice, insisting that it must be “Chinese in orientation”. The government must “provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to socialist society”, he said.The explosion of Christianity in the country has mainly been seen in Protestant evangelical churches. Catholicism is a relatively minor religion, with an estimated 10-12 million adherents.They are supposed to worship only in churches approved by the CPA, a state-controlled body. But many attend unregistered churches under the authority of bishops who are not recognised by the Chinese authorities.The Vatican has been keen to re-create ties with Beijing ever since the Communist authorities broke off diplomatic relations in 1951. Pope Francis has vigorously pursued rapprochement with the rising superpower.He has sent gifts to Xi, his homilies have been translated into Chinese, and last year the Vatican dispatched 40 artworks to Beijing in a cultural exchange which, according to a senior Chinese official, signalled the “strong commitment for the development of civil relations” between the two.Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington who resigned as a cardinal in July after facing allegations of sexual abuse, has been a regular envoy from the Vatican to Beijing, according to the Catholic News Agency.A sign of Francis’s eagerness to curry favour with the Chinese has been his refusal to meet the Dalai Lama, knowing such an encounter would anger Beijing. The thaw between the two powers has come under fire from some in the church. Two years ago, Cardinal Zen said a rapprochement would be “betraying Jesus Christ” and a “surrender”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2f612d0d9aba19232f83feb72988eeec1e68f2/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1060f1bd31e7d775f13029640d95684a","title":"the displaced indigenous communities of colombia in pictures","story":"Cocaine trafficking and the battle to control land in the country’s Valle del Cauca department are forcing indigenous and Afro-Colombian people to flee their homes.

Photo: Julien BehalThe Democratic Unionist Party cannot be allowed to veto a Brexit deal on the Border, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney said the issue of the backstop agreement, that would ensure no hard border in a no-deal Brexit scenario, had turned into a “green and orange issue”. However, the Government did not want to “undermine or threaten the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in Brexit negotiations”, Mr Coveney said.“That is not what this is about and unfortunately some people have turned the mechanism to get this famous backstop agreed as that kind of agenda which it isn’t,” he added.Mr Coveney said he is hopeful for significant progress by October despite a week that saw British prime minister Theresa May accuse EU leaders of driving Brexit negotiations into an impasse after they rejected her Chequers plan for Brexit.“The really sticky issue at the moment is can we find a solution on the backstop. I believe we can,” Mr Coveney told the Marian Finucane show on RTÉ radio. “Hopefully we will make significant progress on it by the leaders’ summit in October, to be concluded in November.“The British government has committed in the last 48 hours to producing new text on that in terms of their approach and what’s needed is an intensification of engagement in the negotiation teams,” he added.He said he believed the the DUP would accept that Northern Ireland “is not the same as Kent or a borough in London” and it has “so many differences “ to other parts of the UK. He said, for example if a person is born in Northern Ireland they have a birth right to Irish or British citizenship or both.He said there was “no question of a border down the Irish sea. What we are trying to ensure is that there are minimal checks required. If the United Kingdom is outside the customs union and single market and if goods travel from one customs union into another or from one single market into another there has to be some checking system.“These are practical realities of trade and we are trying to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in a way that is threatening to unionism but in a way that can protect the concerns of both unionists and nationalists neither of whom want a border re-emerging on the island of Ireland.”Mr Coveney told the programme he believed Britain and the EU would be weakened by Brexit and that Ireland would also be damaged because it is “caught in the middle”.When asked if he had spoken to the DUP about the issues at hand he said they had and with other parties, adding: “ We cannot allow one party in Northern Ireland to veto any proposals.“The British government has a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP but we don’t have a confidence and supply agreement with any one party in Northern Ireland.”On Friday, in a seven-minute televised address from Downing Street, the British prime minister said the EU should treat Britain with more respect and that its proposal to avoid a hard Border in Ireland would break up the UK.“The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country,” she said.Ms May said Britain would set out its own backstop proposal, adding that it would include a commitment that there would be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, which are currently suspended, agree.The prime minister’s defiant statement followed an informal meeting of EU leaders in the Austrian city of Salzburg which left her humiliated when European Council president Donald Tusk and other leaders dismissed the economic proposals in her Chequers plan.After the meeting, French president Emmanuel Macron, one of the fiercest critics of the Chequers plan, admonished Brexiteers that the Leave vote had been “pushed by those who predicted easy solutions,” adding: “Those people are liars.”Mr Tusk, after a difficult closing meeting with May, did not help relations by posting a photograph on Instagram of him offering May a cake with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” – a reference to the EU’s oft-stated refusal to allow the UK “cherry-pick” EU rules that it likes.On Saturday, the UK’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged EU leaders to “step back from the abyss” of a no-deal Brexit and to engage with Theresa May’s plan, so called because it was agreed in the PM’s country house in Chequers.Following the angry clashes of the Salzburg summit, Mr Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote and to say the only way the UK could legally leave was by “breaking up your country”.“What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”Mr Hunt warned there would be “disruption” on both sides of the Channel in the event of a disorderly Brexit, with one estimate suggesting a million jobs could be lost across the EU.“What Theresa May is saying is ‘Don’t mistake British politeness for weakness. If you put us in a difficult corner we will stand our ground. That is the kind of country we are,‘” he told the Today programme.“Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jack TaylorAFPGetty ImagesSo, any progress this week on progress towards a deal on Brexit?Eh, no. In fact, the stalemate in the negotiations has become even more stale.The EU and UK are no closer to a deal and only got each other’s backs up after a disastrous EU summit in Salzburg as both sides dig in on their positions and the rhetoric becomes even more tetchy.Where do both sides stand now?EU leaders categorically rejected Theresa May’s Chequers plan that would create an EU-UK free trade area covering industrial goods and agricultural products after the Brexit in March 2019.European Council president Donald Tusk said the plan “will not work” and gave her four weeks to rescue the Brexit talks, describing the next EU summit on October 18th as “a moment of truth” to provide a solution to avoid a hard Border in Ireland before any final Brexit treaty could be agreed.May dug in, saying that her proposal was the “only plan on the table” and the only “serious and credible” plan to create frictionless EU-UK trade that could maintain an open Irish Border.She went further in a televised statement from Downing Street on Friday, saying that there was no “credible alternative” from the EU and that rejecting Chequers plan without an alternative at this “late stage” was “not acceptable”. She called on the EU to treat the UK with “respect”.The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland effectively stay in the customs union and the single market when the rest of the UK leaves. May strongly dismissed this as it would “dislocate” the UK.She also ruled out a re-run of the Brexit referendum, as some European leaders hope. “I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country,” she said in a pugnacious address.How have things become so acrimonious?Hopes of progress in Salzburg or at least warm words about a potential compromise to avoid a no-deal Brexit were dashed as the EU ramped up pressure on May to propose something more acceptable to Brussels, either close alignment to the single market and customs union for all of the UK or a text around a legally binding “backstop” agreement to avoid physical infrastructure on the EU-UK border in Ireland.What was expected to be an informal summit in Austria this week exposed the gulf between the sides and the EU dismissed the UK with some harsh words and in a humiliating way.EU leaders were annoyed at what they saw as further attempts by the UK to rattle European solidarity on Brexit and undermine the European Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.They were also not impressed with May rehashing the UK’s “red line” conditions and needlessly setting new ones, by effectively saying it was Chequers or nothing and calling on the EU in a German newspaper article on the eve of the summit not to demand something “unacceptable”.Afterwards, French president Emmanuel Macron, one of the fiercest critics of the Chequers plan, admonished Brexiteers that the Leave vote had been “pushed by those who predicted easy solutions,” adding: “Those people are liars.”Tusk, after a difficult closing meeting with May, did not help relations by posting a photograph on Instagram of him offering May a cake with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” – a reference to the EU’s oft-stated refusal to allow the UK “cherry-pick” EU rules that it likes.What does May want now?She has called on the EU to table new proposals so they can discuss them. “It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals,” she said.And what do the Irish want?Dublin is seeking an intensification of the negotiations and a proposed text from the UK on the backstop. The Government is supportive of Barnier’s attempts (since July) to “de-dramatise” this option.What does this mean? EU negotiators are essentially arguing that the backstop might not mean new checks on the Border between Britain and Northern Ireland given that there are already inspections on animal health and food safety and that any new checks could take place away from the ports and airports, at farms and factories.Are there any other ideas being floated?Yes, one proposal involves a “backstop to a backstop”.Yes, to complicate things further, this is one solution being worked by EU negotiators, with support from Dublin. Given the problem around sequencing – a future trade deal could solve the Border issue but cannot be agreed until the Border issue is resolved – the EU would offer flexibility by proposing to negotiate a better version of backstop if the trade talks solve most but not all of the Border issue.So what to watch for next?The Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, starting on September 30th, will test May’s resolve to stick with her Chequers plan and confidence in her leadership that she can deliver Brexit in the face of hardline opposition from within a bitterly ided party.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Ireland may recognise a Palestinian state if peace talks with Israel aimed at producing a two-state solution in the region continue to stagnate.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland has already committed to recognising a Palestinian state as part of a peace process. However, if negotiations between Palestine and Israel continue to prove fruitless “we may have to forget the second part of that.” He speculated other European countries would take a similar position.Mr Coveney’s remarks came during a joint press conference with Palestinian National Authority foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki. Mr al-Maliki \u0026nbspwas in Dublin with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas where they also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and President Michael D Higgins. The delegation is on its way to New York where Mr Abbas will speak at the United Nations General Assembly. The core of his address will be a need for the international community to rescue the a two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict or abandon it altogether.More than 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the latest round of clashes in the region began in March.Mr Coveney’s willingness to recognise a Palestinian state if talks continue to falter goes a step beyond the Fine Gaelcommitment on recognition as part of a peace process.“We have made a choice not to officially recognise the state of Palestine just yet,” said the Minister. “But if this hopelessness continues in terms of the dialogue working we will be forced to review that for obvious reasons, as I think a lot of other countries in Europe will too.”He also announced the Government is considering hosting a meeting in Ireland between leaders of Arab and European countries and Palestinian representatives in a bid to restart the stalled peace process. Ireland will also increase its funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees from €4.5 million to €7 million this year to help plug the gap left by the Trump administration’s decision to pull $200 million in funding from the agency. Mr Coveney called the US decision “a mistake”.The potential meeting was welcomed by Mr al-Maliki as a way for allowing “the international community to take up its own responsibility to seek action when it comes to Palestinian-Israeli peace process”. Asked if he believes Israel is moving towards imposing an apartheid-style regime in Palestinian territories, Mr Coveney replied that it is not difficult to find examples of injustice in the region.“We have an occupation of the Palestinian territories,” he said. And while that occupation is taking place we are seeing an expansion of Israeli settlements on to Palestinian lands. In our view that is illegal.”He also noted the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israeli forces, including the planned destruction of the Bedouin community of Khan\u0026nbspal-Ahmar\u0026nbspin West Bank. Mr Coveney criticised the closing of the office of Palestinian Liberation Organisation office in Washington DC by the Trump administration.“We need sustained dialogue if we are to make a breakthrough in the Middle East peace Process. We believe that shutting down channels of communications is never a good idea.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637570.1537561635!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord tourists ask higgins to show them the way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins and his wife, Sabina, the National Ploughing Association director Anna May McHugh,  and chairman of the National Ploughing Association, Denis Keohane. Photograph: Tom HonanPresident Higgins must be very keen to keep to his campaign timetable, we mused, as he addressed the crowd at the Ploughing.He appeared to be wearing two watches.However, upon closer inspection, we discovered that Michael D was wearing a Fitbit on his wrist, along with a watch.We hear he has embarked on a major fitness regime to prepare for the electoral fray and has already lost a lot of weight. There certainly seemed to be less of him in his Donegal tweed three-piece when he was working the crowd in Screggan on Tuesday.The man was everywhere these days. The following night, he turned up at a traditional music session at the Clé club in Dublin’s Liberty Hall. The Clé (meaning left) club was set up by a group of Labour Party and trade union members during the boom as an antidote to the brash K Club set polluting the airwaves and newspaper columns at the time.Members meet to sing songs, play tunes, tell yarns and act the maggot.Michael D and Sabina turned up at an evening dedicated to the memory of former trade union official, socialist and renowned singer Jimmy Kelly, brother of Luke. The Kelly gang were out in force, led by Jimmy’s wife, Máirín.The crowd included Jimmy’s friends from Siptu, the People’s College Choir, the Góilín singers club and anyone who ever warbled a note at the Clé club. The surprise visit of the President and his wife added a special dimension to the night. Jimmy was a close friend of both of them and Sabina Coyne was bridesmaid at Luke’s wedding to actor Deirdre O’Connell.Michael D was in his element, singing along.Eugene McEldowney, late of this parish, channelled his inner Delia Murphy, with a rousing version of “Thank You Mam, Says Dan” while mountaineer Frank Nugent sang the Ewan MacCall song “The Joy of Living!”It was noted that the President knew all the words of “Three Lovely Lassies from Kimmage” and he loudly cheered when John Sheehan of the Dubliners took the stage. Politics was off the agenda but the election was clearly on everyone’s mind. In an ecumenical gesture, veteran trade unionist and MC Des Geraghty introduced Sinn Féin councillor Larry O’Toole before he sang as “a guaranteed number two”.At the end of the night, there was quite a hullabaloo on Eden Quay as the President was departing, with selfies galore on the footpath.In the middle of all of this, a couple of tourists – a mature German couple – wandered into the company. The man held out a piece of paper and said something to Michael D, who patted his pockets as if to find a pen. But someone else grabbed the President’s attention before he was driven away.The Germans, it turned out, were lost and trying to find directions to their Airbnb accommodation in Donaghmede on Dublin’s northside.They couldn’t believe it when informed they had just asked the President of Ireland for directions to their lodgings. The balladeers put them in a taxi and sent them on their way.When it’s Culture Night and you happen to be the Minister for Culture, it’s always good to have a little something prepared if called upon to do a turn.So when Josepha Madigan attended a poetry event compered by Olivia O’Leary in the Seanad Chamber on Friday to mark the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, she wasn’t found wanting. Josepha, who already has one self-published novel, “Negligent Behaviour”, under her belt and spent part of her summer break at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Monaghan working on a follow-up, performed one of her own poems on Culture Night. She writes poetry too and is hoping to publish her first volume in the near future.The Minister read “Diet Coke”, a wistful and very touching piece about how she felt when her father died and how those feelings came rushing back when her younger sister Edwina was dying from cancer in 2016.Earlier in the week, the solicitor-turned-TD displayed another string to her bow when she officially opened the Goethe Institut’s new Merrion Square premises.Three-quarters of her speech was in German. Her audience was delighted.She said it was her first time speaking in German as a minister, but she studied the language in college before going on to study law.“There was even a time when I lived in Vienna, almost 30 years ago, that I used to dream in German. I used to keep a diary and wrote everything in German as if it were a secret language. Apparently, I speak German with a Cork accent.”Then Josepha told them she still has to “practise my Hochdeutsch and not descend into spontaneous Umgangssprache”.The crowd gave her a standing ovation.While Labour’s Alan Kelly was exhorting his colleagues to have a greater media presence at his party’s think-in behind closed doors in Drogheda, the media was doing its best to help the process along.The party was in the D Hotel in Senator Ged Nash’s home town. As members tried to appear nonchalant in the face of recent ructions about leader Brendan Howlin’s suitability for the job, they retired to the safety of their conference room and shouted at each other in private.Unfortunately, the press room was located close by and journalists were able to hear what was being said by the politicians if they stood in a small ante-room between the two spaces. When a party official rumbled them, he stayed inside the door, shooing hacks away when they tried to creep up again.But there was a story to be filed and the intrepid political scoop merchants were determined to hear what Alan “AK47” Kelly was going to say inside the hall.So they left the press room and galloped around en mass to the main door and pressed themselves up against it. This worked a treat, as the following day’s newspapers duly showed.Requests to “clear the floor” from an official were ignored. So in the end, a woman from headquarters stood on the other side of the door and started drumming her nails against the wood until the discussions were over.A photograph of the journalists doing their thing surfaced on social media and it made our inky hearts swell with old-fashioned pride."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637403.1537557631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan for dublin bus overhaul faces major roadblocks as opposition mounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA setion of the crowd at the public meeting in Portmarnock. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe So many came that Lahart abandoned a summer break in west Kerry and drove home to cope with the concerns from local residents fearful that their route would be impacted.He was not alone. Noel Rock, a Fine Gael TD for Dublin North West, who yesterday called on the National Transport Authority to extend the public consultation period for the plan, was erecting posters in his own constituency\u0026nbspadvertising a public meeting on the bus plan, when the scale of public concern became evident to him.TDs often organise public meetings just to have a handy excuse to hang posters outside of election time – such advertisements are permitted – but never expect significant turnout at the subsequent event. It was different this time.“Back in July I was putting up posters and two people stopped me in this street and asked if they could invite their neighbours to the meeting,” says Rock. “Having expected 30 people, we got 100.”That was just the start. Lahart estimates that about 1,200 people attended meetings he organised in his Dublin South West constituency over a 2½-week period.Thousands more have attended meetings organised by inidual politicians and the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for the €2 billion upgrade.The BusConnects project is a key part of the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan, and it is also envisaged that it will be extended to Cork and Galway, once Dublin is under way.It has two major elements in Dublin. The first is the redesign of the bus network, which would see the existing system replaced with new routes built around seven cross-city, high-frequency spines.New orbital routes will also be introduced around the city, and measures such as a single ticket charge for one 90-minute journey across bus, rail and Luas have been widely welcomed.However, the most contentious elements include some areas of greater Dublin being left without a direct link to the city centre, and concern that increased transfers between services will affect the elderly and disabled as well as causing greater worry for parents who send their children to school on public transport.The re-routing of services has also led to concern, and a debate on a Fianna Fáil motion on BusConnects in the Dáil this week was almost a roll call of every route in the capital, and how certain areas would be affected.One example was Aengus Ó Snodaigh, the Sinn Féin TD for Dublin South Central, who says that “under BusConnects no buses will go through the heart of Drimnagh”.The NTA opened a public consultation process on the network redesign in July, which led to the huge public interest. It closes next week and an updated plan will be published in the new year, and will then be opened for further consultation.Consultation on the second aspect, which will see infrastructure upgrades on 16 key routes, begins next month. This envisages the compulsory purchase of some private gardens to widen roads for buses and cyclists.It is widely agreed that the bus system in Dublin needs improvement to meet current and future demand, and those outside the political sphere suspect BusConnects is being used as a platform for candidates ahead of local elections, and possibly a general election, within the next year.David O’Connor, a senior lecturer in transport planning at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), says there are some public representatives trying to make BusConnects work, but others “getting on the bandwagon and rattling the cage”.“There are representatives out there who are possibly getting a lot of political gain for it. They are calling meetings and the meetings are stuffed. That is a problem for people who are trying to get the project through.”However, O’Connor says there is a case for introducing community bus services alongside BusConnects to ensure that those who need to go, for example, to hospitals are still able to do so.Rock says it is not the case that BusConnects provides a platform for political promotion, and says there is a “proper, legitimate grassroots type of support against this”.“I think there is a way of improving the bus network without upending the existing network,” he says, adding that the envisaged method of hopping between buses to get to your destination will double the chances of people getting stuck on their commute.During the Dáil debate, Fianna Fáil – via both veiled and blunt criticism – was mentioned by other deputies as using the issue to promote its candidates. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan accused Fianna Fáil of wanting to throw out BusConnects, then “reverse and start all over again”. Minister for Transport Shane Ross accused Lahart and Fianna Fáil of being in favour of the proposal initially.Lahart rejects such charges and says BusConnects would be more acceptable if the infrastructural upgrades to bus lanes around Dublin were in place first, rather than the current plan of changing the network first. He says his party is in favour of most of the plan, and describes the proposed high-frequency spines as “great”.“The attempt to connect people is disconnecting people and there is just no argument about that. It isn’t about an unwillingness of people to make connections. You’d sell it much easier, if you said the seamless, fully segregated corridor to the city is in place, it’s in place, it is already there.”In response to numerous questions in the Dáil, Ross also insists BusConnects is not preparing for further privatisation.The issue was also a matter of debate at the Fine Gael parliamentary party this week, with almost all Dublin representatives speaking.Fine Gael Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell has accused Minister for Transport Shane Ross of being “disinterested”.O’Connell also claims the plan is lacking in local knowledge, citing the fact that buses will no longer go down Bushy Park Road in Terenure, where Multiple Sclerosis Ireland has its national care centre.“I don’t see any evidence of any sort of local knowledge of consideration of local issues, like those things I pointed out. As public reps, when we see obvious omissions or things that weren’t considered, I get concerned about the whole plan.“Because it is so complicated and you have to know the buses, it is a bullshitter’s paradise as well. Because the maps are so complicated, it is easy to whip up fear.”In a hyper local electoral system, such local concerns will always draw the attention of politicians. A discussion at Cabinet this week on the Fianna Fáil motion also saw some Ministers hold forth on services and routes in their constituencies.There are different views on how dangerous it is for Government politicians. One Opposition TD, who has been outspoken on BusConnects, says, politically, it is not “catastrophically big”.“It can be managed, but Fine Gael just shit themselves and are over-sensitive.”Yet politicians will never look at an issue that attracts thousands of people to usually poorly attended meetings in the draughty corners of community halls and not see electoral gold, or catastrophe.“With the local elections in six months’ time, in each of the estates in every constituency, you can feel 200, 300 votes leaking through your hands,” says one TD. “It is the guts of a ‘keep our buses’ candidate in every ward in Dublin and could cost you in a general election, if it is marginal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3638466.1537604962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk foreign secretary says eu needs to step back from the abyss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote talks.  Photograph: Ye Aung ThuAPUK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged EU leaders to “step back from the abyss” of a no-deal Brexit and to engage with Theresa May’s Chequers plan.Following the angry clashes of the Salzburg summit, Mr Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote and to say the only way the UK could legally leave was by “breaking up your country”.“What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”Mr Hunt warned there would be “disruption” on both sides of the Channel in the event of a disorderly Brexit, with one estimate suggesting a million jobs could be lost across the EU. “What Theresa May is saying is ‘Don’t mistake British politeness for weakness. If you put us in a difficult corner we will stand our ground. That is the kind of country we are,‘” he told the Today programme. “Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.” Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect that the Government could now seek a simple, Canada-style free trade agreement — as many Tory MPs want rather than the more ambitious Chequers plan. “I am not dismissing anything,” he said. “We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because they work better on the Northern Irish border.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

north korean officials having hands pockets","story":"The two-part documentary, \u0026#39Michael Palin in North Korea\u0026#39, will air on Channel 5 on Thursday 20 September at 9pm.Michael Palin had to reshoot scenes for his North Korea documentary because he had his hands in his pockets, which was seen as “disrespectful”.The Monty Python star irked officials during the first day of filming Michael Palin in North Korea when his hands became obscured as he spoke to camera in front of two statues of the country\u0027s former leaders.Palin said the production crew was ordered by guides to do a retake of the scene because the act is considered disrespectful by North Koreans in the presence of monuments.The 75-year-old was granted unprecedented access to explore the secretive nation, which is long known for its mistrust of the west, for the Channel 5 documentary.In an interview with the Radio Times, Palin said: Because we were in front of the monuments of the two great leaders and there are various rules there and the leaders have to be filmed in their entirety, and so you have to stand a long way back so you can film the full length of them.“And in the end they said no, no, no, You have got to do it again because you had your hand in your pocket and that is disrespectful, so that was interesting.”Palin and the production team  flew out just after a thawing in relations within the Korean peninsula.Palin also said minders had specified that any signs of litter and people in vest tops were to banned from the final cut.Despite the fact that the veteran traveller has roamed the world for more than 30 years, Palin admitted that he was still “very,very cautious” about visiting North Korea amid fears over its highly criticised nuclear weapons programme.He said he eventually decided to go ahead with the project following the historic handshake between North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and South Korea\u0027s President Moon Jae-In in April ,which signalled the beginnings of a truce between the two nations.ITN had been in negotiations with North Korean officials for two years prior to filming and received help from British academic Nick Bonner, whose company Koryo Tours facilitates visitors to explore the country.Mr Bonner, who is credited as the documentary\u0027s associate producer, said travellers are advised on what actions could cause offence before stepping foot in North Korea.The Monty Python star was told off by officials who objected to him holding his hands in his pockets in front of statues of their former leaders.He said: “We give briefings to tourists before they go the country and as with any country you visit it is important not to show disrespect. If you dress badly and acted insensitively it is most likely you would be tolerated but your Korean guide would be made responsible for your behaviour.” Dr Robert Winstanley-Chesters, a lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Leeds, explained tourists to North Korea are expected to show respect to all imagery concerning leadership.He said: “North Koreans are meant to be deeply committed to the ideology and historiography of the state and whether or not they actually believe this in their hearts and minds and expected to demonstrate this and will demonstrate this in their everyday lives.“North Korean\u0027s express great commitment, loyalty and love to the Great, Dear and Young Leaders and whole hearted belief in the \u0027fact\u0027 that North Korea is the greatest country on earth.”His advice to visiting Britons tourists is: “Be respectful to all images of the North Korean leadership, whether statues or images, only take photographs when you are told it is okay to take photographs and do not under any circumstances try to sneak photographs of things you aren\u0027t supposed to.”North Korea | How to avoid causing offenceChannel 5\u0027s Michael Palin in North Korea concludes on Thursday at 9pm.Strictly Come Dancing 2018,

studies concluded that the tax is clogging up the housing marketScrapping stamp duty would be cost neutral as homeowners would spend more on home improvements, a former Tory treasurer has said.   Speaking to the Sunday , Lord Stanley Fink, who is one of the Conservative\u0027s biggest donors, said high stamp duty bills are prohibiting even wealthy home movers from spending money on furniture, home decor and extensions.  Scrapping or cutting stamp duty on home purchases would lead to a rise in such spending, he said, resulting in a loss-cancelling boost for the Treasury from a bigger tax take via the home improvements industry.  This newspaper is campaigning for the Government to cut stamp duty after a number of studies concluded that the tax is clogging up the housing market. One report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found stamp duty is preventing 45,000 house purchases a year, including families with children who need bigger homes.Following pressure the Chancellor used his last Budget to help first-time buyers get a foot on the ladder via a stamp duty break on purchases up to £500,000.For other buyers stamp duty is still paid at 2 per cent on the value of homes purchased between £125,000 and £250,000, 5 per cent between £250,001 and £925,000, ten per cent up to £1.5 million and 12 per cent above this level.   Lord Stanley Fink is investing millions in energy efficient modular housingHistorically when people bought at the top end they tend to spend money on their homes through improvements - new carpets, new kitchens - people want it to be right. It is one of the few expenses and areas of the economy which stays domestic, which means the tax on this industry goes back to the Government, so by cutting stamp duty it would not lose out. I do believe that if the Treasury found that because of stamp duty transactions were drying up significantly - they would want to cut it. But anything that\u0027s seen to be a tax break to the rich is going to be hard to implement, especially in the current climate. Meanwhile Lord Fink has invested more than £3m in modular home developer, Project Etopia, which claims to shave up to 25 per cent of the cost of building homes by using a flat-pack style construction technique.  The homes are also super energy efficient, meaning owners are likely to have very low or non existent energy bills. This is because their homes contain solar panels capable of generating more energy than the home uses. If such homes catch on it could allow the Government to extend its annual house building targets as they can be built in just four weeks, compared to several months for a standard brick house. Strictly Come Dancing 2018, first live show: Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer tied at top, Susannah Constantine stranded at bottomKilling Eve, episode two, review: this blend of comedy and thrills proved irresistibleComment: Theresa May should tear up a £39 billion cheque at the Tory conferenceLabour plans holiday home tax raid and the return of council rates Holocaust campaigner files complaint claiming Labour Party is hostile to Jews Tory donor threatens to fund breakaway Brexit party to \u0026#39deliver\u0026#39 on EU referendumComment: Leave voters are being heated up slowly like laboratory frogsComment: The one solution that would be fatal for British politics is for the UK to leave in any substantial way as a rule takerKavanaugh accuser agrees to testify before Senate next weekOfficial MI5 historian says he has no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn as a Prime MinisterJohn McDonnell backs changes to strike laws which could see Britain \u0026#39return to \u0026#3970s chaos\u0026#39 Animal rights activists hail \u0026#39cull company\u0026#39 leak a breakthrough as badger traps are destroyedBritish pharmacist suspected of fighting for Islamic State detained by Kurdish forces in SyriaProfessor who took on cheats is forced to flee Papua New Guinea universityLocked away until 2034, secrets of woman who fed John Betjeman\u0026#39s soulBritain\u0026#39s first official female doctor revealed as Alice LeeversComment: Forget about trains: we must embrace the car revolution and invest in roadsDyson hoovers up fortune from vacuum cleaner makerBattle of Bosworth battlefield could turn into driverless car test trackLost Henry VIII tapestry rediscovered in Spain to go on display for first timeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/21/TELEMMGLPICT000175195451_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0o1ZLYkgOfOKVvztMyuWGWjR3jAYE0rO-RHQJTgartI.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"suspected peadophile deputy head teacher stranded falklands","story":"Paul Barton has been suspended by the Falkland Islands Community SchoolA teacher who moved his family 8,000 miles to the South Atlantic, after landing a job as deputy head at the Falklands Island school, has been charged with child sex offences.

But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/12/16/sleep-pods.jpg","title":"sleep napping sleeponomics korea sleepology science nap pods sleeping","story":"Created with Sketch.Our technologically-fuelled\u0026nbsplives\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspexhausting us, but they are also\u0026nbspdriving the market of sleep. Jessica Brown investigates whether the commodification of sleep is just a fad, or if the booming industry really can help us get some shut-eyeClick to followThe IndependentPodtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years agoIn these wellness-obsessed times, the tried-and-tested basics of fruit, vegetables, sleep and exercise just aren’t enough anymore.From the moment we wake up and scroll through social media, we’re inundated with ads tempting us with lotions, drinks and devices that promise to make us mentally and physically healthier, many of which have questionable claims. (Detox juices and appetite-suppressing lollipops, I’m looking at you.) \u0026nbspThe latest commodity we’re being persuaded to invest in\u0026nbspis products to help us sleep, fuelled by a booming “sleeponomics”\u0026nbspindustry in a sleep-deprived South Korea. But while it may seem like we’re getting a lot less shut-eye than we used to in the UK, according to most research we’re not getting any less now than we have done in recent history. \u0026nbspIt might feel that way, since we’re\u0026nbspall a lot more anxious and stressed these days, tuned into the blue light of our devices until late at night, and in increasingly demanding jobs where we feel obliged to answer emails 247.Work has a huge role to play in how little sleep we’re getting lines are becoming blurrier between work and home, we’re travelling more and commuting further, and working more overtime –\u0026nbspthe nine\u0026nbspto five\u0026nbspjob feels like a thing of the past.But while technology and work are making us tired, they’re also driving the market for sleep. No longer will a good mattress and some chamomile tea suffice when we can cuddle up to sleep robots, use devices to measure our sleep, assess the lighting and temperature of our bedrooms, and adjust the firmness of our beds – all through an app. \u0026nbspMattresses aren’t just mattresses anymore –\u0026nbspthey’re a lifestyle, and sleep is an industry, targeting everyone from the mildly tired to the insomniacs. London’s even hosting the capital’s only sleep exhibition next month, with consultations and talks dedicated to the art of sleeping well.While some may argue it’s good to have a market for all our sleep ailments, an industry steeped in promises leaves potential for disappointment. And for an industry so lacking regulation, this potential is high. \u0026nbspDreem, a headband that promises to make you go to sleep faster, for example, states on its website it has conducted “internal research”, however, this research doesn’t seem to be published anywhere, and there’s a very slim chance that it’s peer-reviewed.As one research paper published by US-based scientists points out, the most popular consumer sleep technologies, sleep tracking apps worn on the wrist as you sleep and alarm clocks such as Sleep Cycle, may actually cause sleep disruption from noise and light pollution. “Many sleep tracking apps require user activation and device placement on the mattress to monitor sleep,” the paper states. \u0026nbspJournalist Caroline Christie describes herself as a terrible sleeper, and says she stopped using a sleep app after it started making her anxious and reminding her when she was sleep deprived. “It also made me quite competitive, wanting to make sure I kept getting the right numbers of hours,” she says. “I’ve come to accept it all comes down to routine, and doing what it takes to make you feel relaxed and able to switch off.” \u0026nbspThere’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about itAnother concern, the paper states, is the lack of validation studies, FDA approval, and endorsement from American Academy of Sleep Medicine-accredited sleep facilities or sleep specialists. “Practically speaking, lack of validation may be premeditated by some developers, who run the risk of their technology being debunked or labelled inferior if compared to clinical standards,” it states. \u0026nbspAnd in terms of their reliability of measuring sleep or diagnosing sleep disorders, a wrist device hardly compares to the standards of a clinical sleep evaluation\u0026nbspa process which can involve being constantly monitored by technologists, who use\u0026nbspan electrocardiogram\u0026nbspwith more than 20 sensors to record breathing, brain and heart activity over a full night.Christie says, however, that she invested in some products recently to help her sleep\u0026nbspand drown out the sounds of her flatmates –\u0026nbspand they seem to be helping. “About six months ago, I invested in a Bluetooth eye mask that helps me block out surrounding noise and light. Now, it’s part of my sleep routine and helps my body realise it’s time to sleep. It’s comforting, easy to use, and helps me disconnect and drift off.” \u0026nbspShutterstock)However, sleep expert James Wilson, who advises workplaces, sports teams and families on their sleep, describes the market for sleep as “quite superficial,” and the lack of research, he says, has led to some dodgy practices: “There’s lots of snake oil being sold, products making claims they can’t prove. Some of these products have a lot to answer for – they don’t give a solution.”Wilson argues that part of the problem is that the industry doesn’t have a professional body, and needs more science to help people like him become more credible. He spent his teens suffering with insomnia and in work to help others in similar situations, but found a lack of options down an academic route\u0026nbspand started his career working at a charity that supports families with children that have sleeping problems.“There’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about it, I want there to be a practical qualification,” he says.While there are tens of thousands of nutritionists in the UK, there are very few sleep experts, and Wilson argues medical professionals aren’t trained enough to properly recognise and diagnose sleep problems.“Medical students don’t have much sleep knowledge, but sleep is fundamental to life. If you had a condition that meant your body couldn’t take in nutrients, you’d be sent straight to hospital. You can go longer without food than you can with sleep.”Tomorrow\u0027s workplace: How the world will look like in 2030Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Steve Robinson, founder of online shop We Sell Sleep, says while its products comes from research, including the personalised, 45-page sleep report customers can get for £20, a lot also comes from common sense.\u0026nbspSome think his products, including £215 light therapy glasses and magnesium supplements, are a load of nonsense, while others, he says, swear by them – including one customer who said a sleep mist solved his sleep problems. \u0026nbspBut as the industry booms, the science, he argues, will catch up. “The core of sleep science isn’t as evolved as other areas, but people are getting more obsessed with it, and once something gets commercial, there tends to be more money available for research.”And helping the industry boom, despite evidence suggesting work is the biggest stressor keeping us awake at night, are workplaces. Nap pod manufacturer Podtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years ago, predominantly to employers including Facebook and Nestle, whom director Paul Grindrod says are slowly coming around to the idea of napping on the job. \u0026nbspBut it took a while the company didn’t sell a single pod in its first few years, and one local authority cancelled its order with Podtime on the request of its ruling authority due to the stigma attached to napping at work. “We’re gradually overcoming this resistance, as people see the benefits to productivity.There was a time when office buildings didn’t have showers, but now many do,” he says. Grindrod, who likes to read his Kindle inside the pod, says the company doesn’t hire any scientists or commission any research, and tells clients to go online to see the benefits of sleep more generally.\u0026nbspBCIT) in Vancouver, Canada (Alamy)Wilson, however, says installing nap pods is “one of the worst things you can do,” and can exacerbate insomnia. “We have two internal systems that manage sleep: light and dark, and our internal sleep pressure, which counts down to bedtime from the moment we wake up,” he says.“Naps knock bedtime back. Using a nap pod sounds like the right thing to do, and people are doing it because they don’t know any better, but it’s not right for everyone”.Wilson argues that this is why a lot of the advice on sleep isn’t relevant – because it comes down to each inidual and how they sleep best. Headlines warning us that too little sleep causes almost every health problem under the sun aren’t helpful either, he argues, because one of the biggest reasons we can’t sleep is stress.One in seven of British couples prefer to sleep in separate bedsBad night’s sleep makes you fat and weak, study showsWhat happens when you try to catch up on sleep over the weekend“Warnings about how bad sleep is killing us means we wake up stressed in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. We need to get people more relaxed about sleep,” he says. While it’s a nice sentiment, the booming sleep industry is likely to keep insisting there’s a problem to solve, especially if the beauty industry and the “help”\u0026nbspit offers consumers to “fix”\u0026nbspblackheads and cellulite, is anything to go by.Robinson likens the quality of our sleep to the efforts we put into other areas of life:\u0026nbsp“You could be fanatical about it and see a big improvement, or you can make some small differences and see some improvements. It’s the same as diet and exercise, it comes with a level of discipline.”The difference is, however, being sold the idea that we can solve our sleep problems with just a bit of effort and a lot of cash is deceiving. While we can all take steps to help us, it’s unlikely that a pillow mist or 20 minutes in a nap pod at work will cure a sleep disorder, and companies telling us they can will only make us more stressed out when we’re wide awake at 4am.

He could not, therefore, enjoy the “privileges and immunities under the Vienna Convention” that would allow him to leave the country.The WikiLeaks founder has been in self-imposed confinement inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London for the past six years to avoid arrest by British authorities on charges of skipping bail. Ecuador granted him citizenship last year.Earlier this week, the Associated Press obtained a 2010 letter it claimed was written by Mr Assange to the Russian embassy in London asking for a Russian visa.WikiLeaks denied on Twitter that Mr Assange had ever applied for the visa.In 2017, US intelligence agencies revealed they believed WikiLeaks was used as an intermediary by Russia to publish hacked emails from leading figures in the Democratic Party.And in July this year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Russian hackers had sent Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks.The accusation was made as part of an indictment of a dozen Russian GRU military intelligence officers who allegedly hacked party servers.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/01/05/23/Miliband.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/01/05/23/Miliband.jpg","title":"brexit eu negotiations latest canada style trade deal jeremy hunt","story":"Created with Sketch.Foreign secretary refuses to dismiss suggestion government could settle for less comprehensive agreementClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Hunt said the EU’s position had an ‘inherent unreasonableness’Brexit: Jeremy Hunt hints UK could accept Canada-style trade deal if EU rejects Chequers planJeremy Hunt has signalled that the UK could now accept a Canada-style free trade agreement from Brussels as it quits the EU.The foreign secretary refused to rule out taking such a deal, which has been advocated by Theresa\u0026nbspMay’s rivals such as David Davis and Boris Johnson, but said the government preferred to try to make the prime minister’s Chequers\u0026nbspproposals viable.It comes after a major row with EU leaders over her proposals for Brexit, which have also been attacked by Tory MPs.On Thursday, European Council president Donald Tusk said Ms May’s plan “will not work”, prompting the prime minister to deliver a stern Downing Street statement demanding the EU treat the UK “with respect”.Mr Hunt insisted the government was still focused on winning support for the Chequers plan, but did not rule out a Canada-style deal if that fails.“I am not dismissing anything,”\u0026nbsphe told BBC Radio 4’s Today when asked about the potential for a Canada-type model.But he added: “We have been very clear that we are prepared to negotiate on the Chequers proposal but we can’t talk to a void – we have to have a counter party that’s prepared to sit down and go through the details.“We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because of the fact that they work better on the Northern Irish border. That’s the main reason we came up with them.”The deal agreed between Canada and the EU covers free trade but is significantly less comprehensive than the arrangement Britain is seeking with the EU.A Canada-style deal is favoured by some Brexiteers because it would not keep Britain so closely aligned with the EU.Mr Hunt attacked European leaders for the “inherent unreasonableness” of their negotiating position, saying it was “unacceptable” and a “parody” of an institution that claimed to respect democracy.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchBut despite talks being deadlocked, he said he had received messages from two EU foreign ministers following the Salzburg summit earlier this week saying they believed a deal was still possible, and that Mr Tusk had expressed the same view.He said: “What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”On Friday, Ms May warned EU leaders she would not accept any solution that would create a new customs border in the Irish Sea.She said the EU plan was “something I will never agree to” and something “no British prime minister would ever agree to”.Saying she had always treated the UK with respect, she said the “UK expects the same” and called on EU leaders to explain “what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them”.May labels EU conduct ‘unacceptable’ and demands respect for UKPound sterling slumps as Theresa May admits Brexit ‘impasse’ All the times the EU has said ‘no’ to Theresa May’s Brexit planBrexit: Labour could surge towards power backing new vote, polls findShe was speaking after Mr Tusk poked fun at the prime minister by tweeting a photo of him offering her cake, alongside the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps?

The truth is that waiting for the government to foul up is no strategy at all. The country desperately needs a strong government but it also need a strong opposition.“Labour’s tragedy over 20 years – and I include my own period in this – is that there was almost a complacency about Europe. The Tory tragedy was to be obsessed about Europe and the Labour tragedy was to be complacent about Europe.”He added: “Finally the complacency is breaking, at least at the constituency level of the Labour Party, but it’s an absolute dereliction of duty for the Labour Party leadership not to embrace the fundamental principle that since the Brexit that people were sold two years ago is not available, it’s essential that the Brexit deal the prime minister does is put to people.“The most corrosive thing in the long term will be a Brexit on terms that were missold.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Miliband predicted Ms May would “eke out” a “paper-thin deal” with Brussels and then “use the threat of no deal and the disaster that represents to try to bludgeon people to support it”.He said: “No-deal is obviously a terrible disaster for the country.“Theresa May has painted herself and painted the country into a corner.

We’ve been very clear about it.”Ms Butler said Labour wanted to see a general election rather than another referendum.She said: “Our priority is making sure that we are not worse off – that we have a jobs-first Brexit, that we protect the rights of people in our country and services for people in our country.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/15/17/theresa-may-000.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/15/17/theresa-may-000.jpg","title":"labour early election theresa may brexit deal jeremy corbyn negotiations","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Party chiefs believe a collapse in Brexit talks would be a moment of maximum weakness for the prime ministerClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn and his allies have made no secret of their desire for a new election, but this is the first time shadow ministers have set out how it might be achievedLabour plan to trigger early election \u0027within days\u0027 if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is defeated in parliamentLabour will launch a plan to force an election by seeking a motion of no confidence in the government within days if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is defeated in parliament,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas learnt.Jeremy Corbyn and his top team will launch an attempt to force the Conservative administration to go to the people at what they believe will be a moment of maximum weakness for the prime minister.Multiple sources confirmed party chiefs have game-planned their approach if Ms May’s beleaguered proposals are vetoed in a crucial commons vote or if she fails to get a deal in Europe, which looks increasingly likely after EU leaders torpedoed them earlier this week.A motion of no confidence would need some support from Conservative MPs to pass, but either way would act to severely destabilise the prime minister as internal pressure for her to quit peaked.The moment could also prove critical for Labour’s own approach to Brexit, with the party having stated its preference for an election while signalling that if one is not possible it could back a new referendum.It comes as Labour starts its 2018 conference in Liverpool, with Brexit and the party’s approach to holding a fresh public vote on the outcome of negotiations set to dominate the agenda.Mr Corbyn and his allies have up to now made no secret of their desire for a new election, but it is the first time that those in the shadow cabinet have set out how they would begin to push for an election immediately if a major Brexit crisis engulfs Ms May.A senior Labour source said: “If Theresa May’s deal is voted down in parliament, then expect to see Labour come forward with a vote of no confidence within days.“The party has always been clear that an election is needed, and we would push for that hard and immediately.”If Theresa May’s deal is voted down in parliament, then expect to see Labour come forward with a vote of no confidence within daysUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act passed during the coalition years, there are only two routes to securing an election outside of the allotted date every five years.The first is if a motion for an early general election is agreed either by at least two-thirds of the whole House of Commons or passed without disagreement. The second, said to be favoured by Labour strategists, is the motion of no confidence.The wording of the motion is set out in the 2011 legislation, meaning MPs would simply be asked to vote that “this house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s government”.PMQs: Jeremy Corbyn accuses the government of being ‘too busy fighting with each other’ to negotiate BrexitIf it the motion passes by a simple majority, then a 14-day countdown would begin during which there is a window for another government to be formed.If one can be, it would need approval from the Commons\u0026nbspbut if one cannot, then an election takes place.Jeremy Hunt hints UK could accept Canada-style trade dealDavid Miliband accuses Labour of ‘dereliction of duty’ over BrexitEuropean Court should say if UK can stop Brexit, Scottish judges ruleMay labels EU conduct ‘unacceptable’ and demands respect for UKTheresa May’s Brexit speech in fullPM demands new ideas from Brussels after EU rejects her plan- LIVEA member of the shadow cabinet told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “There are two things that you have to separate out:\u0026nbspMay’s position and that of the government.“If her deal is voted down or there is no deal, then May could go, but the government may try to continue on, but I think that’s going to be very difficult for them. Pressure for an election would mount.“So it is true to say that we would act very quickly as an opposition in trying to bring forward a motion no confidence, and that only requires a simple majority.”A source in Mr Corbyn’s leadership team confirmed that bringing a quick motion of no confidence was a plan the party was looking at, but said there were other options to try and force an election as well.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIf a motion is to succeed it would need some support from Tory MPs, which is a stumbling block given many Conservatives are fearful of losing their seats and allowing Mr Corbyn the opportunity to take power.But the move would be a clear signal of intent from the opposition and would, following a collapse in Brexit talks, come at time when the number of Conservative MPs exasperated with Ms May could easily outnumber her majority. \u0026nbspA Tory rebel move to replace Ms May with a new leader without holding an election, meanwhile, could prove electorally toxic for an incoming Tory leader.Polls show a majority – some 51 per cent of the public – wanting a new election if Ms May is replaced in a Conservative coup. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShadow chancellor John McDonnell confirmed earlier this week that if the party cannot get an election then backing a second referendum would be an option for the party.He said in a webchat with users of the Mumsnet website: “Our position is that any Brexit deal negotiated has to protect our economy and jobs.“My view, then, is that we should have a general election because, in a general election, people can not only debate the range of issues in full, they can also select the team that will then negotiate our future position. If we can’t get a general election, we are keeping the option of another vote – a people’s vote – on the table.”At the conference this week more than 100 constituency Labour branches have submitted motions calling for the party to back a referendum on any final Brexit deal, with some kind of motion likely to be voted on.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/18/may-angry.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 21 September 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/18/may-angry.jpg","title":"nationalise railways labour john mcdonnell renationalise public transport","story":"Created with Sketch.Shadow chancellor wants public ownership ‘within the first term of a Labour government’Click to followIndy PoliticsLabour \u0027could nationalise railways in five years\u0027, John McDonnell claimsA Labour government would try to nationalise Britain’s entire rail network within the first five years of taking office, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.Mr McDonnell said his party was examining railway franchise contracts in detail to figure out how quickly the plan could be achieved.Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto promised to bring back private railway companies into public ownership as current franchises expire.Brexit: Labour could surge towards power backing new vote, polls findCorbyn ‘faces election disadvantage if policies seen as too extreme’Why Labour might be right with its call for new gambling regulations Speaking ahead of the Labour conference in Liverpool, the shadow chancellor suggested a Labour government could take advantage of break clauses to act earlier than previously thought.Asked whether\u0026nbspthe whole network could be publicly owned in one five-year term, Mr McDonnell said: “I think that’s possible.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg","title":"china uighurs human rights muslims orphanages xinjiang province reeducation","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It’s like my kids are in jail,’\u0026nbspsays 29-year-old mother living in exileStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentChina is putting Uighur children in \u0027orphanages\u0027 even if their parents are aliveChinese authorities are putting the children of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups into dozens of state-run orphanages across the western Xinjiang region even if their parents are not dead, as some 1 million adults in their families are sent to internment camps.The orphanages are the most recent manifestation of Beijing’s efforts to systematically distance young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture. Uighurs fear such efforts are erasing their ethnic identity, one child at a time.\u0026nbspIn Istanbul,\u0026nbspa dozen Uighur families spoke to reporters during the Muslim holy festival Eid al-Adha, which comes with large family reunions. Tables in every home were resplendent with traditional Xinjiang dishes like homemade noodles, freshly butchered lamb and crispy naan.\u0026nbspBut the Uighurs who fled China to avoid detention described the\u0026nbsppainful absence of the children they left behind – who they believe are now in the hands of the very government tearing their families apart.\u0026nbspSome did not want their full names used for fear of retribution against relatives still in Xinjiang.Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: the Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.\u0026nbspMeripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, that\u0026nbspvisit became exile.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspher mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her offspring, aged between three and eight,\u0026nbsphad been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region\u0026nbspunder the care of the state that broke up her family.\u0026nbsp“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”\u0026nbspMeripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up by President Xi Jinping‘s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The UK Foreign Office also believes Beijing has “introduced intrusive security and surveillance measures and cultural restrictions” aimed at the Uighur people, including “re-education camps”.Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.\u0026nbspThe institutions are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture,\u0026nbspinterviews with more than a dozen people and a review of procurement documents suggest. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalised for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in one Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of five.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the US, Canada and Australia treated indigenous children – policies that have left generations traumatised.\u0026nbsp“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”\u0026nbspFor Meripet, the loss is agony it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.\u0026nbsp“When I finally see them again, will they even recognise me?” she asked. “Will I recognise them?”\u0026nbspWhen Mr Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, he\u0026nbsphas overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.\u0026nbspChen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as the internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education”. Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.\u0026nbspThe camps are among the most troubling aspects of Mr Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Mr Xi’s call to “Sinicise” religion across the country have shut underground churches, burnt\u0026nbspBibles, replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of the president, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.\u0026nbspIn Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, reporters interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.\u0026nbspThe families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.\u0026nbspSome interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.\u0026nbspThe regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centres to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. A review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30m\u0026nbsp(200 million Chinese yuan, £22.7m) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as “welfare centres” and “protection centres”, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.\u0026nbspIn July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centres for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minority groups. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 sq\u0026nbspmetres in size – bigger than three\u0026nbspfootball pitches.\u0026nbspThese numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.\u0026nbspShi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, said that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents”. But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centres.\u0026nbspA friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.\u0026nbspThe school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland”, say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.\u0026nbspThe principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told reporters that the institution was “just a normal kindergarten”. But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.\u0026nbspGu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on the scene, added: “There are really young kids here – some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”\u0026nbspHotan City Kindness Kindergarten (AP)A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children aged six and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons”.\u0026nbsp“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24m had been invested in the kindergarten.\u0026nbspSatellite imagery shows that the kindergarten had been constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens taught children “civilised living habits”.\u0026nbsp“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.\u0026nbspLife in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\u0026nbsp“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”\u0026nbspMeripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education centre in June 2017.\u0026nbspAziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbours had already been taken away to re-education centres or prison, he said.\u0026nbspNow the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.\u0026nbsp“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

The election was the first since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup last year, and featured a close race between Mnangagwa and opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC Alliance). Deadly clashes broke out earlier in the week following the release of parliamentary election results, amid allegations of fraud by Chamisa and MDC supportersThe Chinese government says all 2.9 million students attending compulsory elementary and junior high school in Xinjiang will receive Mandarin instruction by this month, up from just 39 per cent in 2016.\u0026nbspEven preschoolers are steeped in the language. A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.\u0026nbspLike all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China”, the teacher said.\u0026nbspDilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.\u0026nbspHer seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.\u0026nbspSome bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programmes that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.\u0026nbspThe Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs say they do not want their culture erased.\u0026nbspGulzar Seley, who was detained in China along with her newborn son, is placed on a table in the home of her husband Halmurat Idris in Istanbul (AP)“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.\u0026nbspAdil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Monday\u0026nbspthrough Friday instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step towards extinguishing Kazakh culture.\u0026nbspA Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was nine\u0026nbspyears old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.\u0026nbsp“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.\u0026nbspDilnur said her neighbours too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them sweets through a fence.\u0026nbsp“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity ... toward a national identity.”\u0026nbspA government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately – even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland”, and avoid the “75 types of behaviour that show religious extremism”. Such behaviour ranges from calling for “holy war” to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.\u0026nbspChina insists it guarantees\u0026nbspfreedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may begin to criticise their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.\u0026nbsp“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room – an indication of the programme’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.\u0026nbspAbdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter had been sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When reporters visited what appeared to be his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.\u0026nbspYet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard”. Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.\u0026nbspA historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move towards boarding schools brought to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.\u0026nbsp“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.\u0026nbsp“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”\u0026nbspIn December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.\u0026nbspImin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of them had been killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in prison. He does not know where the other two are.\u0026nbspFeeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:\u0026nbsp“I will go... to tear down your dark, endless night ...\u0026nbspI will go, to embrace again my hometown ...\u0026nbspI will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”\u0026nbspElsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children.\u0026nbspShe flipped through the photographs she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest Adile, her only daughter and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light”.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope – I know one day I will see my children again.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/22/18/imran-khan-saudi.jpg","title":"pakistan saudi arabia imran khan china belt road infrastructure project","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentSaudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud receives Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan in JeddahIslamabad has invited Saudi Arabia to become the third partner in the Beijing-funded Belt and Road corridor of major infrastructure projects inside Pakistan.The announcement comes on the back of a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia by new prime minister Imran Khan, who had been expected to push for financial assistance from Islamabad\u0027s ally to help Pakistan deal with a brewing currency crisis.Information minister Fawad Chaudhry did not reveal if Saudi Arabia would be loaning money to Pakistan to help top up its dwindling foreign currency reserves, but said he expected Saudi Arabia to invest in Pakistan in a major way.Saudi Arabia is the first country whom we have invited as third country partner in CPEC, Chaudhry said, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Pakistan leg of China\u0027s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.Beijing has pledged $60bn\u0026nbspto build power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world.Mr Chaudhry said a Saudi delegation will be coming to Pakistan in the first week of October, including the Saudi minister for finance and energy, and that should lay down a foundation for a very big partnership.God willing, very big investments will be coming to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia this way, he added.Mr Khan\u0027s term began with new doubt over the CPEC projects, when his commerce minister was quoted as saying Pakistan would suspend them for a year and review them. The minister later said his comments were taken out of context, and Pakistani officials reassured Beijing there would be no delay.World news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

They showed me what really matters: loving others and loving life itself.The story of his journey to handrear the greylag geese in order to study them in flight is as heartwarming as it is surprising - particularly to Quetting himself.I didn\u0027t expect to become so attached to them, he says. I didn\u0027t expect to learn anything from them. I thought I would be teaching them, not the other way around.                We face mass extinctions in our back yard says TV Chris Packham                Gannets display shows the magic of nature, writes JOHN INGHAM Quetting spent a year caring for the goslings as they hatched, helping them learn to swim, and teaching them to fly alongside his Ultralight aircraft as part of an ambitious research programme undertaken by the Max Planck Institute in Germany to analyse animal movement on Earth.The goslings had to undergo imprinting, by which they would identify their human  as their parent and follow his lead.Baby geese aren\u0027t picky about choosing their parents, says Quetting.They latch on to whatever they first see after hatching: a human, a doll or even a football.Quetting and his brood take a rest but the adventurous Nemo is eager for another dip (Image: PR)But the work starts before the chicks have even hatched so it was important for him to spend as much time with the large white eggs as possible.The chicks have to be encouraged to hatch so the incubator they used was designed to mimic the brooding process - even down to Quetting taking the eggs out to cool every day for half an hour, before misting them with cold water to replicate conditions in the wild when the mother would leave the nest briefly to take a dip, and return with a wet bottom.He soon developed a strong bond with the unhatched chicks. I read them stories while they were still in the egg, he says.This was part of a scientific experiment, to ensure the chicks recognised me from the moment they were born and adopted me as their mother.The goal was for the geese, when fully grown, to wear small data loggers on their backs, which would transmit to ICARUS - International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space. The ICARUS antennae were placed on the outside of the International Space Station last month by two Russian cosmonauts.The geese take flight with \u0026lsquoPapa\u0026rsquo in his Ultralight (Image: PR)Using tiny transmitters, ICARUS will analyse wildlife movement and track bird migration and habitat shifts in response to climate. The data will also provide real-time weather updates so, for example, a sailor in the Atlantic can change course if a storm is coming, explains Quetting.As the day of hatching approached, he grew as nervous as any prospective parent. At my daughter\u0027s insistence, he says, I named the firstborn gosling Gloria - mistaking him for a girl goose.As with a newborn baby, the first physical contact is critical, so Michael gently cuddled Gloria and whispered his best goose noises: Gagagaga! Weeweeweeweewee!When the goslings were all hatched, he moved into a trailer in the grounds of the Max Planck Institute, dubbed Duckingham Palace, with his brood: Gloria - by now renamed Glorio - Paul, Freddy, Nemo, Maddin. Nils and Calimero.Quetting initially believed he had three girls and four boys until DNA tests revealed an all-boy lineup.No sooner had he safely hatched all the chicks than it was time to get on with a few crucial life lessons, starting with swimming.                SNOW IN AFRICA: Giraffes, elephants and antelopes covered in snow                 Playful dolphin\u0026rsquos baby has whale of a timeI was up at 5.15am as usual - the goslings gave me no choice - and put out a paddling pool, he recalls.Nemo was first to jump in but soon all the chicks were frolicking happily, splashing and playing submarines.Next came running and playing follow-my-leader, a game the goslings took to with ease.They raced after me like seven little golden tennis balls, writes Quetting in his book - which came about after media coverage of his daily blog brought this heartwarming tale to the attention of publishers Random House.It warmed my heart to see them running with their stubby wings outstretched, eager to be reunited with their Papa Goose.While the goslings were losing their baby down and learning new skills every day, Quetting, too, was undergoing a change.Michael Quetting accompany them in his light aircraft (Image: PR)Thanks to the geese, I was finding it easier to accept that, following my orce, I wasn\u0027t able to see my own children all the time, he says, a reference to his daughter Amelia, 13, and son Ronin, nine.The geese taught me to live in the moment, not the past or the future. I also turned my back on the internet, I stopped checking my phone all the time, as we humans do, and I didn\u0027t miss it. I felt at one with the geese and I felt happy and calm.There was a day of reckoning when Quetting decided to find out if his hours of encouraging them to fly would enable him to accompany them in his light aircraft.As his Ultralight soared into the sky, he honked his horn - the signal for the geese to take off - and they took flight, giving him the kind of bird\u0027s eye view that any twitcher would die for.I was surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving heads, says Quetting. I saw close up their goose aerobatics, how they will turn on to their backs in mid-air and e towards the ground before righting themselves. It seems they do it just because they can.His favourite manoeuvre was the landing: almost vertically, no need for a runway, coming down on their feet as gracefully as helicopters.The eggs\u0026rsquo customised incubator (Image: PR)Unlike dogs and cats, geese do not make long-term pets and soon Quetting\u0027s flock began to break up. Freddy, always the most rebellious, was the first to go. He became disobedient and refused to fly with the rest, he says.But he returned and is now seen regularly - with Maddin - at a local boating lake, pestering visitors for scraps of bread.Tragically, Nemo died of a neck injury in the aviary, while Paul flew away one day and was never seen broth-again. Glorio, eldest of the brothers, answered the call of the wild and was last seen in the midst of a group of undomesticated greylags.Calimero and Nils were taken in by a wildlife park and Quetting visits them regularly.I miss the geese every day, he says. But their legacy stays with me. If ever I feel stressed, I recall those days with the goslings and it instantly calms me down. That is the lasting power of the geese which will stay with me for ever.During more than 60 flights together, Quetting gathered enough data for several PhD theses and proved that data loggers can be carried by geese in flight without any hindrance, opening the way for this method to be used by meteorologists all round the world.To order Papa Goose: One Year, Seven Goslings, And The Flight Of My Life by Michael Quetting (Greystone, \u0026pound16.99) call the Express Bookshop on 01872 562310 with your card details.

These efforts have been dismissed out of hand by Theresa May.\u0026ldquoThe British government must understand that negotiating the integrity of the single market is no more acceptable than an inner customs border to the UK.\u0026ldquoThe United Kingdom Government has cornered itself by saying three things, the UK will leave the single market and customs union, second thing, we will accept no hard border in Northern Ireland, and three we will accept no border down the Irish sea.Well, these three things are incompatible with one another, so one of the three has to give.\u0026ldquoI agree that the situation the UK is in is dire, but Theresa May did not have to interpret the referendum as she did in her Lancaster House speech, saying we are getting out of the single market and customs union. There I think, she cornered herself.He went on: \u0026ldquoShe took a stance that made her own job more difficult. I understand her predicament, but at some point, reality will need to sink in.\u0026ldquoI hope we can get over emotions. I spoke to Michel Barnier today and he is in the same mindset as he was before Salzburg: let\u0026rsquos get down to the job and try and find a solution.\u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot feel any anger or special emotion on Michel Barriers side.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US — for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.But her plans were dealt a blow at crunch talks in Salzburg with other EU leaders in September.The PM was ambushed by EU bullies who dismissed her Chequers plan out of hand.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.Once a deal has been agreed —  ever — MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000404126859.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may housing policy election","story":"There are all kinds of answers.A social care policy that went down among elderly Tory voters like a cup of cold novichok.A leader who repeated the phrase “strong and stable” so much the record started to scratch.But the statistics tell a simpler story — they lost it because of HOUSING.The voters who drove Labour’s turnout surge were those who used to be able to own homes, but now can’t.This “rentquake”, according to pollster Matt Singh, was enough to explain 77 per cent of the swing to Labour.These young voters are furious. And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out? You’ll find it in a drawer in your kitchen.They come in rolls for about £1.50 from Asda. Yep, it’s the black bin liner, as sported here by Megan Barton Hanson.I have no idea, incidentally, who Megan Barton Hanson is, still less her boyfriend called “Wes”.BBC Radio 6 presenter Cerys Matthews says she refuses to play music made by people who went to private school.OK, Cerys. That means your entire back catalogue is banned, seeing as you were educated at the expensive St Michael’s School in Llanelli.A few weeks ago a BBC executive said he wouldn’t be commissioning comedies from public schoolboys .Spouting every right-on opinion that suddenly swings into fashion?Here’s a tip, Cerys. Play the best rock, folk and soul music you can find.The stuff that sounds the most interesting.You’ll find that auto- matically the private school musicians will be excluded anyway – including yourself.APPARENTLY President Trump’s penis closely resembles a toadstool.This is according to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Donald.The question is, though – what kind of toadstool?There are hundreds of thousands of species. Was it a fly agaric? That’s the one with a big red head covered in white spots. If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start. What, even  we’ve taken her to a ballet?Also, don’t wring your hands or sit in a slumped manner, and so on.Hmm. As a “relationship expert” I offer the following advice to blokes out on a first date in a restaurant.2. Don’t pass wind then waft the air saying “Mmmmm, Bisto!”3. When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday. I’ll be there. Don’t forget – as Joni Mitchell once sang, you don’t know what you’ve got ’til its gone.SO, it looks very much as  the old Irish border problem is going to be solved very quickly after all.We’re close to agreeing a deal with the European Union which will enable Northern Ireland to retain its “soft border”.The Remainers said it couldn’t be done. Totally impossible. But  we don’t want a hard border and the Irish don’t want a hard border – who is going to make us have one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The annual ­target for new homes is 300,000 — and we doubt even that would lower prices enough for young people to afford to buy in London and the South East.In fairness, the total HAS risen to 217,000 a year, the most since 2007. But it’s still way short — and the Government’s remedies are woefully timid.Sajid Javid promised a huge shake-up when he ran housing. He was knocked back by the negativity from Philip Hammond’s Treasury. Then he moved on.We need to slash planning restrictions and defy obstructive NIMBYs. We need to stop the land-banking that sees developers hoard plots or release homes at a snail’s pace to keep prices high.We need more cash help for small builders. We should borrow billions, build affordable homes on public land and sell them at a profit for the Treasury.The Tories need to wake up or housing will sink them. Instead they are hyping up some footling new funding that only partly reverses a previous cut.It fools no one.WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.FROM child abuse images to terrorism, Facebook is a platform for evil it seems unable or unwilling to prevent.Now it is hosting ads for people- smuggling gangs luring children to their doom in the Mediterranean.A new low, even for a tech giant with apparently no moral compass.Since Facebook now admits it is a publisher, why isn’t it regulated as one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way. Fat chance of that. Throughout this process, the European Union has shown time and time again why more than 17 million people voted to leave.They have refused to negotiate in good faith. They have refused to compromise, even while Britain has worked day-in, day-out to find agreement.They have insulted the Prime Minister, ignored their own citizens, and are willing to accept a massive economic hit for the sake of flexing their muscles.Like all good gangsters, they’re trying to rule by fear. That’s the only weapon in their arsenal on the Continent, where more and more voters are turning against an outfit that increasingly looks more at home in Sicily than Strasbourg.All they have is the chance to punish us, and prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.The message they want to send? You won’t get away with it.Well, Mrs May is right to say that we’ve nothing to be scared of.Yes, it is without doubt that we need to pick up the pace on preparations for a clean-break Brexit.It is vital we show the European Union, who still seem to think we’ll roll over when it really matters, that we are ready for a new future free of their cold, dead hands.And despite no-marks such as Donald Tusk trolling the PM on Instagram, and the puffed-up pomposity of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, we haven’t entirely given up hope that sensible forces within the EU might find their voice in the crucial months to come — and work with the UK, not against it.The Government should be all ears  Brussels makes us an offer that works for both sides.But after yesterday’s performance, we don’t hold out much hope.Brussels has made us an offer it thinks we can’t refuse.Today we join the Prime Minister in saying no.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He sets the timetable and makes decisions over which engines should be scrapped. The problem with today’s railway ­system is that there is nobody who takes on the role.That was made clear in the report by Professor Stephen Glaister, the chairman of the Office Of Rail And Road, into the chaos that paralysed the railways in May following an extensive timetable change.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge. After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time. They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them. If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed. Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period. The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters. In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways. It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution.

CAATSA sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defense capabilities of any particular country, said the officialThey are instead aimed at imposing costs upon Russia in response to its malign activities, the official said.In Moscow, Russian member of parliament Franz Klintsevich said the sanctions would not affect the S-400 and SU-35 contracts.I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule. The possession of this military equipment is very important for China.Collin Koh, a security analyst at Singapores S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the sanctions would do little end the evolving military co-operation between Russia and China."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004357325401.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nasa 12k fee to stay in bed for 70 days how to apply","story":"The space agency will pay the volunteer £12,000 for this mattress-bound mission so they can find out more about the effects of weightlessness on astronauts.  The bed rest study will involve being monitored during sleep.

You need to hurry the f**k up. Everythings got f**ked. Fatima Khan told jurors that she had asked Raza Khan for a loan of a few hundred pounds because she was overdrawn at the bank.She said she panicked when Raza Khan arrived and the fight started and walked off.Asked why she filmed Mr Safi bleeding on the ground, she said: It is so shameful. Its disgusting. It wasnt even directed at Khalid - the message wasnt for him.I was just tired of it, getting assaulted before and him punching me again. I just wrote that so that people didnt try to assault me or harrass me.Her barrister Kerim Fuad, QC, told the court: She may be Ilfords Snapchat Queen. I do not say that to make light of it, but she is another example of a youngster who seems to live her le through the prism of Snapchat.You may think she sees more of le through her phone than with her eyes.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell labelled Fatima Khan “perverse” and “callous”.Speaking after the trial, he said: Fatima used social media to bring about a confrontation between two young men vying for her affection.She lured Khalid to a spot pre-arranged with the suspect who was named in court as Raza Khan.She posted a series of antagonising posts which she knew full well could, at the very least, result in serious harm coming to Khalid.When Khalid lay dying after being stabbed, her first thought was to capture the moment for social media - a truly perverse and callous course of action. Khalid was only 18 years old when he was killed and he had his whole le ahead of him.A petty argument over rival affections has escalated with a tragic outcome. I hope todays conviction gives Khalids family some measure of comfort and closure.A £5,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of Raza Khan is being offered by the independent charity Crimestoppers."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tp-graphic-giant-may-dover.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm theresa may brexit response","story":"In a ­dramatic retaliation to her Salzburg humiliation, the Prime Minister blasted Brussels for a lack of “respect” and making the “fundamental mistake” of underestimating her resolve to keep her Chequers deal alive.Mrs May made a rare live address from No10’s state dining room to vow she will not abandon her soft Brexit offer — despite it being shredded by EU leaders in Austria.Instead she insisted the ball was now in their court to make Chequers work or face No Deal.Sterling later fell by more than one per cent, but Brussels said a compromise was still possible.The PM, seething at her Salzburg slapdown the day before, challenged the EU to come up with a counter proposal to her Chequers offer.In a steely statement from No10, Mrs May hit out: “Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.”She accused the EU of making a “fundamental mistake”  it thought she would agree to any deal that threatened the UK’s integrity.The PM warned: “The EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum.Nor will I break up my country. As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.”After being ambushed in Austria on Thursday, Mrs May said talks were on ice until Brussels engaged on a compromise.She promised alternatives to unblock the Irish border issue ahead of a summit on October 18 — described as the “moment of truth” by European Council President Donald Tusk.But she stood by her Chequers blueprint as “the best way” to get a deal that protects Northern Ireland.She blamed the EU side for failing to explain its objections to Chequers.Mrs May said: “At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and new proposals.”An EU suggestion of keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union and the rest of the UK out was branded “unacceptable” by Mrs May.She added: “We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country”.She pushed the EU for an alternative or face a No Deal.But in a huge U-turn, Mrs May vowed that all three million EU citizens can stay in the UK  talks collapse — regardless of Brussels’ commitments to our expats.Two years ago the PM came under fire for refusing to make such a unilateral commitment – saying it would weaken the UK’s negotiating position.Last night Mr Tusk insisted that Brussels had studied her Chequers plan “in all seriousness”.And he said No10 had been given a full explanation for its rejection.Mr Tusk added: “The results of our analysis have been known to the British side in every detail for many weeks.”He also attacked Mrs May’s pitch at Salzburg as “surprisingly tough”.But he was convinced “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Mr Tusk added: “I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.”France’s Emmanuel Macron outed himself as the key assassin of Mrs May’s Chequers plan at Salzburg.His aides briefed Paris media that during a lunch meeting of the 27 leaders without Mrs May on Thursday he talked round the others into sticking the kne into her.Mr Macron is quoted in Le Figaro newspaper as telling them: “We must be clear now. It is useless to say to each other that the proposals do not work at all, and to say outside that things are not going so badly.Europe is often criticised for going too slowly, we have to go faster.”The UK’s biggest allies at the lunch, Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki and Dutch Premier Mark Rutte, were said to be uncomfortable at further destabilising talks.But their dissent was quickly quashed as Spain’s PM Pedro Sanchez backed Macron, and others followed suit.A No10 source told The Sun: “The PM is livid about how the leaders treated her in Salzburg. It has been a big moment for her.“We have been nothing but courteous and professional to them for a year.“The PM wants them to know that either Brussels grows up and starts acting like adults or there really will be no deal.”In a sly put-down on Thursday, Mr Tusk posted a selfie of him and Mrs May with a cake, captioned: “Sorry, no cherries”.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said Mr Tusk’s post “didn’t feel like very statesman-like behaviour”.Mrs May has always treated EU leaders with respect. But these bullying egomaniacs, these swaggering posers in designer suits, lack the common decency to respect Britain, our Prime Minister and our democratic choice.So yesterday, on behalf of her position and the nation, she bit back. It was the best speech of her le. And her ­arguments were as unassailable as her welcome new tone was hostile.We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions — and make a mockery of the referendum verdict. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate.If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.Mr Raab added: “There’s a big question mark about whether the EU is really serious about the substance of these negotiations.”Last night Mr Tusk insisted that it had been an “innocent gesture” about the EU’s insistence that Britain can not pick and choose the best bits of EU membership.Tory Brexiteers and Irish allies also rallied behind Mrs May yesterday.DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “The Prime Minister is right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union. The United Kingdom will not be treated in such a manner.”Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the PM’s “strong and forthright” tone, but said it was time for her to ditch Chequers and go for a simple Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU.Meanwhile, a blame game erupted over how the PM was blindsided at Salzburg — given some advisers expected her to be greeted with warm words.Brexiteers said aide Olly Robbins, who drew up the Chequers plan, should be sacked for the “duff” intelligence.A senior Eurosceptic told The Sun: “He needs shooting. He has humiliated her.”Iain Duncan Smith added: “It raises serious questions over the advice she has been getting.”But Whitehall insiders claimed that No10 spin chiefs had ignored Mr Robbins’ warnings that Salzburg could go wrong. Is Chequers finished?Unless Brussels agrees to a compromise over the Irish border, Chequers is all but dead in its current form.Downing Street believes the PM has already made enough concessions and it’s now up to Brussels to move.A concession by Brussels could revive Chequers in some form and allow a “fudge” at EU summits in October and November.Why don’t we just walk away?Theresa May could end talks and say Britain is leaving in March without a deal, saving £39billion and falling back on tarfs set by the World Trade Organisation.But it is said to terry the PM as well as business chiefs given the likely chaos to their supply chains and logjams at the border.Is there another option?Arch Brexiteers want Britain to pursue a Canada-style free trade deal with Brussels.But Downing Street doesn’t believe it solves the Irish border issue and business doesn’t like it because it means Britain will sit outside the customs union.Europhile MPs want a Norway-style option, keeping Britain in the European Economic Area.But this signs the UK up to the single market and means we have to accept unlimited EU immigration.Is a second referendum likely?Theresa May has categorically ruled one out.But it could happen  the Speaker allows a “Meaningful Vote” on Brexit to be amended in the Commons by MPs — giving them the chance to force a new poll on the Government.Could we have a General Election next year?The horror show at Salzburg cut the odds of a snap poll, but it will need a catastrophic chain of events to trigger one.Theresa May would have to lose a confidence vote in the Commons and see a majority of MPs vote to go to the polls.Labour insist a General Election is their No1 objective, which is enough to make Tory MPs think twice before bringing down their leader.YESTERDAY, I was in Salzburg for talks with European leaders.I’ve always said these negotiations would be tough — and were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that — despite the progress we’ve made — there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart.The first is our economic relationship after we have left. Here, the EU is still only offering us two options.The first would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU.In plain English, this means we’d still have to abide by EU rules, uncontrolled immigration would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries.That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border.But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.Parliament has already, unanimously, rejected this idea.Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK, in line with the principle of consent, as set out in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.It is something I will never agree to — indeed it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal.That is why, following months of intensive work, we proposed a third option for future economic relationships, based on frictionless trade in goods.That is the best way to protect jobs and avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum and the integrity of the UK.Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter- proposal. So we are at an impasse.The second issue is linked to the first.We both agree the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that  there’s a delay in implementing our relationship, there still won’t be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.But the EU proposes to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union.As I’ve said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country.We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK.And it will be in line with the commitments we made in December — including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.We cannot accept anything that does not respect the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that isn’t in the interest of their citizens.Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it’s not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.So we now need to hear what the EU’s real issues are and what their alternative is.Until we do, we cannot make progress. In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for No Deal.In particular, I want to clary two issues. First, there are over three million EU citizens in the UK who’ll be worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future.Even in the event of No Deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay.Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of No Deal we’ll do everything to prevent a hard border.The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone.To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.For over two years I’ve worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU.I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I’ll not overturn the result of the referendum.Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They all believed him, that he really was genuinely trying to find solutions.“It was triggered during the debate that people thought no, we have to move on now.“Because  we don’t move on in October we’ll arrive in November with zero progress. Then we’re just organising a failure for November.”On Mrs May’s humiliating day, they added: “There was no ambush. There was a mismanagement of expectations on the UK side about what would happen.”Recent briefings by Number 10 about splits in the EU, plus warm overtones towards the UK from Poland and Hungary, hardened leaders’ resolve.The 27 leaders had arrived in Salzburg originally wanting to help Mrs May by choreographing a soft landing for a Brexit deal.An EU official added: “It’s true there was an expectation of de-dramatisation going into this summit and we saw that with Barnier offering a new version of a backstop beforehand.“That got offered to de-dramatise but that was undermined by the op-ed Theresa May published, and to an EU audience as well, where she completely dismissed the proposed Irish backstop and put things back into the sovereignty narrative.“We are concerned a little bit that the British game plan here is to push the backstop to the very end.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her post reads: “Unfortunately, due to many commitments and pressures, I am unable to attend to website orders.“Your support means a lot to us. Your kindness and generosity is no less appreciated, however, and continues to buoy us up.”Donations from well-wishers have now dwindled to nothing.A family friend said: “Public donations dried up a long time ago. Every time the story comes into the news a few kind people generously send a few quid in.“Last year’s tenth anniversary brought it into the public’s minds and most normal rational, kind human beings will donate then.“But the idea that money is still flooding in is just wrong. There are no public donations of any real value. In 2007 and 2008 the money was coming in but there was a gradual fade off after that.”Support for Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry was rocked when Portuguese police named them as “arguidos”, or suspects, in September 2007, and again when it emerged they had used public donations to pay two £2,000 instalments on their mortgage.The couple were also subjected to baseless yet frenzied social media allegations of involvement in their daughter’s death.The only extra money going into the fund now is from royalties on the book Kate wrote in 2011 about the case — Madeleine: Our Daughter’s Disappearance And The Continuing Search For Her.Together with serialisation deals, it is understood the book — which became a best-seller — has raised nearly £1million for the fund, which has six trustees including Kate and Gerry, both 50.Last year the book raised royalties amounting to £84,096.An insider said: “The fund always generates lots of animosity on social media and criticism. Some people think it is all public donations. It isn’t. In the early days more than a million pounds came in on a wave of sympathy in the shock of what had happened.“That money was largely spent in the first few years on private investigative work, as those donors would have wanted it to be. The original funds that have been given by public donation have long been spent, properly, but spent.”Tax expert Jim Lee, who has studied accounts filed by the fund since 2008, confirmed: “The accounts no longer say where their income is coming from. Most of it is from stock market investments and royalties from Kate’s book.“In the early days there were a lot on donations being made to their fund but they are certainly not getting the money from the public that once flowed in.”Most recent accounts revealed how just over £65,000 was spent on fees for the McCann’s Portuguese lawyer, Isabel Duarte, to cover the several years it took to lodge a case in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.The legal action is aimed at overturning a Portuguese Supreme Court ruling that detective Goncalo Amaral — who wrote a book about the case claiming Madeleine died in Portugal and her parents covered it up — did not defame the McCanns.If the couple lose the European Court of Human Rights case they face having to pay Amaral £430,000 in damages, plus costs, which could wipe out most of the remaining money.May 3, 2007: Madeleine vanishes from her bedroom while her parents eat nearby.September 6: Kate McCann attends a formal police interview.September 7: Kate and Gerry are made arguidos. Kate refuses to answer 48 questions.October 3: Detective Goncalo Amaral is removed from the case.April 7, 2008: Leicestershire Police interview McCann holiday pals dubbed “Tapas Seven”.July 21: Portugal authorities lt the arguido status from the McCanns.May 10, 2011: Scotland Yard launches Operation Grange dedicated to the case.April 25, 2012: Met release artist’s image of Madeleine aged nine.July 4: Scotland Yard says it is investigating 38 “persons of interest”, including 12 Britons.October 14: Met releases e-fits of men they want to trace, including man seen carrying a child.October 24: Portuguese police reopen their investigation.May 6, 2014: British detectives granted permission to excavate two sites near where Madeleine disappeared.October 28, 2015: Operation Grange team is cut from 29 to four.April 28, 2016: Met says investigators have one last line of inquiry.December 4: Scotland Yard gets extra funding to investigate “important” new lead.March 12, 2017: Scotland Yard gets £85,000 to extend investigation.September 30, 2018: £85,000 due to run outSo far, more than £11million of taxpayers’ money has been spent on the investigation. However, next Sunday the last £85,000 – which paid for three part-time detectives to keep the investigation going – will run out.It is believed Scotland Yard chiefs will ask the Home Office for £50,000 to £70,000 to continue the hunt.A source said: “It is not a huge amount. Scotland Yard have confirmed they are in dialogue with the Home Office yet again. Within a week or two the Yard will probably say ‘yes, we have agreed a small payment’ and it will roll on.“Being realistic, it will end sometime soon  there is no breakthrough.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Thursday they proved it, with their squalid ambush and the infantile taunting online.Mrs May has always treated EU leaders with respect. But these bullying egomaniacs, these swaggering posers in designer suits, lack the common decency to respect Britain, our Prime Minister and our democratic choice.So yesterday, on behalf of her position and the nation, she bit back. It was the best speech of her le. And her ­arguments were as unassailable as her welcome new tone was hostile.We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions — and make a mockery of the referendum verdict. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable. The fury at an EU which bullied us into a rerun would never subside. Nor would the rage at Remain diehards who ­colluded with Brussels to bring it about.The genie is out of the bottle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was so intelligent, Im convinced he would have done even better than I did.But the area in which we grew up made it hard to avoid the influence of gang activity. I love the area, but it has a way of sucking vulnerable people in — both black and white.David lived on a rough estate in North Woolwich with his nurse mum, who was born in the UK and of Nigerian descent, but never knew his father.He was just 12 when he was identied as a bright, but under-achieving student, and take under the wing of The Eastside Young Leaders Academy , founded by Ray Lewis.Lewis, an ex-prison service manager turned youth worker, formed a partnership with Rugby school to offer bursaries to support boys who might otherwise be sucked into a le of crime.David was considered a suitable candidate and after passing entrance exams and an interview with the schools bosses, he joined the sixth form in September 2009.It was a huge cultural adjustment for the then 16-year-old and the four other black East End pupils who had also gained a place at the school.Unlike their new classmates, the daunted schoolboys were dropped off by mini-bus and werent used to wearing unorms of smart jackets, house ties and black shoes.David recalled the feeling after arriving for the first time as being between complete awe and a sense of inferiority.He left Rugby with three A-levels in English, Business and Geography and went to Brighton University to study law and business before gaining a his masters.Throughout his time away from London, David remained friends with Stephen but over the years their paths increasingly erged.David said he was shocked and saddened when he found out through a friend that Stephen had been arrested on suspicion of murder.He added: That could have been me, easily. Im not saying that Rugby emancipated me from my greatest troubles, but it helped ensure a particular path wasnt taken.David now lives in East London with his civil servant we Deborah, 24, who he met through his church.He remains in touch with pal Stephen, visiting him in prison every few months and sending him books so he can continue his education.Stephen recently retook his maths GCSE and achieved a grade 7 - an A - and hopes to write a book, he says."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0003473368591-e1504162997128.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"princess diana would have been at prince harrys wedding if she had been wearing a seatbelt pathologist claims","story":"Dr Richard Shepherd maintains she would have walked away on the fateful night and been alive to see the her sons Harry and William get married.Princess Diana died on August 31, 1997, after suffering fatal injuries in a car crash in the Pont de lAlma road tunnel in Paris.Her companion Dodi Fayed and driver and security guard Henri Paul were also killed in the crash while her bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived with horric injuries.The car was travelling at up to 70mp - twice the speed limit -  and Paul was three times over the drink-drive limit.Dr Shepherd was a Home Office pathologist when he was called on to carry out the autopsy on Diana, one of the 23,000 or so he has performed in his career.“I wish I could say she would have died whatever happened, but the fact is,  she had worn her seatbelt she would have been here for Prince William and Harrys weddings,” he told the Daily Mail.Had she been strapped in “she would have walked away with a black eye or maybe a broken arm, but nothing more.“Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces.”Dr Shepherd was the pathologist who carried out post mortem examinations when 35 were killed in the Clapham rail disaster in 1988.He also examined the drowned bodies after the Marchioness tragedy in which a Thames pleasure boat sank with the loss of 51 lives in 1989.His experience also includes working on the terror attacks on 9/11, in Bali in 2002 and the London 7/7 bombings in 2005.He also carried out the post-mortems on young mother Rachel Nickell, murdered on Wimbledon Common in 1992, and Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager stabbed to death in a racial attack a year later.Dr Shepherd said he was inundated with questions about Diana but has refused to reveal intimate details.“People asked: Was she beautul? Was she peaceful? Was she pregnant?’”, he said.“I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadnt already appeared in the press.“Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know theyre pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?”At the inquest into Dianas death, accident investigator Anthony Read said he could almost guarantee the couple would have survived had they been strapped in and the car travelling with in the speed limit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435948972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds biggest oktoberfest kicks off lederhosen sink alcohol","story":"Dressed in traditional Lederhosen trousers and drindl blouses, many were seen sprinting to beat the queues at the 185th annual Oktoberfest event in Munich.More than seven million are expected to stumble in and out of the 34 massive, music-filled tents on the Theresienwiese field.The numbers are quite staggering: By the time last orders are called on October 2, almost seven million litres of beer will have been poured.This adds to 94,000 litres of wine, 42,000 litres of sparkling and another 299,000 litres of coffee and tea.These drinkers will have consumed more than 500,000 pieces of chicken and 280,000 pork sausages, according to the official website. The festival also expects to foil 111,000 cases of mug theft and there will be more than 1,000 tonnes of rubbish to clear up afterwards.In addition to the many huge beer tents selling regional beers, the Munich Oktoberfest sees traditional parades and live music - along with opportunities to taste lots of delicious local cuisine.Meanwhile, many more millions in cities around the world will attend celebrations modelled on the original Munich festival.But theres already scandal brewing: Many Germans are not fans of the revealing outfits being worn by beer-swilling female tourists who flock to Oktoberfest for a knees up.Cultural leaders believe much of what is being worn is becoming more and more like a porno version of the buxom dress called the dirndl.Franz Thalhammer, an accordionist and former chairman of Munich’s Georgenstoana Baierbrunn folk group, is not happy.According to the Times, he to a local newspaper how the costume bares no resemblance to the real thing.He added: A dirndl is something nice, it can make almost anyone pretty. But some of the dresses you see these days are crazy.A Munich based crime author also waded into the debate, saying: With the young women it often looks like porno dresses, short and low-cut and cheap material.The number of people sporting Baian folk costumes to the world’s biggest beer festival, which starts on September 22, has boomed in the past ten years.Ulku Stephanides, who has run the Carnival Store in Kensington, west London, told the Times: For women, we have either knee- or shorter than knee- dresses.

Britain could even stake a claim for the wreckage to be housed in the UK.The breakthrough came after a 25-year search for the exploration ship off the coast of Rhode Island, north-east US.Australian National Maritime Museum and Rimap will release 3D images of the wreck site.It is thought to be located just off Goat Island, a small island in the Narragansett Bay.Kathy Abbass, director of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, told Fairfax Media: We can say we think we know which one it is.It is exciting, we are closing in.

And the Labour leader will reluctantly back a second EU referendum  his party conference calls for it. In his only newspaper interview as delegates gathered in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said: “If this Government can’t deliver Brexit then it must move over and have a General Election.” To do this Mr Corbyn’s MPs and Tories from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s \u0026shyEuropean Research Group of \u0026shyBrexiteers would vote together against Mrs May’s Chequers plan. Labour set six tests for any final deal including a strong relationship with Europe, the same rights, protections and benefits we have now and fair migration to boost Britain’s economy.  Mr Corbyn said: “Chequers does not meet them. We are not happy with it and we would vote against it. “That could trigger a General \u0026shyElection and we’re ready for it.” Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on a final Brexit deal.  That was due next month but is likely now to slip into November. With 40 Tory MPs signalling they will vote against any deal based on Chequers that means the PM is left with nothing. Technically she has 21 days to find an alternative.  But Mrs May is clear it’s Chequers or no deal. And losing a Commons vote she has staked her premiership on could mean going back to the polls for the third time in three years. She won plaudits for Friday’s tough-talking No10 statement following EU leaders ambushing her at their Salzburg Brexit summit when they tried to torpedo Chequers. The PM demanded Europe shows Britain respect and gives ground. Mr Corbyn says that was ill-advised. He added: “Clearly negotiations didn’t go well in Salzburg but condemning everyone else in the room isn’t very helpful. “Of course everyone should show respect for each other, including the EU for Britain.  But we’re 26 months in from the referendum and we’re still at base camp. It’s extremely serious.”  Mrs May is still grappling with major issues like the customs union and the Irish border. But Mr Corbyn is also under pressure – to agree to a second referendum on either a final deal or whether to stay in the EU  there is no deal. He has been reluctant to commit himself. A poll by People’s Vote campaigners showed nearly 90 per cent of Labour Party members back another \u0026shyreferendum.  Three-quarters would like to see a commitment in Labour’s manesto. And 93 per cent would vote to stay in the EU  they were given a chance. Mr Corbyn remains unconvinced of the wisdom of a second vote, but he faces a conference motion this week which could force his hand.  He said: “What comes out of conference I will adhere to. But I’m not calling for a second referendum. I hope we will agree that the best way of resolving this is a General Election. “But I was elected to empower the members of the party. So  conference makes a decision I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly.” Mrs May said: “Advocating a second referendum and extending article 50 to delay Brexit is sending us right back to square one. “Many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step.”  Mr Corbyn has had a bruising summer beset by accusations of anti-semitism against both the party and him personally. And the row has not gone away with a survey published today by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which shows four in 10 British Jews would consider emigrating, up from 31 per cent last year.  Nine in 10 of those considering leaving say they believe Labour harbours anti-Semites – more than twice as many who said the same of UKIP. Mr Corbyn said of the allegations made against him personally: “I found it very hurtful.  I’ve spent my le campaigning against racism. “I campaigned against apartheid. So any allegation like that is personally hurtful.  “But I do recognise that the rise in anti-Semitism across Europe is awful, frightening and dangerous. We have to be resolute that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism or any other form of racism – and I won’t.” Before meeting Mr Corbyn I asked Abdul Abouker, 30, one of his bodyguards in Liverpool, what I should ask the Labour leader. He replied: “How does he deal with all the stress?” So I do... and Mr Corbyn tells me he runs, exercises, reads and tends his allotment. What to do  Chequers is chucked? Theresa May’s so-called Chequers plan got short shrt in Salzburg – but what are the alternatives which EU leaders insist we choose from?  There’s the Norway model which means membership of the European Economic Area and access to the EU’s single market. The downside is we would still contribute billions into the EU and have to accept freedom of movement. Our borders would not be our own. There’s the Swiss model which means membership of the European Free Trade Association but not of the EEA. It pays a smaller amount into Brussels than Norway but must accept free movement. And it does not have single market access for banking and services, which make up 80 per cent of the UK ecomony.

Local members will find it much easier to force a full open selection process against their MPs  the changes are passed by 1,600 delegates at this week\u0027s party conference. But the NEC stopped well short of backing a full system of mandatory reselection for every MP - which was demanded by many backers of Jeremy Corbyn . The compromise is part of a package of reforms agreed tonight after y debate by Labour\u0027s 41-member ruling NEC. The body also backed having a second deputy leader of the Labour Party , elected and on equal terms with Tom Watson, who will be guaranteed to be female. And it backed making it tougher - not easier - for an MP to get on the Labour leadership ballot, in a move that will infuriate the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. Currently sitting Labour MPs face a trigger ballot where each local branch, union branch and affiliated society branch in their constituency gets a single block vote per branch on whether to keep them before a general election. Only  they lose more than 50% of the total branch votes do they face a full-scale selection, pitted against rival candidates. Now the threshold will be reduced to 33%. And a reselection can be triggered by either a third of union affiliate branches, or a third of party branches.  Corbyn-backing group Momentum wanted to go further, and change to a full system of open selections - where every sitting MP faces a full reselection before each general election, even  they\u0027ve served for decades. More than 20,000 people signed a Momentum petition calling for such a system. Meanwhile a Momentum-backed bid to make it easier for MPs to stand for leader did not succeed. Currently any MP must get the backing of 10% of their fellow MPs before they can stand for leader. Corbyn backers wanted a package of measures that would lower this to 5% but also involve unions and local parties. Instead the threshold will stay at 10% of MPs - AND add 5% of local parties or 5% of union affiliate members. The latter must be across three trade unions or affiliates, at least two of which must be trade unions. It comes after a string of other measures were agreed at at NEC meeting on Tuesday. A Labour Party spokesperson said: Following the Democracy Review, the NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at Party Conference to remove barriers to political participation and help transform our Party into a mass movement for the many, not the few. “The Democracy Review is one of the biggest democratic exercises undertaken by any political party, with over 11,000 submissions and hundreds of consultation meetings held across the country.”  The leadership and reselection procedures now face being voted through within hours - it\u0027s taking place tomorrow - by 1,600 Labour delegates at the conference in Liverpool. It comes almost a year after Labour launched a \u0027democracy review\u0027 led by a close Corbyn aide with the aim of rebalancing power in the party away from the executive, and towards the members. Many proposals in the review - which does not cover all of tonight\u0027s developments - could not be agreed amid bitter in fighting. The Mirror understands Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who sits on the NEC, pushed for a full system of mandatory reselection - in a debate which is separate to the democracy review.  A Momentum source said: The result of tonight’s NEC shows the power of grassroots campaigning. Thousands of members lobbied their NEC representatives, Momentum petitions gathered 50,000 signatures and while the members haven’t got everything they wanted, these proposals are a signicant improvement on what was being discussed earlier in the week.  The changes in selections rules will give members far more say in who represents them and result in more open selections. And while the slight increase in the  threshold is deeply disappointing, we managed to avert disaster and avoid a dramatic increase to the leadership threshold which would have stopped a socialist candidate getting on the ballot in a future leadership contest.

Facing an unpaid rent bill the 27-year old, from Windsor, Berkshire, was prepared to try a new career. She had discovered a friend was working as a \u0027cam girl\u0027 and, encouraged by her sister, decided to give it go and hasn\u0027t looked back. She has now been a cam girl for several months and earns hundreds of pounds each day for a few hours\u0027 work talking online to men about their sexual fantasies and sometimes taking her clothes off or using sex toys.  She said: “I used to have low self-confidence and body insecurities but since taking up camming my self-esteem has rocketed. “What I used to see as imperfections are loved by my viewers. I believe that women should be entitled to do exactly as they please with their bodies without having to fear criticism. “My job is a bit like being a therapist and while sexual fantasies are a big part of camming I can spend hours simply discussing their day.”  Lola took time out to answer some of the Mirror\u0027s questions about her le as a camgirl.  What does a cam girl do? A cam girl will be online and visible to others through a webcam that also has a chat room to communicate via typing or audio. You will be able to chat in a group session with the cam girl, or you can go to a private room where it will be one-to-one. You will be charged per minute to chat - talking in private costs more. I charge \u0026pound2 a minute to chat to me in a group where men or women can see me fully-dressed  and I charge \u0026pound3 a minute to talk to me on a one-to-one basis. The cam girl is there for you to talk to... whether it be about your day at work, your plans at the weekend... or you could talk about your deepest fantasies and then it goes from there. A cam girl will also have a profile which will tell you all about them, you can gauge what experience you will have from this profile.  Is it just talk or is there a physical element? Do you stay fully clothed? In private I do take my clothes off, or I may be dressed in a requested outfit... PVC is the most popular and usually requested by someone who likes domination or humiliation. It\u0027s something I had to get used to as I\u0027m a super nice person. Being mean to someone because they enjoy it is a hard one to crack. I own several outfits and several toys that I use during private shows. A guy tends to spend an hour on average in private chat and we talk about all the things they would like to do. Public sex is the most common, getting up to no good in bars etc. I usually listen to them and then, to put it crudely, act out what they are telling me to do to myself. Are there any extreme behaviours you have witnessed? I have chatted to men who think it\u0027s okay to be extremely demanding, rude and, perhaps some would say, aggressive in the chat. I politely tell them that I will not tolerate it and I kick them out so they cannot  to the cam. They will often email through the website begging to be allowed back into the chat. I think they believe we NEED their business... there are plenty of respectable guys and girls looking to cam. Us cam girls can be very choosy and you have to be strong in this job, you do not have to do anything you feel uncomfortable with. You are your own boss. What is your average day? My average day will consist of me logging on for 9-10am. I will update my profile, keeping it relevant, and I will make sure it\u0027s visible on the front page of the website. I am a performer, it\u0027s my job to provide a sensual virtual experience to who I\u0027m talking to. I want the person to connect with me and feel as  they are in the room. I will spend the day logged on answering calls from ious people with ious desires. I usually clock off when I\u0027ve hit my goal  around 4pm when I resume my usual day. I like to keep my alter ego separate from real le. She\u0027s feisty, sexy and seductive whereas I\u0027m bubbly, laid back and enjoy slobbing on the sofa watching box sets.  How did you get into being a cam girl? I was first introduced to webcam when me and a friend stumbled across an older friend\u0027s social media which showed she was openly caming. I never dreamt that I would have the guts to start it myself. However after a work-related breakdown and being diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, which meant leaving my job, I thought: \u0027what\u0027s a girl to lose\u0027. I hadn\u0027t worked in seven months and my rent was due. I came across On The Record models on Instagram and within 24 hours my profile was live. What did you do before? I have worked in healthcare for 10 years and my last role was a Recruitment Co-Ordinator How much do you earn? On my first day I made \u0026pound1,700 and on a good day I can make \u0026pound700 in around 4 hours... I aim to make around \u0026pound150k in a year. Do you only work late at night? No, actually I have recently slipped into working 9-5. Perhaps it\u0027s embedded in me from my years of working in an office! If I make plans in the day, I will come home and work at night. However, early mornings are usually very busy. Most of the guys I speak to work from home, or are uni students or are on dferent time zones.. I\u0027ve been invited all over the world. I have a few regulars who cam with me from their office while they are \u0027working\u0027.  What do friends and family think of your job? My friends find what I do refreshing. They will ask me about my day at work with genuine interest. My family completely support me, it was in fact my sister who encouraged me to start camming as she thought I\u0027d be great at it. How does it affect your relationships? I am single at the moment. However, the last guy I was seeing did know about camming. He said that he was fine with it but we broke up shortly after I told him. I do believe he had an issue with it. We had a fun relationship before he knew. I would send him racy pictures and he would love it. After he found out, he would brush them off as  to say... it\u0027s not all for me. What has the money allowed you to do? The earning power is unlimited. I spent Christmas at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and am able to holiday when I like. I\u0027m going to Amsterdam next month and for some winter sun. I have now paid my rent up front for the next year as well as saving for a mortgage for my own place. I do enjoy trips to London to stock up on designer clothes too.  How do you keep yourself in shape and looking good? I\u0027m successful on cam thanks to my curves. I used to feel conscious that I wasn\u0027t a size 8. I\u0027ve been dieting all my le... now I make money from being a size 12-14 and men go weak for my curves. It\u0027s allowed me to accept myself but I eat well and I walk everywhere. What kinds of fans do you have and what kind of things do you get asked? I talk to so many dferent kinds of people. I speak to a famous Rugby player regularly, business men, extremely attractive young men and older women who are into domination. The most common thing I have been asked is  I will go on a date with the person I am talking to. I keep it strictly work. I\u0027ve had two men tell me they love me – interestingly both were married.  Do you have any “red lines” when it comes to private chat? Have you had to end calls or break off? There are standard red tape rules - no talk of under age sex, rape or animals. I have one guy say he enjoyed role play and asked me to be \u0027younger\u0027 but didn\u0027t state how young. I didn\u0027t get a good vibe from his so I cut the chat. Looking at it now I should have asked more. If he is in his 50s then being younger could be 20 plus. I\u0027ve had a chat in role play who was very aggressive to women and wanted to talk about the violent acts he would do to me. Again, I stopped the chat. Are you ever recognised? Do you have to be careful about personal details you give out? I\u0027ve been recognised once! A guy who worked behind a bar in a restaurant in Surrey was trying to work out where he knew me from. He went bright red and we both realised but did say anything else about it. What has it taught you about men? I believe that the men I speak to come to me because they either long for intimacy or they desire a more personal sexual experience than from, say, porn. I do speak to a lot of married men and I respect that they are not cheating on their wives. I do also speak to a lot of married men who are persistent in trying to meet me, a regular of mine has actually mentioned “love” and leaving his we, we speak around five hours and he\u0027s developed feelings. This does put me off being in a relationship. I think we all have desires that we need to meet, I\u0027m all for it as long as no one is hurt in the process.  Has it led to other opportunities? I\u0027ve been invited to very exclusive places through camming and I have been asked to model away from cam. There was a chap on cam who was 78 years old, he emailed me to ask  he could pay me \u0026pound3,000 a week  I would join him for dinner twice a week at his stately home. I did decline, I keep it strictly cam. Are you friends with other cam girls/boys?  I am indeed.  Off the Record  has an amazing group of women and men. We all chat in our WhatsApp group.  One of the girls and I are planning a cheeky week in the sun this October.

But the \u0027unprecedented\u0027 moment in May was far from the first time Meghan Markle had spoken passionately to an audience.  New video footage shows the Duchess of Sussex giving a touching speech at her middle school graduation, aged just 14. In the clip, she speaks movingly about social change, showing both her star potential and her keen awareness of social issues. She touches on ious things she and her classmates have learned at Immaculate Heart Middle School in Los Angeles in Calornia, US. Dressed in her graduation gown and cap, she describes how they have developed a sense of personal responsibility to our Earth.  She says they have observed their fragile environment, as well as experiencing a deep compassion to those suffering from AIDS. And she looks ahead to her and her schoolmates\u0027 potential futures in politics, finance, entertainment, education and many other fields. At the start of the footage, Meghan can be seen waiting in line behind other graduates in the school\u0027s church, beaming as she looks around. As her name is read out, she then walks forward and collects her diploma to loud cheers, before hugging a smiling member of staff. Later in the footage, she walks to the front again to deliver her speech to the audience at Immaculate Heart, a private Catholic school for girls. Speaking confidently to attendees, the then-future royal says: Good evening parents, friends, faculty and fellow classmates of Class 1995.  Today we are here to celebrate our graduation, and to share our appreciation for our brief time at Immaculate Heart Middle School. Two years ago, we came here as young girls - a bit frightened and overwhelmed and filled with wonder and anticipation about our new school and what our future would bring. Today, we are proud and more confident young women on our way to high school. She adds: We have so much to be thankful for. First, the privilege of attending Immaculate Heart Middle School. Second, our parents for the sacrice and commitment to our excellent education. Third, the faculty and staff and their patience, dedication and support over these last two years. And most of all, we thank the two women with great heart who had a vision and founded our school.  And today, we acknowledge the women of the community and other people who keep Immaculate Heart going and growing. In her speech, Meghan, now 37 and living at Kensington Palace, also says this great nation will always be in our hearts and prayers. We have grown in many ways over these last two years - physically, academically, emotionally and spiritually, she tells the audience. The academics were a challenge, but we learned to meet the challenge and steadily we prepared. In science class, we observed our fragile environment, and developed a sense of personal responsibility to our Earth. We also learned about and experienced a deep compassion to those who suffer with the AIDS virus. She then mentions the values she learned during religion classes, which have helped her and others to develop spirituality in our lives.  She continues: And who can ever forget the numerous pop quizzes in English which seemed horrendous but taught us to be organised and properly prepared for class. The audience also hears about how students would paint images of nature in art class and keep their hearts pumping with PE. Meghan says: We also learned to be organised and responsible iniduals with an awareness of our moral responsibilities to our school and our community, which we demonstrated when we adopted the first and second graders from Immaculate Conception and Inner City School. She tells her classmates that the times they shared at Immaculate Heart - both painful and happy - will always be deeply valued. Now, as we enter high school, we go with the values instilled at Immaculate Heart Middle School, she adds.  At one point, Meghan accidentally mixes up her words. She looks up and says excuse me, before smoothly carrying on. We will graduate from high school in 1999 and begin college in the next century taking many dferent paths, she says. Some of us will go into politics, finance, entertainment, education and many other fields. But no matter what field we choose, we will always carry the spirit of Immaculate Heart with us. And always and forever as women of great heart, dedicate ourselves to making it a better world.  As her speech comes to an end, Meghan receives a huge round of applause.  The Duchess, who graduated from the middle school in the summer of 1995, grew up in Los Angeles where her mum Doria Ragland still lives.  She became a member of the Royal Family when she tied the knot with Prince Harry at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, on May 19. Her father, Thomas Markle Snr, was forced to miss the big day due to health issues, so Meghan gave a speech of her own in his absence. Earlier this week, she gave another speech as she launched a charity cookbook in aid of those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy.

Sending the mum to prison, a judge told her she had put her need for drugs ahead of the welfare of her son. Swansea Crown Court heard police were called to the woman\u0027s house by concerned neighbours. Tom Scapens, prosecuting, said neighbours reported seeing a toddler hanging out of the window of a nearby property. The court heard that for some 30 minutes the youngster was seen playing at the open window, climbing through it, and standing on the outside window sill before clambering down from the window and playing in the garden, Wales Online reports.  The boy, who was aged just two, later climbed back into the living room using a garden chair that was under the window. Mr Scapens said police arrived at the house in Swansea and through the window saw the boy\u0027s mum unconscious or asleep on the sofa in the living room. They tried to rouse her but to no avail. Eventually it was her son who brought his mother around by repeatedly hitting her in the face and shouting her name. When she opened the door to the police the mother – who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child – said to the officers: Hiya. All right? How are you? The prosecutor said police quickly formed the opinion she was under the influence of drink or drugs. Inside the house the officers found a syringe of heroin which had been prepared ready for administering, a piece of foil containing heroin residue, and cannabis in a grinder. As the woman was being handcuffed police found she had six Valium tablets in her hand. The court heard that one of the officers stepped outside to call social services and when he ed to the house the boy approached him, called him Daddy, and asked to be picked up.  Mr Scapens said the youngster was confused about the adults in the property. The woman, who is aged in her 20s, pleaded guilty to child neglect, and to possession of heroin, cannabis, and Valium. The court heard the woman had a long-standing drug problem and a history of offences committed to fund that habit. However she has refused to work with drug and other agencies to address the problem. Her son is now living with a family member and is said to be flourishing in his new environment. Andrew Evans, for the defendant, said his client had a dficult upbringing and had lacked positive role models in her le. He said the boy was now living with a responsible and appropriate person and his client accepted that description could not be applied to her at the moment. He added that the woman had reached rock bottom. Judge Peter Heywood said the toddler could easily have fallen from the window and suffered serious injury – or even made his way from the un-gated garden onto the road and been hit by passing traffic. Addressing the defendant he said: You were intoxicated through having taken controlled drugs. Your drug addiction was your prime concern, not the care of your child which should have been the most precious thing in your le.

Officers in Cambridgeshire have had to take people to A\u0026ampE because of the chronic shortage of paramedic crews, the county’s Police and Crime Commissioner has confirmed. East of England Ambulance Service Trust is cracking under huge strain on its resources, accusations of bad management and shocking waiting times. It has already revealed a controversial plan for patients to share ambulances and in many cases relatives frustrated by long delays have resorted to taking patients in their own vehicles. Now police are also stepping in to fill the gap by ferrying patients in patrol cars rather than make them wait for hours.  Commissioner Jason Ablewhite said: “Having been out with officers and seen examples, I worry that officers are placing themselves at risk by transporting people to A\u0026ampE in the back of police cars. “Sometimes this would seem the most sensible approach,  given advice that an ambulance will take three to four hours. However, the responsibility for this lies with the ambulance service.” "},{"url":null,"title":"forensic pathologist who examined princess","story":"NewsPrincess Diana: Forensic pathologist who examined princess\u0027s body reveals bizarre questions people asked himDr Richard Shepherd re-examined the princess\u0027s body for the official inquiry into her death in a Paris car crash two decades agoShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans09:49, 22 SEP 2018Updated16:16, 22 SEP 2018NewsDr Richard Shepherd, who featured on Autopsy on Netflix, has examined thousands of dead bodies\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs one of the world\u0027s most renowned forensic pathologists, Dr Richard Shepherd has examined more than 23,000 dead bodies. And one of these was Princess Diana\u0027s. Dr Shepherd, now 65, re-examined the princess\u0027s body for the official inquiry into her death in a Paris car crash two decades ago. Diana, 36, and her lover Dodi Fayed, 42, were killed when their Mercedes crashed in an underpass in the French capital in August 1997. And after conducting a second autopsy on the late princess\u0027s body, Dr Shepherd was asked some bizarre questions about her appearance.  Other people questioned whether she had been pregnant. People asked: \u0027Was she beautul?\u0027 \u0027Was she peaceful?\u0027 \u0027Was she pregnant?\u0027, the dad, whose new memoir has just been published, told the Daily Mail. I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadn\u0027t already appeared in the Press. He continued: Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?  The pathologist also claimed that Diana would have been here for Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Markle in May  she had worn her seatbelt. If she had taken this step, he believes she would have survived the tragedy in the Pont de l\u0027Alma road tunnel with a black eye or maybe a broken arm. Driver Henri Paul, said to have been twice the British drink-drive limit, also died in the horric smash. The only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees. A string of official enquiries later ruled Diana and Dodi died in an accident when their French driver crashed their car while drunk in the tunnel. The jury at the princess\u0027s inquest found the pair had been unlawfully killed and their deaths were the result of “gross negligence” on the part of Henri and paparazzi who were following the vehicle on motorbikes.

The labrador’s reactions as she detects cocaine are unmistakable and her efforts have helped put Border Force teams on course for a record haul. In 2016-17 they nabbed more than 4,500 kilos of the Class A drug with a street value of \u0026pound450million. That was up 28 per cent on 2015-16. But a string of major busts has already seen 4,000 kilos seized since April. The figures emerged as the Sunday Mirror went behind the scenes at Gatwick Airport, where cute and sweet-natured Honey strikes terror into the hearts of drug smugglers.  A whf of a Class A substance and she is on it in a flash. She also mingles with passengers at luggage carousels to unsettle what Border Force Assistant Director Chris Capel calls the “wrong ’uns”. Officers monitor the reaction of passengers and pounce on those who look suspicious when they try to clear customs. It could be tell-tale perspiration on an upper lip or something as innocent as scuffed shoes which look out of place with an immaculate suit.  Chris says: “Roving officers are looking for behaviour indicators to see who needs further examination. If Honey makes someone nervous or uncomfortable, we take a proper look.” Biggest seizure of the year so far was two tonnes of cocaine found when a yacht was intercepted off the Cornish coast in July by Border Force cutter HMC Vigilant. Two men stand trial next year.  That month Border Force officers at Gatwick also found 15 kilos of cocaine worth \u0026pound1.5million hidden in two cases – and 1.5 kilos on another passenger. A further 8.5 kilos came in on a flight from Barbados this month – hidden in boxes marked “Rum”. Honey’s job is to snf out cocaine, crack, heroin and tobacco. Even four cartons of smuggled cigs will lose the Treasury \u0026pound200 in revenue.  Handler Liz Martinez, 33, says: “When Honey gets it right she gets a treat. When she gets it wrong she gets told off.” Smugglers who swallow cocaine – “stuffers” as Border Force call them – can be detected by X-ray but offer a dferent challenge. They can hide \u0026pound100,000-worth of drugs in 60 plastic pellets which won’t burst. And it takes a time-consuming three bowel movements before the “cargo” is offloaded. The really big finds come in ingenious hiding places in cargo shipments. Border Force was created in 2012 by then Home Secretary Theresa May to combine the roles of customs, immigration and passport control.  But it is not just drugs that come under the Border Force’s gaze in the cargo examination area – where tax avoiders and dodgy dealers are rumbled. Senior officer Rob Chapman, 39, slices open one of 12 boxes from the Far East and listed as “multi-media players and screen parts” worth \u0026pound3,500. But he finds six \u0026pound500 iPhones in each box – so \u0026pound36,000-worth in all. They will be auctioned and the proceeds go to Chancellor Philip Hammond. A pile of boxes of “photography accessories” actually holds \u0026pound800 Canon cameras. A haul of 5,200 fake football shirts might have earned counterfeiters \u0026pound50 a go.

Lumox Lewis\u0027, le was completely shattered when his dad died three years ago, which led to him attempting to take his own le .  On April 14 this year he cuddled his two children, Brandan and Alfie, goodbye, told his we Sammy he was going for a walk, and then jumped off the clfs near his home in Perranporth in Cornwall.  Lumox, 34, who works as a panel beater and sprayer told Cornwall Live : I remember it as clear as day.  I was sat on the sofa and I just felt worthless. I put on a happy front but I felt so lonely inside. Empty. From the outside I had everything - a beautul we, two beautul children, cars, a job. But inside I had nothing. It didn\u0027t matter how hard I worked, I felt like there was nothing worth staying around for. I said to my we, \u0027I\u0027m going for a walk darling\u0027 and that was it - I jumped off a clf.  But he survived. The keen surfer and ex-rugby player woke up in hospital with only bruises. Incredibly his instincts kicked in when he hit the water. In a complete blur, he managed to swim to safety, staying clear of the rocks and out of trouble. But this wasn\u0027t it for him. He was going to try again. After being sectioned for three days in hospital, Lumox was discharged and the first thing he did was attempt to finish what he hadn\u0027t achieved the first time round. It wouldn\u0027t happpen though. When he got off the bus from the hospital, a friend, who Lumox knew, but not very well, happened to be passing. And it was that chance conversation that changed everything. Recalling how these events unfolded, Lumox said: I remember sitting in my hospital bed and thinking, \u0027I can\u0027t even get that right, I can\u0027t even kill mysellf\u0027. I planned to do it all again, but then I bumped into Dale [Smith], who had no clue what was going on, or what I was planning to do. He asked  I was alright, and said he was going to the gym. He said it was time I got back to the gym too. We just stood there talking. Now I can\u0027t thank him enough. After that chance conversation, Lumox signed up to the Kernow\u0027s Strongest Man competition. He began a vigorous training regime and completely changed his diet.  He had a focus. He began opening up about his mental health. Now his le has direction. A meaning. If I didn\u0027t train my mind would wander elsewhere, he said. I still get days where I wake up and wonder why I am here. But I turn those negative thoughts into positivity, and it\u0027s a lot easier to do that now. Lumox has gone from being 17-and-a-half stone to weighing 22 st 5 lbs. He\u0027s gone from eating 2,500 calories a day to eating 5,5000. He also trains up to, and sometimes more than, six hours a day in the gym. He has completed three strongest man competitions and got second place in a national competition. Now he wants to go pro. I want to be the strongest man in the UK, he said. He added: From that day to now, my le has made a total U-turn. I\u0027m not completely out of the woods, but I have my trophies to look at and a sign above my door with a quote from Winston Churchill saying, \u0027If you\u0027re going through hell, keep going\u0027. I look at that door, and I keep going. But the biggest factor for me was opening up and talking about it. It\u0027s OK not to be OK.

Frank Springett, 91, could be split from his beloved we Mary, 86, in a move which would “devastate” the couple, their family say. Their case offers a snapshot into the crisis facing adult care in the UK which faces a \u0026pound2 billion black hole due to Tory cuts. Both Frank and Mary suffer serious health problems, but their family say they are still happily living together in a care home which caters for their every need. The couple even renewed their wedding vows in May — on the day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding — with a cake, photographer and vicar performing the ceremony. Mary suffers from severe Alzheimer’s, while Frank has artritis, the muscle stfness condition polymyalgia rheumatica and is almost totally deaf. The family is keeping the funding row secret from Frank and they fear the stress of being separated from his we could kill him. The couple sold their \u0026pound156,000 home in Henley in Arden earlier this year to help fund their \u0026pound8,000-a-month care bills.  But now their cash is running low and in a few months time they face the prospect of being separated from each other for the first time in seven decades. Daughter Joanne Downes, 57, said social services told them her parents would be split up and moved to dferent homes. She said: “It would devastate my mother  my father was not with her, and vice versa. “They are a couple who have been together 70 years, married for 67 years and never, ever spent time apart. “I cannot and will not accept that they cannot be together.” Barbara Keeley, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Minister for Social Care, said: “This is the shocking extent of the Tory Government’s social care crisis: a devoted older couple threatened with separation because of the funding black hole facing councils. “More and more older people face the uncertainty of how to pay for care because of the Tories’ shameful cuts to council budgets and their failure to fix a care crisis they have created. “Labour in Government will finally end the Tory social care crisis: we will start to bring stability to the social care system by immediately investing an additional \u0026pound8 billion and place a letime cap on care costs so no one faces losing everything as they do now. Experts say Britain’s beleaguered care system is underfunded by \u0026pound2 billion with growing numbers of pensioners have been forced to pay soaring care home bills.  A soaring number of care home closures – more than 12 each month last year – has added to the problem. Recent research by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services found care for vulnerable adults are on the verge of collapse in some areas of England, despite the provision of extra government funding. They said: “The overall picture is of a sector struggling to meet need and maintain quality in the context of rising costs, increasingly complex care needs, a fragile provider market and pressures from an NHS which itself is in critical need of more funding.” The report revealed English councils plan to push through social care cuts of \u0026pound700m in 2018-19, equivalent to nearly 5% of the total \u0026pound14.5bn budget. Since 2010, social care spending in England has shrunk by \u0026pound7bn. The government say they have provided an extra \u0026pound9.4bn over three years to help deal with the pressure. Frank and Mary’s family claim the loving couple face being split because of a row with Solihull Council, in the West Midlands, over the provision of care. Mary suffers from severe Alzheimer’s which has been getting progressively worse. She had been wandering out of their old home and needed to be helped back home by neighbours and on one occasion the postman. She is also incapable of holding a conversation.  Frank also has his health problems and needs a walking frame to get around. His hands are swollen due to arthritis, he needs help with the toilet and is almost totally deaf. They lived independently in their own home until March this year when their family took the decision to move them into a care home due to their failing health. The couple are currently still together in the Cedar Lodge Care Home, close to their family. But they face being split as the council has offered to pay costs towards Mary’s care - but they say retired factory worker Frank is able to look after himself. Their children, Roderick and Joanne, are battling to keep them together. A third child, Gerald, tragically died of a brain tumour in 2005. The family has made three appeals to social services which have all concluded they should be separated. They are now taking their case to the ombudsman. Joanne said because her parents owned their own home they were not eligible for any help paying care home fees. They sold the house for \u0026pound156,000 and the proceeds are currently paying \u0026pound975-per-week for Mary’s care and \u0026pound925-per-week for Frank. Planning ahead the family contacted Solihull social services to ask about their future options when the money runs out. She said: “To date we’ve had no funding from social services at all, which we understand because we have money to pay.  “They’ve said they’ll pay \u0026pound500 per week towards my mom’s care - but that the family will need to pay a top-up fee of \u0026pound475 a week. “But they won’t pay anything for my dad’s fees because they say he can look after himself. They say he can live in a flat in the community with carers coming into him.” She added: “The money is running out. I have constantly been in touch with Solihull council but they never answered my emails or phone calls. The council failed to provide the care promised leaving us no choice. “We have now been through three stressful appeals and they maintain they should be split.” Joanne said both her mum and dad needed the round-the-clock care Cedar Lodge provided. She said: “Initially when Mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014 Dad was quite mobile and Mom was still ing quite well, so they ticked along as a team.” This was when social services first became involved with the couple as Mary was also suffering from Nodular Porigo - a nasty type of eczema - and needed to undergo sunlight treatment at the hospital. Joanne said: “As time passed mom’s Alzheimer’s was getting worse and she was becoming more and more forgetful. My father was insistent at this time that he could cope. “He is a very proud man and did not want anybody doing anything for him. This was a really hard time for us as a family because they clearly needed help.” She said they started to realise Frank was struggling to cope: “He is not a moaner and that is part of the problem, he will never admit he is in pain. “His deafness made communication really dficult when he was having problems with Mom, because he couldn’t ring me to tell me, as he couldn’t hear me. “We got to a point last year when mom was escaping out of the house and the neighbours were bringing her back. “When my Mom’s condition deteriorated she would be extremely emotional, she would lie on the floor and refuse to get up. “My dad would get very upset about this and he would call me at work and I would have to come over in my lunch hour to try and calm things down. “I knew that this could not carry on.” In October last year they requested a further assessment from Social Service to get some more help. She said: “At this point my dad was still adamant that he could care for my mom, although it was becoming obvious he couldn’t.” Over Christmas Frank finally recognised he was struggling: “By Christmas I was exhausted and so was Dad. Dad’s mobility was extremely bad, he also had bad psoriasis, I think due to stress, and he was becoming prone to water infections.  “My mom was oblivious to the situation, obviously due to the illness. Over Christmas my brother and I spoke with our father and he finally agreed that he was not coping at all. He understood that he could not look after mom or himself at home any more. “This was a big admission by Dad, he had always remained insistent that he was fine and he could cope, so I know it took a lot for him to admit that he couldn’t.” But she claimed they then struggled to get the help they needed from social services. “Social services told us we then had to make a fresh application for Dad as only mom was under their care. “I didn’t realise this, I thought they were both in the system to be looked after. Anyway, they came out and assessed dad and mom again.” The couple were given a care package - but Joanne said they had repeated problems when the carers failed to arrive at their home. “I voiced my concerns about the failure to turn up by the carers which was happening regularly. I was told they would get something sorted. However, it was no better. We had days when no one showed up.” Frustrated by the lack of support the family took the decision to put Frank and Mary in the care home, using their own cash to pay. “After long discussions we all agreed that their house would be sold and we would use the money to self-fund them both in a care home. “We found Cedar Lodge, a lovely home. We decided we would move them in to the home as the situation at home was untenable, mom had got out of the house on a number of occasions and dad had had a fall on the drive trying to get her back in. “We both knew that this could not carry on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle reveals secret memento","story":"NewsMeghan Markle reveals secret memento from first date with Prince Harry was hidden inside her wedding dressThe Duchess of Sussex shows her \u0027something blue\u0027 along with other dress secrets in new TV documentaryShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJanine Yaqoob20:37, 22 SEP 2018Updated22:03, 22 SEP 2018NewsMeghan reveals the secrets of her wedding dress\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle has revealed how a memento from her first date with Prince Harry was hidden in the veil of her wedding dress.

She says: “For me, including some sort of representation of all 53 of the Commonwealth countries was key and I’d originally said to Clare Waight Keller, the designer, how can we incorporate that? “Would it be the state flower, country flower of each place? And it was her idea to do wild flowers, which I think ended up being a really beautul way to embody the feeling of it.”  Meghan said she kept the touching tribute to his family a secret from Harry until the big day in May. “It was important for me, especially now being a part of the Royal Family, to have all 53 of the Commonwealth countries incorporated,” she says. “I knew that it would be a fun surprise as well for my now husband, who didn’t know, and he was really over the moon to find out that I would make this choice for our day. “And I think the other members of the family had a similar reaction.” "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed englands hardest schools place","story":"NewsRevealed: England\u0027s hardest schools to get a place in - the chances of getting YOUR child into their favouriteA handy tool reveals how oversubscribed schools are in your area, as official figures reveal huge iationsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Burke12:53, 22 SEP 2018NewsGetting a place at your first choice school can be dficult in some parts of the country \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA handy tool can help parents find out how likely their kids are to get a place in their preferred school - as official figures reveal an astonishing iation across the country.

Chiefs at the City of London Academy Highgate Hill in Islington, north London, have ordered that children stay silent as they walk to and from their classrooms. The school, which has around 500 pupils, was previously called the Mount Carmel Catholic College for Girls, but was taken over in September last year and turned into a mixed academy for kids aged 11-18. The headmaster, Prince Gunnuh, said that any pupils caught chatting in-between lessons - or walking on the \u0027wrong\u0027 side of the corridors - now face detention. In a letter to parents - and published on the school\u0027s website under the title \u0027Behaviour in the Corridor\u0027 - the headteacher said there would be \u0027sanctions\u0027 for any pupil caught talking since the policy came into force on September 5.  Pupils were also warned to \u0027walk on the left\u0027 of the corridors - or again face \u0027sanctions\u0027. The headteacher stated in his letter: There has been a further improvement since I last wrote to you about our expectation regarding the atmosphere in our corridors. However, there is still a noticeable level of noise during lesson changeover times, this has been very disruptive to ongoing lessons. We are aiming for a scholastic atmosphere in the corridors at all times. Hence from September students will be given a warning when they leave their lessons and will be expected to walk in silence, and on the left to their next lessons or break. There will be a sanction for students who break this clear expectation. The new rules - which will see pupils given a \u0027first warning\u0027  caught chatting before being put in detention  they are caught a second time - have been blasted as taking the school \u0027back to Victorian times\u0027.  Pupils also face having their mobile phone confiscated for an entire term  they are spotted fiddling with them in school - and they are confiscated for two weeks  they are heard ringing in their bags or pockets. Ken Muller, a spokesman for the local National Education Union, told the Camden New Journal newspaper last week: Of course schools should require students to move around in an orderly way. But schools should also be joyful places and adopting \u0027silent systems\u0027 in corridors - with children banned from speaking to one another like those that were adopted in Victorian prisons - is unlikely to help make them so. Tamkin Anwari, whose daughter has just started in Year 7 at the school, said: They are children, they are not adults, and we cannot expect them to stay quiet all day. When they are with friends, I am sure they will talk.

In a dramatic end to one of the City\u0027s most complex and convoluted takeover sagas in recent memory, Comcast won out in a day-long auction overseen by Britain\u0027s Takeover Panel today. Comcast\u0027s bid was \u0026pound17.28 per share, beating 21st Century Fox\u0027s \u0026pound15.67 per share, after the auction went to the maximum three rounds. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: This is a great day for Comcast. Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team. This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. We couldn\u0027t be more excited by the opportunities in front of us. We now encourage Sky shareholders to accept our offer, which we look forward to completing before the end of October 2018.  Sky\u0027s independent directors have recommend Comcast\u0027s bid to shareholders, urging them to accept the offer immediately. It effectively means Rupert Murdoch has failed for a second time to gain full control of the pay-TV giant. US firm Comcast had originally tabled a \u0026pound26 billion, \u0026pound14.75 a share bid for Sky, while Fox\u0027s offer for the 61% of the UK broadcaster it does not already own valued it at \u0026pound24.5 billion at \u0026pound14 a share. But Comcast\u0027s final winning bid on Saturday - which gives Sky an enterprise value of over \u0026pound30 billion - dwarfed Fox\u0027s. Fox and Comcast were only allowed to make fixed-price cash bids in sterling. Comcast owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US. With the Sky takeover, Comcast will become the biggest pay TV provider in the world, with around 52 million customers after adding Sky\u0027s 23 million subscribers. Winning Sky will also aid Comcast in its fight against the rise of Netflix and Amazon. Ben Barringer, equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: We can see why Comcast is attracted to Sky. The predominantly US business is in decline - Sky offers it the opportunity to ersy outside of America. The acquisition means that it can expand its customer base in the UK, Italy and Germany. Furthermore, Comcast\u0027s current viewership is in decline. Consumers are no longer buying whole cable packages but are rather going for \u0027skinny bundles\u0027 with SVODs  such as Netflix, which offer content at a lower price point acquiring Sky means that Comcast can also ersy its route to market.

The wind and rain are likely to cause chaos on roads and rail networks, and homes and businesses will be at risk of flooding. The warning is in place between 6am and midnight on Sunday, during which time up to 50mm of rain could fall in some areas. A Met Office statement said: During Sunday there is the potential for a developing weather system to track across southern UK, which is likely to bring a swathe of persistent and at times heavy rain, as well the potential for strong winds.  Whilst there remains some uncertainty in the precise track and intensity of the system, and thus the location of the heaviest, most persistent rainfall, many places could see 20-30mm, with up to 50mm possible in some isolated spots. With strong winds also forecast in places, and recent heavy rain, drains and culverts blocked by debris could mean impacts in places which would not normally be affected by these rainfall amounts. And it added: There is a small chance of injuries and danger to le from flying debris. Today is expected to be damp in the south, with heavier rain into Wales and southwest England, and rural frosts possible around the UK.  Temperatures are expected to be between 11C and 14C around the country, with similar figures likely tomorrow.

According to the long-range weather forecast, El Nino - a band of warm ocean air - could bring a change in air behaviour leading to icy temperatures over to the UK. Combined with a drop in solar activity, this winter could be one of the coldest in recent years with freezing winds, buckets of snow and minus temperatures all a possibility throughout the season. However, long-range forecasts only give an indication of what may happen and the Met Office, for instance, does not offer forecasts longer than 30 days.  Instead, these models give one idea of what the weather could look like months down the line. One weather forecaster says an intense cold snap could last all the way to February next year, making it similar to the big freeze of 2010, which saw the coldest December since records began in 1910. James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express the chilly weather could start to take effect from the second half of October. Although, happily it may mean a white Christmas.

During the disturbing clip, the workman can be seen taking the underwear out of the dirty laundry basket and putting them to his face. He then pockets the underwear, from a room used by a three year-old girl and her five year-old sister.  The family reported the incident to police in Playa Vista, Calornia and called the worker, who was supposed to be repairing damaged floors, to tell them he had been caught. The man should have been carrying out repairs on the bedroom floor. The footage was captured by a Nest camera perched on one of their cribs.  Mr Cooper was furious after he saw the footage. He told KTLA5: “I would have never imagined that somebody would do this.  The dad said a moving company they hired had left their floors scratched, so the firm paid for a contractor to fix the issue. Jason told the news channel: “My we thought he might have been a little bit creepy, but I didn\u0027t catch any red flags. He added: “The next clip I saw was him picking up a pair of underwear, one of my daughters\u0027 dirty underwear, turning around from the camera, but you can see him bringing it to his face.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how one man broken up","story":"NewsHow one man has broken up 4,000 relationships and caused 17 orces - in just 10 daysAnd the number is still rising...Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience12:20, 21 SEP 2018Updated16:10, 21 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/tv/video/daniel-sloss-explains-show-broken-13285865,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSitting down to watch Netflix on a Saturday night is something many people do with their other half. If so, you might want to steer clear of Daniel Sloss\u0027 show - as it might lead to bit of an awkward moment or, worse still, the demise of your relationship. The Scottish comedian says a 20-minute joke in one of his shows has been responsible for more than 4,000 break-ups. His live stand-up routines have been streaming on Netflix since September 11 - yes, it only became available to view 10 days ago. In his show Jigsaw, the 28-year-old, from Fe, rubbishes the notion that everyone has a soulmate, saying the message society puts out is: If you are not with someone, you are broken. If you are not with someone, you are incomplete. If you are not with someone, you are not whole.  As a result, we are made to feel as though we need a partner to feel complete - meaning many settle and end up with the wrong person. “We’ll force this f***ing person into our lives because we’d much rather have something than nothing, he explains. The advice has struck a chord with people all over the world, who have been messaging Sloss to thank him for changing their lives.  One wrote: Hi Daniel! I am 23 years old  and I wanted to say you can add a orce from a 3 year emotional abusive marriage to your list. I just finished watching your show, and I was having doubts about whether or not I had made the right decision. However, the questions and situations you brought up confirmed that it\u0027s ok to say that I deserve better.  Another said: Guess you can add another to your list. Watched jigsaw and just wanted to say thank you. Certainly not the message I expected from a comedy special but the analogy has been stuck in my head ever since and you were right. People have even turned him into a meme.  Last week Daniel told the Daily Record : “The joke is 20 minutes long and was never intended to break couples up. It’s just a joyous effect of it. “It’s a love letter to single people, pointing out that most of the time being single is better than being in a relationship. “Turns out it resonates with people so much they’re dumping their s*** partners. “Before Netflix, the tally was 500. It’s now more than 2500 – and those are only the confirmed numbers, people who have messaged me. “I wouldn’t be shocked  it was four times higher.” "},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens falkirk v dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSecond-half headers from Pavol Safranko and Craig Curran see the points heading back to DundeeDundee United laboured for much of the first-half but opened the scoring in the second 45 through Safranko\u0026#8217s header from a Fraser Aird delivery on 65 minutes.Curran made it two on 86 minutes as he flicked a lovely looped header over the Bairns\u0026#8217 goalkeeper Leo Fasan.The win sees the Terrors move up to third in the Championship \u0026#8211 just two behind leaders Ayr United.Full match details in the live blog below.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba4c1f2472b0.jpg ","title":"braeview academy pupils cheered up by visit from dundee united footballers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils from Braeview Academy were visited by Dundee United football players. 100vw, 3000px\" /The S1 pupils have been spending time at the Fairfield Community Sports Hub after their school was partially damaged in a fire.John Cairney, projects officer from the sports centre, said: “We have been trying to keep the days as fun-filled as possible.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann has three games to save his job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPatience is wearing thin with the Dundee hierarchy and manager Neil McCann has just three matches to save his job.The Tele understands the Dark Blues boss has until the next international break to turn his side’s fortunes around.However, a heavy loss to Hibs today followed by defeat to Hamilton next week could accelerate that process.The Tele also believes there is appetite for change at Dens and owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms have been urged to sound out potential successors to McCann.However, the key decision-makers at the club are prepared to give the current gaffer more time to get the results that could kickstart the Dark Blues’ season.That patience will only last so long, though.Next week’s trip to Hamilton is followed by a home game against Steve Clarke’s Kilmarnock before the Premiership takes another break with international football taking over.By then, results are a must  Neil is continue in his role as manager.Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer will be hoping for a midfield boost today against Hibs.Glen Kamara has missed almost the entire season, starting just the opening Betfred Cup group stage win over Stirling Albion and the 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone three weeks ago.The Finnish international injured his ankle after that victory in Stirling and has struggled on with it since.He suffered a recurrence a fortnight ago as he prepared to travel to join up with his national side and then missed last week’s trip to Ibrox.He has, though, ed to training this week and is hoping to be fit enough to play a part against the Hibees at Dens today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba4c39847e8e.jpg ","title":"dundee council urged to speed up land sales after just 62 affordable homes built in a year","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil bosses have been urged to speed up the sale of land for new homes to be built on across Dundee – after falling behind on their housebuilding targets.Just 62 affordable homes – offering low rent to people on modest incomes – were built in 2017-18, short of the 200 the council had planned. The authority has a strategy to build 1,000 by 2021.Numerous families across the city are desperate to move to more suitable properties but feel stuck in their current homes due to a lack of supply.Barry Lamont, a full-time parent to D-Jay, 9, and Rudi, 5, is keen to get out of his Hilltown home, which he shares with partner, Gemma, 25, who is also a full-time parent to their children.Barry said: “At the moment we are confined to the multi. Rudi has mobility problems which are likely to get worse.\u0026#8220He uses a wheelchair intermittently, but being in a multi, even the first floor is not ideal. It seems people are declaring themselves homeless so they jump the queue.

The problem we’ve got is the council is unable to progress with the sale of sites in Whitfield for us to develop.“We could be building 120 more houses there but we can’t because they can’t sell the land.“The council own all of the land there and  they were able to progress with that quicker then we would be able to get houses built there. We are building four-in-a-block-type houses and semi-detached-style properties which are hugely popular and we get bombarded with applications for them.”The council insists it is making progress, with 527 units under construction.Kevin Cordell, convener of neighbourhood services – which includes housing – said: “We recognise the need for new affordable housing, that’s why we have committed to building 1,000 affordable new homes.“In Mill o’ Mains, Whitfield, Lochee and Hilltown, we have already built more than 200.“We are getting to grips with the problem of supply and demand by rebalancing the amount and type of housing on offer to the people of Dundee.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundees paul mcgowan weve not been good enough and need to change that against hibernian","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee’s players, it’s time to produce the goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss csaba pleased to have more options for falkirk clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo admits he is relieved to, finally, have close to a full squad to choose from.Csaba will have more at his disposal for the clash at Championship bottom side Falkirk today and could hand starts to key men Fraser Fyvie and Billy King.Both are rated touch and go while Sam Stanton, Nicky Clark and Stewart Murdoch are working their way back to full training.Csaba said: “We have spoken with Fraser and he still hasn’t decided but he is not far enough along psychologically but I think, definitely, he will be part of the squad.“We are looking to protect the player in the long term, not just one game.“It will be a decision between him and me.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient.

I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the contact.“I never went in to harm anybody and I think the red was brandished too quickly.“I have been in the game a long time but I have never gone in to hurt anybody.“It was an honest, genuine attempt to play the ball which I did.“So it is disappointing I am going to miss two games after just going to a new club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/41-Voyage-of-Discovery_maggies_penguin_parade_.jpg ","title":"this weekend farewell parade for maggies penguins in dundee ahead of auction","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNow really is your chance to p-p-p-pick up a penguin – for a great cause.Fans are preparing to say goodbye to the massively successful Maggie’s Penguin Parade this weekend before all 80 giant sculptures are auctioned at V\u0026ampA Dundee on Monday at 6.30pm.The full-size statues, plus 100 “baby” penguins, will be showcased at a farewell parade in the city’s Slessor Gardens today and Sunday.Each penguin has its own design – from Bonnie Dundee to Mr Sofishticated, Penguinstein and Hell’s Penguin.The project – which aims to raise half a million pounds for Maggie’s Dundee – challenged people to find all 80 penguin sculptures dotted throughout Dundee, Angus, Perthshire and Fe.All proceeds from the ticket-only Farewell Parade, which runs from 10am-5pm on both days, will also go to Maggie’s.Tickets are available from Dundee Box Office, by phone, online or in person on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"                          A BUS driver faces being sacked by Glasgow City Council after pulling over a coach load of Celtic fans to attack a rival motorist."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"country-legend-shania-twain-kicks-off-tour-in-glasgow-and-talks-storm-ali","story":"                          GLASGOW witnessed the spectacle of a letime with the arrival of country legend Shania Twain\u0027 highly-anticipated tour."},{"url":null,"title":"strictly-2018-tricky-tango-for-seann-walsh-as-strictly-returns","story":"                          STRICTLY is back tomorrow night \u0026ndash and 2018 contestant comedian Seann Walsh knows exactly who to ask for tips and advice."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-sturgeon-to-step-in-to-help-save-sauchiehall-street-after-blaze","story":"                          NICOLA Sturgeon has been asked to lead a national recovery plan for Sauchiehall Street as businesses fear they could go bust following the school of Art fire."},{"url":null,"title":"government-intends-to-contest-salmond-legal-action","story":"                          The Scottish Government has notied court officials it intends to contest Alex Salmond\u0027 legal action over its handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him."},{"url":null,"title":"paisley-museum-says-goodbye-to-public-as-works-get-underway-on-42m-revamp","story":"                          THE doors of Paisley Museum were locked for the last time yesterday as work gets underway on a \u0026pound42 million revamp of the historic visitor attraction."},{"url":null,"title":"sfa-and-diageo-team-up-to-promote-responsible-drinking","story":"                          The Scottish Football Association and drinks company Diageo have launched a campaign to promote responsible drinking."},{"url":null,"title":"graeme-mcgarry-can-leigh-griffiths-get-stuttering-celtic-firing-on-all-cylinders-again","story":"                          IT used to be said that at the Old Firm, you were never more than a defeat away from a crisis.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Saturday 22 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

damaged following the Go North East event held earlier this month near Milltimber.The Evening Express revealed workers are rectying issues – including cleaning up oil spills left on the new road and replacing tarmac which was damaged beyond repair.Days later workers remain on the site and the road surface has been ripped up, however transport bosses maintain the work is “minor” in nature and will not affect the overall timescale for the project.Peter Chapman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east region, said: “I think most people would look at these pictures and think it is far more than simply minor wear and tear.“It may well be covered by existing budgets, but I see no reason why the cost cannot be made public.”North East Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald called for more transparency on the repairs.He added: “Whatever works they need to do, they should endeavour to make sure they aren’t delaying the opening any further.“The public really deserves to know what is going on and they need to have some confidence that Transport Scotland are going to deliver the project as quickly as they safely can.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “A number of minor surfacing repairs are being undertaken as a result of damage and some defects present in the road surfacing.“Undertaking these repairs will not affect the completion of this section of road.“The contractor is undertaking a range of finishing works across the route including the completion of side roads, surfacing, access tracks, accommodation works, fencing and landscape planting.“The contractor will undertake any necessary remedial works to ensure that they are completed to the appropriate standard.”According to a project source, the road could have opened last month but did not, in order to accommodate the flagship event – which welcomed thousands of people including pedestrians and cyclists to the route.Transport Scotland previously declined to comment on the exact nature of the damage, how widespread it was or where it had taken place, adding: “Other than minor wear and tear incidents, which are not unexpected and easily rectied, no damage has been experienced as a result of the community event.”The source added that other sections of the road – including the stretch from Craibstone to Stonehaven – had been pencilled in to open in the days following the event and, with the exception of the new Don bridge which is undergoing remedial works, the rest of the route is now complete as far as construction goes.Transport chiefs have insisted the bypass is on target to open by late autumn although an official opening date has yet to be revealed.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali watch people struggle to stay on their feet as ferocious wind closes va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tV\u0026ampA

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

It is hoped that someone from the surrounding area might be interested in taking on the business and taking it forward in the long term.Andrea Henderson, who is co-ordinating the community effort to buy the shop, said: ‘The loss of our village shop and post office would be a great blow to the community, especially for those without transport who would need to make the 15-mile round trip to the nearest shop in Inveraray.\u0026#8216Local businesses also rely on the shop for its post office and wide range of goods on offer and would be greatly inconvenienced  they had to travel further for supplies.\u0026#8216We really hope that our grant will be approved and we can find someone to keep our village shop going.’Anyone interested in leasing the shop should contact Andrea by email on am.henderson@powdermills\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"investigation work for tarbert investment project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScottish Water’s plans to improve Tarbert’s sewer network and tackle flooding in the area are progressing with investigation works about to begin.The site investigations will inform the design and implementation of improvements needed to help reduce the risk of flooding in the village’s Harbour Street and Barmore Road.Work will be carried out by contractors on behalf of Scottish Water’s alliance partner amey Black and Veatch , and is expected to take four weeks.From Monday September 24, investigation work will be phased along Barmore Road from the Victoria Hotel to Harbour Street near to Loch Fyne Gallery.Full pedestrian access will be maintained, but temporary traffic lights and parking restrictions will be in place to enable this work to be carried out safely.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside. My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership.

delivered a major new education campus for Jedburgh.\nBut, having started her early teaching career in areas of deprivation, her passion for reducing inequality has led to a major drive in the Borders

early computer games and even a pair of Hunter wellington boots.\nThe 55-year-old former Galashiels Academy pupil is delighted to have been included in the collective story of great Scottish

collecting the Product Designer of the Year Medal from the SIAD Chartered Society of Designers.\nThree years later Neil gained his Masters degree in design at the Domus Academy in Milan.\nAfter relocating to Paris in 1991, he began to specialise in the design of \u0027deceptively simple-looking mass-produced objects\u0027.\nAnd there has been a steady flow of awards for his technology and lighting designs ever since.\nNeil\u0027s Scopas light, which was designed for Italian manufacturer Artemide, has already won awards in Europe and the USA.\nThe apparently incomplete suspension lamp is ever changing in its appearance, depending from where it is viewed.\nAnd it breaks the mould of monotonous forms that normally characterise this kind of central lamp.\nAs well as hanging in the new V\u0026ampA Museum, an interactive screen next to the exhibit allows visitors to deconstruct the Scopas design.\nNeil added: \"The virtual screen allows people to take the lamp to bits and then rebuild it on the screen.\n\"There have been schoolchildren taking my lamp to bits for most of the morning, which has been fun to watch.\"\nAs well as Neil\u0027s Scopas Lamp, the Scottish Design Galleries features a wide range of furniture, textiles, metalwork and ceramics, to fashion, architecture, engineering and digital design.\nJoanna Norman, Lead Curator of the Scottish Design Galleries, told us: \"The influence of Scottish design is not limited to one country, it has been felt around the world .\n\"Drawing on the V\u0026ampA\u0026rsquos world-famous collections of art, design and

Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is

Firebrick Brasserie, Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students.

Even the secretary of Jeremy\u0026rsquos allotment association is subject to mandatory reselection every 12 months.\nSpeaking after the NEC meeting, a Labour spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFollowing the democracy review, the NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at party conference to remove barriers to political participation and help transform our party into a mass movement for the many, not the few.\n\u0026ldquoThe democracy review is one of the biggest democratic exercises undertaken by any political party, with over 11,000 submissions and hundreds of consultation meetings held across the country.\nOther changes emerging from the review which will be put to a vote in Liverpool include\u0026nbspby-elections for NEC vacancies, new powers for\u0026nbspScottish and Welsh conference to determine how NEC representatives from the Scottish and Welsh parties are chosen and the creation of a disability place on the committee.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new Datea=s.createElement,m=s.getElementsByTagName[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBeforegagagagagagagagagaga, \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Changes to Labour leadership ballot rules agreed by ruling NEC\u0027\n"},{"url":null,"title":"labour-plans-new-laws-to-put-workers-on-boards","story":"A Labour government would require businesses to reserve one-third of seats on boards for representatives of their workforce, Jeremy Corbyn has announced.\nUnveiling the policy as Labour\u0026rsquos annual conference gets under way in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said it would give employees \u0026ldquoa real say in how companies are run and help rein in a \u0026ldquoreckless corporate culture.\nEmployee directors would be elected by the entire workforce and paid the same as other board members. They would be required to be members of recognised trade unions.\nUnder Labour\u0026rsquos plans, all companies with a workforce of 250 or more, whether public or private, would be required by law to reserve at least one third of places at the boardroom table for employee representatives, with a minimum of two.\nMr Corbyn said Theresa May had U-turned on her promise to put workers onto boards, watering down a pledge made in her 2016 leadership election campaign so that firms can instead nominate a non-executive director to represent employees.\nThe Labour leader said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWorkers are Britain\u0026rsquos real wealth creators. They deserve a seat at the table.\n\u0026ldquoIn workplaces across the country, working hours have got longer, productivity has noseed, pay has fallen and insecurity has risen.\n\u0026ldquoBusinesses have been allowed to get away with such exploitative practices because the balance of power has shted against workers. That has allowed a reckless corporate culture to fester which is damaging Britain\u0026rsquos economy.\n\u0026ldquoLabour will turn the tide and give workers more control and a real say at work. By ensuring businesses reserve a third of board seats for workers, we\u0026rsquoll help transform our broken economic model, as part of our plans to rebuild Britain for the many not the few.\nThe announcement forms part of an effort by Labour to use its Liverpool conference to make a direct pitch to working class communities, which it says have been held back by years of austerity and neglect.\nParty sources pointed to research showing that the\u0026nbspUK has the lowest average business investment of any G7 nation as a share of GDP.\nLabour blamed governance structures which give legal priority to shareholder interests over those of other stakeholders.

Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.  The plans will be revealed for the first time on Tuesday at Haddington\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre.  The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

Eight couples were paired up at the end of June and spent 10 weeks learning and perfecting their dance moves.  Jackie Gentil, who is principal teacher at Macmerry Primary School, was crowned the winner alongside her dance partner Jane Libberton.  Mairi O\u0026rsquoKeefe, Leuchie House CEO, said: \u0026ldquoWe are thrilled that Strictly Leuchie has raised so much for our charity again this year.  \u0026ldquoIt was a wonderful night and the dancers were incredible. To go from never having danced in public before to performing so well in front of a huge audience after only 10 weeks takes loads of hard work and commitment.  Joining Jackie on the dancefloor were Ali Wood , Alex Cunningham , Zoe Keddie-Dixon , Becky Everett , Callum Mark , Carol Fish , Joyce Lukkes-Presley  and Nicola Collin , along with seven professional dancers.  Each pair had a dferent dance style \u0026ndash such as the jive, pasodoble, samba, cha cha cha, Bollywood and Irish dance \u0026ndash to learn. After each couple had performed their routine, the audience voted for their three favourites.  Alex Cunningham and his partner Leigh Morrison, who performed a fast-paced Bollywood routine, which brought a touch of India to the Corn Exchange and Ali Wood, along with his partner Heather Antonelli, who did a salsa show dance to the soundtrack from The Greatest Showman, were announced as finalists alongside Jackie and Jane.  The audience then voted for a second time and chose Jackie and Jane and their high-kicking Irish dance as their winner.  Jackie, 46, who lives in Haddington with her husband and three sons, said she entered the competition after having a childhood desire to be in Pan\u0026rsquos People!  Her dance partner Jane is a mum-of-four from Dunbar. As well as working as a post lady for Royal Mail, she teaches Irish dancing at the Aine Hay Academy of Irish Dance. She devised and choreographed the winning dance routine to the song The Irish Rover.  This is the 11th year a Strictly-themed competition has been organised for charity by Bett Morrison, from Gford.  Tibor Poc and Hilary Mouat, the Scottish amateur ballroom and Latin American champions, performed two Latin American demonstration dances, with the Aine Hay Irish Academy and Dunbar School of Dance also entertaining.  Bett said: \u0026ldquoWhat a wonderful evening of dance and entertainment \u0026ndash such a iety of styles of dance.  \u0026ldquoWell done to everyone who took part and a special congratulations to the three couples who danced in the final \u0026ndash they were all amazing.  Former Scottish international rugby player Andy Irvine presented the winning couple with the Niall Fairgrieve Memorial Trophy, presented annually to the competition winners in memory of a much-missed local rugby player.  Mrs O\u0026rsquoKeefe added: \u0026ldquoWe are very grateful to them, to all their professional partners, the amazing Bett Morrison, to our special guest Andy Irvine, to all the volunteers who helped on the night, and all the many other people who were involved in making it such a huge success."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8719970.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"kavanaugh-accuser-agrees-to-give-evidence-to-senate-committee","story":"  But lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford said in a letter to the committee\u0026rsquos Republican majority that they want to continue discussing the terms of her appearance.

The changes, agreed unanimously by the NEC, will be put to a vote of delegates at conference on Sunday.  The NEC proposals do not cut the 10% threshold for MPs\u0026rsquo nominations required to get on to the ballot paper for a leadership contest.  But they add a new hurdle for would-be leaders, who also have to secure nominations from\u0026nbsp5% of constituency parties or 5% of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations.  There has been pressure from the left of the party for a cut in the number of MPs\u0026rsquo nominations required, in order to ensure the presence of a Corbynite candidate in any future contest. The hurdle was cut to 10% last year after Mr Corbyn struggled to secure the 15% needed in 2015.  Reform to the leadership ballot rules is understood to have won overwhelming support in the democracy review ordered by Mr Corbyn, which is due to be published on Sunday.  The new rule will mean future candidates having to build support among grassroots activists and trade unionists as well as at Parliament.  Under the reselection proposals, the threshold to force sitting MPs to fight open selection battles will be cut from 50% to 33% of local branches or affiliated unions.  Labour MPs currently face a so-called \u0026ldquotrigger ballot before each general election, but must only fight for their position  a majority of local branches and affiliated unions back an open selection contest. The new change will require an open contest  either 33% of local party branches or 33% of affiliated trade union branches demand one.  The reform falls short of the demands of some activists who are seeking mandatory open selection contests for all MPs before every election.  Their campaign is seen by many MPs on the right of the party as an effort to purge \u0026ldquoBlairite influences and critics of Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos handling of issues such as anti-Semitism.  A Labour source said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe proposal agreed unanimously by the NEC reforms the existing reselection process, giving members and trade union affiliates a greater say in who represents them, but doesn\u0026rsquot move to automatic open selections.  A meeting of supporters of mandatory selection contests on the fringe of the Liverpool contest heard close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson ask: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos wrong with giving members a chance to decide who will be their candidate in each election?  \u0026ldquoIt happens in every community organisation and trade union I can think of. Even the secretary of Jeremy\u0026rsquos allotment association is subject to mandatory reselection every 12 months.  Speaking after the NEC meeting, a Labour spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFollowing the democracy review, the NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at party conference to remove barriers to political participation and help transform our party into a mass movement for the many, not the few.  \u0026ldquoThe democracy review is one of the biggest democratic exercises undertaken by any political party, with over 11,000 submissions and hundreds of consultation meetings held across the country.  Other changes emerging from the review which will be put to a vote in Liverpool include\u0026nbspby-elections for NEC vacancies, new powers for\u0026nbspScottish and Welsh conference to determine how NEC representatives from the Scottish and Welsh parties are chosen and the creation of a disability place on the committee."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8720249.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"labour-plans-new-laws-to-put-workers-on-boards","story":"  Unveiling the policy as Labour\u0026rsquos annual conference gets under way in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said it would give employees \u0026ldquoa real say in how companies are run and help rein in a \u0026ldquoreckless corporate culture.  Employee directors would be elected by the entire workforce and paid the same as other board members. They would be required to be members of recognised trade unions.  Under Labour\u0026rsquos plans, all companies with a workforce of 250 or more, whether public or private, would be required by law to reserve at least one third of places at the boardroom table for employee representatives, with a minimum of two.  Mr Corbyn said Theresa May had U-turned on her promise to put workers onto boards, watering down a pledge made in her 2016 leadership election campaign so that firms can instead nominate a non-executive director to represent employees.  The Labour leader said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWorkers are Britain\u0026rsquos real wealth creators. They deserve a seat at the table.  \u0026ldquoIn workplaces across the country, working hours have got longer, productivity has noseed, pay has fallen and insecurity has risen.  \u0026ldquoBusinesses have been allowed to get away with such exploitative practices because the balance of power has shted against workers. That has allowed a reckless corporate culture to fester which is damaging Britain\u0026rsquos economy.  \u0026ldquoLabour will turn the tide and give workers more control and a real say at work. By ensuring businesses reserve a third of board seats for workers, we\u0026rsquoll help transform our broken economic model, as part of our plans to rebuild Britain for the many not the few.  The announcement forms part of an effort by Labour to use its Liverpool conference to make a direct pitch to working class communities, which it says have been held back by years of austerity and neglect.  Party sources pointed to research showing that the\u0026nbspUK has the lowest average business investment of any G7 nation as a share of GDP.  Labour blamed governance structures which give legal priority to shareholder interests over those of other stakeholders.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-theresa-may-stumbles-in-salzburg-as-eu27-says-chequers-plan-unworkable","story":"  Eyes jumping from side to side, nostrils flaring and hands gesticulating, the Prime Minister was screaming inside. Her frustration at trying to square the seemingly impossible Brussels circle was clear for all to see.  Perspiring in a sultry press conference room, Theresa May could not hid her anger following the \u0026ldquofrank exchanges she had had minutes earlier with Donald Tusk, the leader of the EU leaders, who publicly and coolly delivered the last rites to her Chequers Plan.  UK diplomatic sources had expected a bust-up but thought it would come at the October 18/19 European Council. The breakdown now at least gives the UK negotiators more time before the very final deadline of mid-November.  The Prime Minister confirmed that the UK was building up a new proposal to unblock the logjam on the Irish border issue.  It is thought this would entail having \u0026ldquoregulatory checks at Irish Sea ports these are technically dferent but similar to customs checks. Such checks already exist between Northern Ireland and the British mainland in regard to agricultural products.  The hope must be with this suggestion and the EU\u0026rsquos pledge to \u0026ldquode-dramatise its own backstop plan, there is a chance that they could meet somewhere in the middle to prevent a hard border with Ireland and avoid a no-deal Brexit.  Yet the key will be not just whether Brussels can accept what many would regard a fudge but also whether the Democratic Unionists, who just so happen provide the PM with her Commons majority, will be able to do so.  The Salzburg rejection now leaves Mrs May looking bruised and battered, seeking friends where few can be found for her compromise. Brexiteers hate it, Remainers hate it, Brussels hates it.  And the timing could not be worse.  In just over a week\u0026rsquos time the Tories gather in Birmingham for what one MP helpfully dubbed a \u0026ldquoBrexit bloodbath.  Various colleagues will be \u0026ldquoon manoeuvres, sensing the smell of political blood, not least Boris Johnson, who has his Chuck Chequers rally before the party leader gives her keynote speech.  Her aides will be making sure there will be plenty of water and cough toffees on the lectern and, instead of letters on the backdrop, there will be a projected message.  If the Maybot can survive the Tory turmoil in Birmingham, there will be just two weeks to reset her plan to try to get the EU27 on board.  Of course, it may be that the old political rouse is being worked here: make things look so desperately bad that when victory is seized from the jaws of defeat at the last moment, the sense of achievement and relief is all the greater.  Or, it could be as bad as it looks."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8713655.jpg?type=article-full","title":"shelter-scotland-declares-national-housing-emergency","story":"  More people than ever before were given advice by Shelter Scotland after approaching the charity over worries they would not be able to keep a roof over their heads, or were already facing le on the streets.  The rise in people fearing homelessness has been blamed on harsh welfare cuts, the high cost of keeping a home, stagnant wages and a shortage of affordable houses on the market.  Graeme Brown, Director of Shelter Scotland, said that rough sleepers were \"dying on the streets\" and called for greater action to tackle homelessness.  He said: \u0026ldquoLast year we had to help more people than ever before, which is why, in our 50th anniversary year, we\u0026rsquore not celebrating.  \"We thought that by now bad housing and homelessness would be largely a thing of the past, but instead our services are needed more than ever.\"  :\u0026nbspHomeless given help to access Universal Credit online    The charity\u0027s annual report revealed that it provided help to 21,290 people last year, an all-time high. Its website was accessed at a rate of 17,000 times per week with demands for information, with half of those getting in contact saying they needed advice on how to\u0026nbspkeep their homes.  Nearly two in three people who came to the charity were women, with the majority speaking of\u0026nbspstruggling to afford housing costs as the biggest problem they faced.  The pressures were revealed to be nationwide. In formerly oil-rich Aberdeen, hit hard by the downturn in the industry, 70 per cent of all calls were from people worried about losing their home, the highest figure in the country.  The spike the numbers turning to the charity for aid comes after the number of applications for homelessness in Scotland rose for the first time in nearly a decade this year.  The Shelter Scotland\u0026nbspreport also contained a warning of a ticking timebomb, with young people making up nearly half of those who sought advice about homelessness last year.  :\u0026nbsp38 children a day made homeless last year    Mr Brown added: \"The number of homeless children is at a 10-year high. Unknown numbers are sofa surfing with friends and families as they don\u0026rsquot have, or cannot afford, a home of their own.  \u0026ldquoBehind those statistics are people, families, iniduals \u0026ndash people on low incomes, people with complex needs, people in crisis - some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  \u0026ldquoThese are the people we help day-in, day-out and, until there\u0026rsquos a decent, safe and secure home for everyone, we\u0026rsquoll carry on fighting for everyone in Scotland facing bad housing and homelessness.  Almost 40 per cent of those appealing for help were private renters \u0026ndash a disproportionately high number compared to the size of the private rental sector, which makes up just 15 per cent of all housing in Scotland.  Clients were helped via Shelter Scotland\u0027s free national helpdesk, digital chat service and one-to-one advice sessions.

He said: \"There is without question more people feeling a heightened level of anxiety about their home, their jobs and their relationships.  \"As the Shelter reports says, we are encountering more people under greater pressure than ever before because of the ongoing policies of austerity.  \"And it\u0027s not just the number of people finding themselves without a roof over their heads.

Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior judge said the question, previously dismissed by government lawyers as \u0026ldquohypothetical and academic, should be referred as a matter of urgency to the European Court of Justice  before Westminster votes on the final Brexit deal.  If the ECJ rules that Parliament can revoke the Article 50 withdrawal process without the permission of the other 27 EU states, it could, in theory, result in MPs stopping Brexit.  In practice, parliamentarians would be reluctant to overturn the result of the EU referendum.\u0026nbsp  However, having the option available would reduce the chance of a chaotic no-deal Brexit  talks between the UK and EU were to collapse.\u0026nbsp  That in turn would undermine the UK negotiating position in Brussels.  Theresa May was told by EU leaders on Thursday that her Chequers\u0026nbspPlan for a soft Brexit \u0026ldquowill not work because its cherry-picking approach risks undermining the single market.  The snub humiliated and wounded the Prime Minister ahead of next week\u0026rsquos Tory conference.  In the words of EU Council President Donald Tusk, it also turned the next EU summit in mid-October into a \u0026ldquomoment of truth for Brexit.  Speaking in Downing Street yesterday, Mrs May demanded ideas, details and \u0026ldquorespect from the EU in order to break the impasse over trade relations and the Irish border.\u0026nbsp  Her warning that the EU\u0026rsquos two current proposals both represented a bad deal, and that no deal remained better than a bad deal, led to an\u0026nbsp  immediate drop in the value of the pound.  Mr Tusk said in reply he was a \u0026ldquotrue admirer of PM May, but also that the UK was warned about \u0026ldquoevery detail of the EU\u0026rsquos objections to Chequers weeks ago.  The legal battle was led by Green MSP Andy Wightman, alongside his fellow Green MSP Ross Greer, Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, and SNP MEP Alyn Smith.  The SNP MP Joanna Cherry, QC, and Scottish LibDem MP\u0026nbspChristine Jardine were also involved.  They asked the Court of Session for a reference to the ECJ on whether parliamentarians could instruct the UK Government to withdraw the Article 50 notication underlying Brexit.  Their case was initially dismissed, but they won an appeal heard by the Lord President Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.\u0026nbsp  It is understood the UK Government could appeal the decision to the UK Supreme Court, however no decision has yet been taken.  A Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are disappointed by the decision of the court. We are giving it careful consideration. But as the Government has repeatedly said, we are committed to implementing the result of the referendum and will not be revoking Article 50.  Earlier this year, lawyers acting for the Government claimed the politicians\u0026rsquo petition did not reflect political reality on the ground.  In June, Lord Boyd agreed, saying revoking Article 50 was not \u0026ldquoa live practical question and the group\u0026rsquos petition was \u0026ldquoa clear and dangerous encroachment on the sovereignty of Parliament, as it was up to Parliament to decide  it wanted an ECJ ruling.  However in a written appeal\u0026nbspjudgment, Lord Carloway said the question of revocation was \u0026ldquoneither academic not premature as matters had moved on, and asking the ECJ\u0026nbspfor a preliminary ruling was \u0026ldquonecessary.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoIt is clear in terms of the EU  Act 2018, that MPs will be required to vote on whether to raty any agreement between the UK Government and EU council.  \u0026ldquoIf no other proposal is proffered, a vote against ratication will result in the UK\u0026rsquos departure from the EU on March 29, 2019, a date which is looming up. It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notication and thus to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPs\u0026nbsp  in the lead up to what is now an\u0026nbspinevitable vote.  Lord Carloway included a draft text of the reference to the ECJ which asked the court whether EU law permits an Article 50 notice \u0026ldquoto be revoked unilaterally by an EU member state after it has notied its withdrawal and,  so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the Member State remaining within the EU.\u0026nbsp  It also requested an \u0026ldquoexpedited procedure in \u0026ldquolight of the urgency of the urgency of the issue in terms of parliamentary consideration and voting in advance of 29 March 2019.  Concurring, Lord Drummond Young said that  MPs were to vote responsibly, \u0026ldquoit is surely obvious that they should be properly advised as to the existing legal position...\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoIn these circumstances it cannot be said in my opinion that the question of revocation of the Article 50 notication is merely academic or hypothetical.  In his opinion, Lord Menzies said he was \u0026ldquoin complete agreement with the Lord President\u0026rsquos conclusions, reasoning and solution.  Good Law Project director Jolyon Maugham QC, who helped bring the case, said the ruling showed it was \u0026ldquonot too late to wake up from the nightmare that is this government\u0026rsquos Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Mr Greer said: \u0026ldquoThis is about ensuring MPs are fully informed of their options at this time of national crisis. If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a No-Deal disaster is not the only option on the table.  Ms Cherry said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos vital for MPs to know whether Article 50 is unilaterally revocable before they are asked to raty any agreement between the UK and the EU Council.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoGiven Theresa May\u0026rsquos humiliation in Salzburg the answer to this question is particularly important.  LibDem MP Tom Brake and Labour MP Chris Leslie were also part of the legal action.  Mr Brake said: \u0026ldquoThe European Court now has the opportunity to confirm that the UK can unilaterally withdraw the Article 50 notice, something the government has constantly refused to admit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThis would establish the UK\u0026rsquos options to decide its approach to Brexit, democratically and positively, and underline that the choice for the UK is wider than just a revised version of Chequers or \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo. This will be critical for Parliament over the next three months.  Mr Leslie added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear that Parliament is going to have to step in and take over this process from Theresa May. If we\u0026rsquore to do this and put the country first, we need MPs to realise that is not irreversible now. We cannot afford to be articially constrained by the narrow view of a few Government Ministers with their own agenda any longer.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-reveals-harassment-case-numbers","story":"  Official data also revealed there have been up to 41 such cases since 2013 in the government\u0026rsquos central directorates, which employ around 5200 people.  The government said there had been up to four cases in both 2013 and 2014, nine cases in 2015, ten in 2016, and seven in both 2017 and 2018.  As of 2 July there were \u0026ldquoseven live internal harassment and/or bullying cases, it said.  The information was released in response to a freedom of information request.  In response to a separate parliamentary question from Labour MSP Monica Lennon, the government said it knew of 11 formal complaints of sexual harassment by staff since 2007.  It said it had no record of such complaints against ministers since 1999 and the end of 2017, and no record of any such complaints against their special advisers since 2007.  The 11 complaints against staff since 2007 covered the core government departments and a series of smaller civil servant operations which currently employ around 6850 staff.  It said the cases \u0026ldquowere dealt with in line with the relevant internal procedures.  The information emerged as the government answered a series of freedom of information requests, many lodged by the opposition parties, about Alex Salmond.  The former First Minister was accused by two women in January of sexual misconduct relating to his time in office in 2013.  He has denied harassment and criminality and is taking legal action against the government and its top official, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, over the handling of the case.  Backed by a \u0026pound100,000 crowdfunded appeal, he is seeking a judicial review of the complaint handling process, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the allegations.  The Scottish Government issued similar responses to around a dozen FoI requests asking for details of what ministers knew about the case, records and correspondence.  The government repeatedly said it \u0026ldquocannot confirm or deny whether any information is held as disclosure \u0026ldquowould be likely to prejudice substantially the administration of justice.  Questions about when and how many times Ms Sturgeon met Mr Salmond and discussed his case after the complaints were lodged were rebuffed on this basis.  Mr Salmond has said he raised his case three times in person with Ms Sturgeon, and was the first person to inform her that he was the subject of the complaints.  The government also cited exemptions from FoI law when asked for any correspondence between Ms Sturgeons and her husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, on the case.  The government this week notied the Court of Session that it intended to defend Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos action \u0026ldquovigorously, although it did not object to him bringing it in the first place.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"We have processes in place for any employee to report bullying and harassment which they may have experienced in the workplace \u0026ndash and we have detailed the very extensive support which is in place for any employee who needs it.  \"The Scottish Government and the civil service unions share a clear commitment to ensuring that there is no place for bullying and harassment in the workplace.\""},{"url":null,"title":"prime-minister-says-uk-and-eu-are-long-way-apart-on-two-main-issues","story":"              Theresa May has called on the EU to come forward with fresh proposals on Northern Ireland and trade, warning that without a move from Brussels it will not be possible to make further progress in Brexit talks.

It follows Mr Corbyn blundering over his party\u0026rsquos position on independence on Thursday.  Despite Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocast iron guarantee against ending the Union at the last election, Mr Corbyn said he was \u0026ldquonot ruling out another referendum  he become Prime Minister.  However he also said he didn\u0027t want a referendum.  His comments, which echoed a previous departure from the Scottish party line last year, prompted Tory claims that Labour was \u0026ldquoutterly weak on the Union.  Mr Leonard is due to address an activist rally at the UK Labour conference in Liverpool tomorrow night and give the Scotland report to delegates on Monday.  He said the SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission, its revised economic blueprint for independence, offered a vision of Scotland that people didn\u0026rsquot want and couldn\u0026rsquot afford.  The document proposes a decade of tight public spending to halve Scotland\u0026rsquos deficit.  Mr Leonard said: \u0026ldquoIt is a prospectus based on a hard decade of public spending contraction, and even deeper cuts than those implemented by George Osborne.  \u0026ldquoProposing a separate Scotland seeking to use the pound informally is a recipe for instability and is the economics of dereliction.  \u0026ldquoThis prospectus for independence is not built on sovereignty regained but on sovereignty lost: on interest rates, mortgage rates, inflation, and corporation tax policy.  \u0026ldquoAnd it is based on an economic model which relies heavily on foreign direct investment, large multinational corporations and labour market flexicurity.  \u0026ldquoThat is not the sort of future the people of Scotland want. We need now to stop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said Mr Leonard needed to clary whether he shared Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos position on another referendum.  He said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos weak admission that he wants the SNP to have another independence vote is a direct contradiction of Labour\u0026rsquos 2017 manesto.  \u0026ldquoRichard Leonard has to now clary what his party\u0026rsquos position on this vital matter is.  \u0026ldquoIs he going to stand up for the majority of Scots who want to keep the UK together, or is he too afraid to go against the wishes of his boss in London?

Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said Mr Corbyn was making \"all the wrong calls\" on independence - and on Brexit, by ignoring demands for a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  He said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn seems totally out of touch in Scotland. He\u0026rsquos making all the wrong calls on both Brexit and independence.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos fanning the flames of the nationalist movement at just the moment when all opposition parties should be banding together against a Conservative hard Brexit.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-gas-headquarters-chemical-incident-leaves-13-needing-treatment","story":"  The Scottish Gas headquarters in\u0026nbspWaterfront Avenue in the Granton area was evacuated as fire crews investigated the cause.

Mr Leslie who sits as an Aligned Independent councillor, was suspended by the Scottish Conservative party until next year over unpaid council tax.  His daughter, Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, lived at the castle, which is near Insch, as a child.  A decree for the repossession of the castle, which is also listed on rental site Airbnb where it is described as \"quirky and fun\", was granted during a civil hearing at Aberdeen Sherf Court on Thursday.  Court documents revealed the pursuer in the case, Together Commercial Finance Limited, asked the court to find Mr Leslie in default for failing to comply with calling-up notices - a legal document ending a mortgage agreement, requiring repayment of all of the outstanding loan.  The court was asked to rule that the firm has the right to enter into possession and sell Lickleyhead Castle, which has been a popular spot for weddings, as well as the Gardeners or Gamekeepers Cottage and land at Premnay, Insch.  The court was also asked to agree that Mr Leslie, his family and anyone else occupying the castle should leave it, and to allow officers of the court to eject the occupants and their goods.  The decree was granted by Sherf Andrew Miller. Mr Leslie was not present for the hearing but submitted an email confirming there was no objection.  It comes after the councillor was also due to appear at the civil court last week for a  time-to-pay hearing.  The West Garioch councillor was not present and Sherf Morag McLaughlin granted a decree ordering him to pay \u0026pound4,214.50 plus interest and expenses to a chartered surveyor.  Court documents prepared by John Fraser, the claimant, stated \u0026pound500 had been paid towards the total bill of \u0026pound4,714.50 for inspections carried out and reports prepared on Mr Leslie\u0027s properties.  The property was put on the market in 2013 for \u0026pound1.3 million.  At the time, selling agents said the Leslies lived in another nearby castle but used Lickleyhead for weddings and s, and put the property on the market because it was \"surplus to their requirements\".  It has passed through a succession of owners including Patrick Duff, the uncle of the Earl of Fe.  Former governor of Mexico City Don Guillermo de Landa y Escandon bought the property in 1922 for his daughter Maria Luz, who married into the Arbuthnot-Leslie family.

She said that  she had to select a favourite it would be Sunset Song, which is acclaimed for its starkly beautul portrait of rural le in north-east Scotland at the start of the 20th century.  Ms Sturgeon also told audience members that her first experience of getting lost in stories was when she read Enid Blyton, author of the Famous Five and Secret Seven series.  And she revealed that her earliest memory of books involved her hiding under the table and reading at her own fth birthday party. Politics was touched upon briefly as the First Minister made a light-hearted  pointed reference to yesterday\u0026rsquos combative statement from Prime Minister Theresa May after her Brexit plan was rejected by the EU.

Some opposition politicians argued the move would be a violation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u0026rsquos mini-constitution under which it retained its own legal system and civil liberties after reverting from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler has unveiled plans to establish a standalone department for women and equalities with a minister at the Cabinet table in a future Labour government.  But the main conference is expected to be dominated by squabbles over Brexit and the future of the party.

The party\u0026rsquos National Executive Committee  will meet on Saturday to discuss changes to leadership election rules, which left-wing activists claim could keep supporters of Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0026nbspoff the ballot.  At the same time, the activist group Momentum which helped propel Mr Corbyn to the leadership is pushing for another rule change which could make it easier to de-select sitting MPs.  It is likely to revive fears among critics of Mr Corbyn of a left-wing purge of the moderates \u0026ndash including some of his fiercest critics in the row over anti-Semitism.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down. The reception has been great. The delight on the children\u0026rsquos faces is magical and we\u0026rsquove got more fairy houses coming.\"Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to. That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations. My son gave a presentation at the end of the day about the plans for equipment and we were successful getting the maximum \u0026pound2500 available.\"Ullapool Harbour trust also chipped in \u0026pound1000 to the cause.The group set itself an initial target of \u0026pound7000. It then submitted a bid for lottery funding of \u0026pound7500, which it has just been awarded.\u0026nbspIt\u0026rsquos hoped the new equipment could again be located in the tennis court for part of the year.Mr Crook said: \"It\u0026rsquos a facility that was well-received. The company that provides the equipment does a number of layouts so it\u0026rsquos a question of deciding what we can afford and then placing an order. It will, I\u0026rsquom sure, be very well used.\"Saturday 22 Sep 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on trade or customs has intensied after Theresa May admitted yesterday that negotiations are at an \u0026#8220impasse\u0026#8221 and accused European leaders of a lack of respect.                In a bullish statement delivered the day after her humiliating rebuff from EU leaders in Salzburg, the Prime Minister warned that EU officials must now come forward with fresh proposals before any progress can resume.            After her address, the Conservative leader faced claims her negotiating strategy  was “collapsing around her” and that she was in denial over the shortcomings in her own so-called Chequers compromise deal.            Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned a no deal Brexit will mean “huge damage” for the UK and result in a “heavy political price” for the Tories north of the Border.But Mrs May insisted that EU proposals for a post-Brexit economic deal could lead to the “break up” of the UK and said this was “unacceptable” during the defiant seven-minute address. The Prime Minister cut a beleaguered figure after EU leaders  dismissed her “Chequers proposal” as unworkable at a flagship summit in Austria on Thursday. Yesterday Mrs May warned: “The EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum - nor will I break up my country.”The pound plummeted following Mrs May’s speech, giving up four days of gains on the US dollar to shed 1.5 per cent and close at 1.30 in London. Versus the euro, the British currency was down over 1 per cent at 1.11.A no deal Brexit would mean costly tarfs on the import of goods to the EU and has prompted warnings that it could cost up to 80,000 jobs in Scotland alone and cost the economy billions of pounds.            But such a scenario seems increasingly likely as relations between the EU and UK appear to have hit rock bottom just six months ahead of the UK’s scheduled departure from the Brussels bloc next March. Mrs May dismissed EU suggestions that the onus is on Britain to sht its stance, insisting that the ball is now in the European Union’s court.The key barriers to a deal are the future economic arrangements and the Irish border problem. If the UK remains in the European Economic area , or single market, it loses the freedom to restrict immigration from the EU and to sign  global trade deals. Alternatively, a free trade deal outside the EEA would see an effective border created in the Irish Sea, effectively segregating the UK from Northern Ireland, according to Mrs May. “Neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other,” she warned.            “We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.“We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens. Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.”The UK is ready to come forward with “new ideas” on unblocking the disagreement over future arrangements at the Irish border, Mrs May insisted.Her position was welcomed by Democratic Unionist Party  leader Arlene Foster, who said: “The Prime Minister is right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union. The United Kingdom will not be treated in such a manner.”But Sinn Fein President Mary-Lou McDonald said: “Rather than accepting that her so-called ‘Chequers Plan’ fails to resolve fundamental issues, Theresa May has engaged in deflection.            “Her focus has unfortunately remained on infighting within her own party and her pact with the DUP, instead of coming to an acceptable negotiating position.”European Council President Donald Tusk’s assertion last week that the Chequers plan “will not work” also met with a stinging rebuke from the UK Prime Minister.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and new proposals,” she said.“So we now need to hear from the European Union what the real issues are and what their proposals are so we can discuss them.“Until we do, we can’t make progress.”The UK government will now continue the work of “preparing ourselves for no deal,” The Prime Minister added.The three million EU citizens living in the UK will have their rights protected, Mrs May added, with a pledge that she will seek to avoid a  to a hard border in Ireland under such a scenario.But opponents insisted that Mrs May has placed too much faith in her own Chequers deal which sought to allow frictionless trade, but would leave Britain to have control over EU immigration and make its own laws.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803826.1537597925!/image/image.jpg","title":"norwegian to scrap us budget flights from edinburgh","story":"        Three Edinburgh air routes including US axed by Norwegian                Budget airline Norwegian is to axe the last of its three US routes from Edinburgh which were launched only last year, The Scotsman can reveal.

The airline also flies to Copenhagen, Malaga, Oslo and Stockholm from Edinburgh.BACKGROUND: Norwegian to axe a US route from Edinburgh over tax cut delaysA Norwegian spokesman told The Scotsman: \"After careful consideration, we have decided to withdraw our transatlantic routes.\"Air passenger duty was the main factor, as it meant that fares were higher than we’d like them to be, which affected the profitability of these routes.\"When we compare it to performance on identical routes from Ireland , fares are lower, and profitability is higher in those markets compared to Scotland.\"Our Edinburgh routes to Spain will also be withdrawn from next summer.            \"None of these summer 2019 flights are currently on sale.\"The cuts are a reminder to everyone of what is at stake for Scotland’s connectivity  the APD issue isn’t tackled.\"BACKGROUND: Second US route from Edinburgh halted by Norwegian AirThe airline said its US routes had been launched \"with the prospect of a reduction in air passenger taxes that was unfortunately postponed by The Scottish Government and this has led us to fully withdraw our transatlantic services.\"It added: \"We continually monitor and evaluate routes across our network, and as such we have also decided to withdraw routes from Edinburgh to Barcelona and Tenere allowing us to focus on maintaining better-performing flights to Scandinavia.\"Edinburgh-based crew will be offered potential relocation to the airline\u0027s other bases.\"Three other airlines fly to New York from Edinburgh and Norwegian faced multiple airline competition on the other routes it is ending.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: “This is a desperately disappointing decision, entirely caused by a complete failure of the Scottish Government to live up to its commitment to reduce the tax paid by Scots travellers. “This failure diminishes choice for passengers and is a shot in the arm for European cities already relishing Britain’s isolation from mainland Europe.“It is not too late to deliver on commitments made before Scotland loses out further, both in terms of jobs and tourism revenue.“The administrations in Holyrood and Westminster must come together now and focus not just on why things can’t be done, but on fixing this intolerable situation.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT.

If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSaturday 22 Sep 2018 10:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

Such a move would require their MPs to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning British monarch.\nDeputy Martin made the remarks after he was asked about the possibility of Fianna Fáil merging with the Social Democratic and Labour Party  to contest elections north of the border.\nSpeaking to reporters in Malahide, Martin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.\nBefore taking a seat in Wesminster, successful MPs must swear either an oath of allegiance or a solemn affirmation to “be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors”.\nIn February, Fianna Fáil held an event to honour Constance Markievicz who 100 years previously became the first woman MP when she was elected to Westminster as the Sinn Féin MP for the St Patrick’s ward of Dublin. She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.\nSinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.\nResponding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March 2018:\n“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the

ni leisure show springs into action with fun fuelled launch","story":"\nLocal man Billy Nutt welcomed traders and exhibitors alike to the adrenaline-packed launch, which featured a spectacular parkour demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

He has two other units - one in Ballymena and another in Randalstown. \n\nThe singer and former Celebrity Masterchef contestant attended an event to celebrate his new venture at The Chelsea on the Lisburn Road.\n\nTalking to the Belfast , Shane, who opened his first Amen store last autumn, said: \"I didn\u0027t think the business would grow so fast but over the past 12 months but it has just taken off. I have good business partners from here so that\u0027s why I chose Northern Ireland as a location.\"\n\nSpeaking about his choice of sites, he added: \"I could\u0027ve opened in Belfast because it\u0027s the Mecca but I like to invest in smaller locations, and give back.\n\n\"I like Northern Ireland. I always find myself attracted to here and it\u0027s a great place to do business.\"\n\nShane, who is preparing for a final tour with Boyzone and will release, as part of the band, his last ever album, said his new store was ruffling the feathers of other footwear brands. \n\n\"I\u0027m already receiving phone calls about the cost of our products. Our shoes retail for around £39.99 and the industry standard for similar shoes also made of Italian leather would be £150. I\u0027m not going to sell them for that price when I know how much it costs to make them. \n\n\"For me it\u0027s about offering bargains. I never fell into that trap of buying designer clothing and I\u0027m not high fashion. Anything I create, I always try to be the best at it for the least.\"\n\nBoyzone\u0027s 25th Anniversary and Farewell Arena Tour commences in Belfast on January 23.\n\nAnd in November the band will release their last album, Thank You \u0026 Goodnight.\n\nShane, a father of two, said he \"felt good\" about the final tour with his pals but said he may feel dferently after the final performance.\n\n\"Ending it defines things for all of us.

The hurdle was cut to 10% last year after Mr Corbyn struggled to secure the 15% needed in 2015.\n\nReform to the leadership ballot rules is understood to have won overwhelming support in the democracy review ordered by Mr Corbyn, which is due to be published on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at party conference to remove barriers to political participation\nLabour spokesman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rule will mean future candidates having to build support among grassroots activists and trade unionists as well as at Parliament.\n\nUnder the reselection proposals, the threshold to force sitting MPs to fight open selection battles will be cut from 50% to 33% of local branches or affiliated unions.\n\nLabour MPs currently face a so-called “trigger ballot” before each general election, but must only fight for their position  a majority of local branches and affiliated unions back an open selection contest. The new change will require an open contest  either 33% of local party branches or 33% of affiliated trade union branches demand one.\n\nThe reform falls short of the demands of some activists who are seeking mandatory open selection contests for all MPs before every election.\n\nTheir campaign is seen by many MPs on the right of the party as an effort to purge “Blairite” influences and critics of Mr Corbyn’s handling of issues such as anti-Semitism.\n\nA Labour source said: “The proposal agreed unanimously by the NEC reforms the existing reselection process, giving members and trade union affiliates a greater say in who represents them, but doesn’t move to automatic open selections.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn met football fans during a visit to Liverpool’s Anfield stadium \n\n\n\n\nA meeting of supporters of mandatory selection contests on the fringe of the Liverpool contest heard close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson ask: “What’s wrong with giving members a chance to decide who will be their candidate in each election?\n\n“It happens in every community organisation and trade union I can think of. Even the secretary of Jeremy’s allotment association is subject to mandatory reselection every 12 months.”\n\nSpeaking after the NEC meeting, a Labour spokesman said: “Following the democracy review, the NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at party conference to remove barriers to political participation and help transform our party into a mass movement for the many, not the few.\n\n“The democracy review is one of the biggest democratic exercises undertaken by any political party, with over 11,000 submissions and hundreds of consultation meetings held across the country.”\n\nOther changes emerging from the review which will be put to a vote in Liverpool include by-elections for NEC vacancies, new powers for Scottish and Welsh conference to determine how NEC representatives from the Scottish and Welsh parties are chosen and the creation of a disability place on the committee.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"10 moving images people think would make","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It is understood the day she will give evidence, and whether she will do so in public, remain up for discussion.\n\nThe committee has pencilled in a possible vote to decide whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for Monday.\n\nA senior official at the White House said the letter amounts to “an ask to continue ‘negotiations’ without committing to anything”.\n\nHe added: “It’s a clever way to push off the vote Monday without committing to appear Wednesday.”.\n\nMs Ford, a 51-year-old Calornia psychology professor, claims an inebriated Mr Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, muffled her cries and tried removing her clothes when they were both teenagers in the 1980s.\n\nMr Kavanaugh, a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\n\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don’t matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C.\n— Donald J. Trump  \nSeptember 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who nominated Mr Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, has waded into the issue, claiming that  the alleged attack was that “bad”, she would have filed charges at the time.\n\nHe tweeted on Friday: “I have no doubt that,  the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!”\n\nOn Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence described Mr Kavanaugh as “a man of integrity with impeccable credentials”.\n\nHe said the judge’s record and career deserve “the respect of every member of the United States Senate”.\n\nHe made no reference to Ms Ford, but he said he is confident Mr Kavanaugh will soon join the high court.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands rally across russia against pension age rise","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

attended a Moscow rally organised by the Communist Party and other groups, which was authorised by city officials.\n\nCommunist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov called for the proposed changes to be rolled back, arguing that the government should redistribute resources to avoid raising the pension age.\n\n“They keep reaching into your pockets,” he told the crowd, which had many waving red flags.\n\nSimilar protests were also held in cities across Russia’s 11 time zones and most of them were also sanctioned by authorities.\n\nThe demonstrations went on peacefully, unlike a wave of unauthorised pension protests earlier this month organised by opposition leader Alexei Navalny that led to the detention of more than 1,000 people across Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAlexei Navalny is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most visible foe\n\n\n\n\nNavalny, the anti-corruption activist who is Putin’s most visible foe, had called for protests against the pension age hike before he was sentenced to 30 days in jail for organising a January protest over a dferent issue.\n\nHe is set to be released from custody on Monday.\n\nThe government’s plan to lt the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women has angered a wide range of Russians from all political factions.\n\nOlder Russians fear they will not live long enough to collect signicant benefits while younger generations are worried that keeping people in the workforce longer will limit their own employment opportunities.\n\nThe proposal has dented President Vladimir Putin’s popularity.\n\nHe responded by offering some concessions, but argued that the age hike is necessary because rising le expectancy in Russia could exhaust the nation’s pension resources  the eligibility age remains the same.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"collaboration change event inspired 50th anniversary civil","story":"\n\nProgressive movements from across Ireland will meet in Derry next

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

employer has reluctantly admitted that it indirectly made money from the RHI scheme \u0026#8211 but insisted that she did not realise that until after RHI closed.\n\n                \nJanet McCollum, who was replaced as chief executive of Moy Park earlier this year, told the RHI Inquiry that although she now accepts that her former company received an “indirect benefit” from the publicly-funded scheme, that has become clear from the public inquiry’s work.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJanet McCollum pictured with DUP ministers Arlene Foster and Lord Morrow\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, Mrs McCollum, who is a trained accountant and was Moy Park’s chief finance officer before being promoted to head the company, said she was ignorant of that fact at the time when the company was reaping that financial reward.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company, which supplies 30% of all UK chicken, had four boilers of its own, but its farmers – to whom Moy Park advertised the scheme – have between them 40% of the boilers on the scheme.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nEarlier evidence to the inquiry from one of those farmers showed how Moy Park’s complex business model meant that the benefits which appeared to be going to farmers ultimately began to accrue to the company itself – with taxpayers’ money indirectly ending up in the bank account of its Brazilian parent company.\n\nIn her written evidence, Mrs McCollum said: “Moy Park has not indirectly earned any RHI scheme tarf income”.\n\nMoy Park is well connected at the top of Stormont, with the inquiry having already revealed that Arlene Foster’s former adviser, Andrew Crawford, tipped the firm off that RHI was to close – leading to it immediately ramping up its attempts to get as many boilers on the scheme as possible.\n\nHowever, under close questioning at the inquiry yesterday Mrs McCollum accepted that the lucrative RHI payments to its farmers not only helped it to rapidly expand its business by funding better heating systems for poultry houses but also helped make up for a shortfall between the fuel allowance which Moy Park was prepared to pay to its farmers and the cost of the fuel which they required to raise chickens.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn June, she told the inquiry that she was never made aware that RHI was financially benefiting the company in an indirect way.\n\nWhen asked  she ought to have been told of that, Mrs McCollum was initially vague in her answer, saying that after reviewing information last year she could see that there was “potentially” an indirect benefit to the company.\n\nEventually, she went on to say: “So, looking at the indirect benefit and the evidence that’s been brought to the inquiry that I’ve seen, I can understand how it might be considered that Moy Park might have benefited indirectly from the RHI scheme from the commercial arrangements that have been long-standing in place with the growers.”\n\nShe went on to say “I can understand how it might be considered that Moy Park might have had an indirect benefit.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe said that no-one in the company ever brought it to her attention that the company was benefiting from RHI.\n\nWhen asked  she was surprised that no one had told her that, she said she believed her staff were trying to ensure that they did meet all the farmers’ fuel costs  – even though not doing so was financially advantageous to the company.\n\nWhen asked the question again, she paused before insisting: “The company did not see at that point in time an indirect benefit.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin then intervened to say: “So you were not surprised?” She said: “No, because the emphasis was on the over-usage, chairman.”\n\nThen, having initially conceded that RHI “might be considered” an indirect benefit to the company, after being pressed she paused before saying: “Yes, it’s an indirect benefit...”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick then pressed her on when she first became aware that benefit. She said: “I first became aware of that through, having left the business, through the inquiry’s evidence that had been brought and the questions that have been asked.”\n\nJanet McCollum repeatedly told the inquiry that Moy Park’s decision to pay its farmers less for heat than she now accepts they needed was out of a desire to discourage wasteful heat, rather than an attempt to increase the company’s profits.\n\nThe former Moy Park chief executive was repeatedly pressed on how she could have been unaware of how the company she headed was profiting from the scheme.\n\nInquiry counsel Donal Lunny put it to the witness: “So you were never aware of that indirect benefit – which you now accept existed – during your time as chief executive. \n\n“To go back, again, to a question I asked earlier, does that now surprise you – that nobody within your organisation had brought that to your attention?”\n\nMrs McCollum replied: “The company and the team, I believe, were trying to do the right thing in a situation where there was a lot of heightened awareness around usage. The focus was on ensuring responsible usage of heat.”\n\nPressed again to answer the question of whether it surprised her she wasn’t told about it, she said: “Well, it would surprise me  the team had seen it as an indirect benefit. \n\n“It wasn’t recognised as an indirect benefit – but I can see how it is an indirect benefit. It wasn’t talked about as an indirect benefit.”\n\nMr Lunny took the former Moy Park boss to documentary evidence which the inquiry has compelled the company to release which shows that it was aware that it was reasonable for farmers to use about double the amount of heat that it was prepared to pay for.\n\nHe put it to her that the RHI benefit to the company must have been “obvious” to it as it calculated how much to pay its farmers for heat.\n\nMrs McCollum did not directly answer the question, which Mr Lunny then asked a second time.\n\n“She again did not directly answer the question, prompting the barrister to ask it a third time.\n\nMrs McCollum eventually said that it had not been obvious to her that RHI was benefiting the company of which she was chief executive until after she had left her role.\n\nUnder questioning from the inquiry’s technical assessor, Janet McCollum agreed that as a business Moy Park would have kept a tight rein on costs and would not have knowingly paid its farmers more than they needed for their expenses.\n\nEnergy expert Keith MacLean put it to her that it was clear that the company was keeping very detailed information so that it set its allowances for farmers at a rate which did not disadvantage it by being overly generous.\n\nHe said that  Moy Park was not able to do those calculations “it sounds quite surprising for an organisation of your size and importance that you’re incapable of doing what the industry from both sides – the consumers and suppliers [of RHI boilers] – seem to have been able to do from a few weeks after the scheme came into force. Are you really describing a deficiency in the ability of your organisation to do those sums?”\n\nMrs McCollum said: “I believe the organisation took the evidence that was available to them at that point in time...on the implementation of the fuel allowance for biomass, we immediately increased it by 50% OK? That’s why I’m saying there was a really signicant increase in the energy allowance. Subsequent to that, the year later, looking at the GB evidence, we brought it up. I believe the dferential in fuel allowance is relatively small.”\n\nDr MacLean said he found it “very hard to understand” how a huge firm like Moy Park would not be able to do the same sums which RHI claimants were doing and thus concluding “there is a benefit here accruing to us because we are paying less than it is costing the farmers – but we’re quite comfortable, morally, to be doing that because we know that they’re making a killing on the subsidy”.\n\nMrs McCollum said: “I understand the perspective you’re taking there and I think it’s all down to the usage element and how the usage relates to what the growers were using and what that gap potentially is.”\n\n*** Next week is set to be the highest profile week of the inquiry thus far, with the entire week taken up with senior DUP figures.\n\nOn Tuesday, leader Arlene Foster will  to testy, particularly in relation to the period in which cost controls were delayed and her then-adviser is alleged to have been working to delay them – something he denies.\n\nOn Wednesday, John Robinson – whose father-in-law is an RHI claimant and who was once the Spad in the department running the scheme but is now the DUP’s chief spin doctor – will testy.\n\nHe will be followed by another ex-DUP Spad, Stephen Brimstone, who is an RHI claimant. And on Friday the inquiry will hear from the DUP’s most senior backroom figure – its chief executive, Timothy Johnston.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n
