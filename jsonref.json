The biggest thing on display is a collage Picasso made in the winter of 1937, of women at their toilet.At its centre squats the photographer and artist Dora Maar (who has just had a good show of her own work at Tate Modern). She is redly gasping, her dark eyes staring as two of Picasso’s other mistresses comb her hair and present a mirror, which seems to show not her reflection but the painter’s.The whole thing is composed of pieces of cut-out wallpaper it is a kind of domestic ‘Guernica’, his anti-war masterpiece that memorialised the bombing of the ancient Basque city during the Spanish Civil War.At the other end of the scale are torn and scratched tiny paper pieces, making knives and forks, dancers, masks and skulls, so small that even pressed between glass they seem to be barely there at all.Then there are his Cubist guitars, made out of small pieces of cloth, string, painted cardboard and newspaper beautiful tricks from scraps. At times, he can seem almost like a children’s entertainer, constantly turning one thing into something else.Towards the end of the show there is a remarkable film of Picasso drawing. He was working with new-fangled American felt pens, which so saturated the paper the coloured marks could be filmed in real time from the other side.The effect is that you see the drawing happening as his hand moves. It’s almost like watching his mind working. I found it entirely mesmerising.Then the show ends, as did Picasso’s life, with deliberately clumsy works full of an old man’s desperate erotic yearning during the swinging 60s, a million miles from the deft, swaggering late 19th century drawing with which it began. Overall, despite the humour, bright colour and occasional sentimental tributes, this is a dark show. Any proper representation of Picasso must be.Because, I suppose, all shows now must try to attract the widest possible audience, including children, there are little jokey notices aimed at the young. But the truth is, children ought to be kept well away from this show in particular and Picasso in general. There is too much grief and anger, too much rape, too much murder.So perhaps it is no great surprise that the mild-mannered British took a while to fall in love with the dark and provocative Spaniard. A famous story has the president of the Royal Academy, Sir Alfred Munnings, leaving the building where this show takes place in 1949, and asking Winston Churchill what he would do if he saw Picasso walking down Piccadilly in front of them.         Girl In A Hat With Her Hands Clasped, 1921. As ever with the good artist, even if you think you know the work from reproductions it’s worth coming to see for yourselfAccording to Munnings, Churchill — who disapproved of Picasso’s non-representional style and left-wing politics — replied: ‘Kick him up the arse, Alf.’ The former prime minister was embarrassed and angry about the anecdote, but it captures a little of the official hostility to Picasso, which lasted long after the Second World War.While Picasso spent the war in Nazi-occupied Paris, he was regularly harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of Guernica. ‘Did you do that?’ the German asked Picasso. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘You did.’ It is thanks to the huge generosity of the Picasso Museum in Paris, which has loaned a large proportion of the best works here, that he gets his own back on Churchill and co now. Indeed, the director of the Musee Picasso has dryly mused that it’s nice to see its London branch finally opening in Piccadilly. Well, Paris’s loss for the next few weeks, is London’s gain. If you are interested in modern art in any way, you simply have to see this show. Give yourself a lot of time and, if necessary, borrow one of the collapsible chairs they offer.It’s grey outside but do make the effort. I can’t imagine there will be a more comprehensive and thoughtful exhibition of this giant of modern art in my lifetime.But do not come here, please, expecting to be soothed. Scornful of his rivals, touchy, promiscuous and blazing with anger about the politics of his time, Pablo Picasso was about as tranquilising as a barbed-wire massage.With magic in his fingers, and a flickering, butterfly mind, art’s ultimate shape-shifter ended up forcing himself to create ‘ugly’ images: because that’s how he found the world he lived in to be.Never fall for sugar-coating, or think great art should be calming. Picasso is better than that.Picasso And Paper is at the Royal Academy, London, until April 13."},{"url":null,"title":"More 35 000 self styled weirdos misfits apply work Downing Street","story":"Share this article Mr Cummings also warned that ministers who fail to get a grip on public procurement will be frowned on as the government tries to drive down waste and free up resources for the PM\u0027s priorities.

According to reports, confirmed by three eminent doctors, a young woman named Mary Toft had given birth to 17 rabbits – or at least the mangled parts of a number of the animals – and was about to deliver more. As news of the births stoked a media frenzy, Toft was taken to London – at the request of George I – and installed in a bagnio while doctors awaited her next delivery. There was no 18th rabbit. After nine days a porter revealed that Toft’s husband had bribed him to smuggle in a rabbit and the whole hoax was uncovered.Toft was arrested and later confessed that her mother-in-law had persuaded her to concoct the story, with the aid of some strategically placed rabbit parts, as a money-making ruse. The doctors who had so enthusiastically testified to the bizarre births were publicly humiliated and the fraud provided journalists, satirists and artists with fertile material for comedy for decades to come.The tale seems, at first hearing, a ribald yet essentially simple case of a peasant woman cocking a snook at a gullible medical profession. But in Karen Harvey’s hands this curious little tale becomes a much more interesting – and bigger – story.The book teases apart archival details of the case to shed light on the social concerns, medical debates, gender relationships and political dynamics of the day. In doing so she gives voice to women like Toft and her circle who are so often silent in history, exploring her physical and emotional state and possible motivations for the hoax. But she also presents Toft’s story in a fresh new, even modern, light: as an attempt by a disempowered section of society to take back control of their lives - and the harsh backlash from the moneyed elite that ensued.Born in 1703, Mary married a cloth worker, Joshua Toft, at 17. Poor, female and illiterate, she left few personal records. She had two children the first died at four months and the second was nearly two when Mary attained national celebrity. Mary eked out the family’s meagre income with farming piecework. In Surrey in the 1720s, the Tofts were living in an area riven by inequalities – Harvey contrasts Mary’s 1d a day wage for weeding with the 12s spent by the Duchess of Richmond on a coat for her pet monkey – and at a time of growing social unrest.As the decline in the local cloth industry wreaked widespread suffering, so the poor were coming under ever increasing control of landowners. New laws extended the list of crimes that were capital offences (poaching was redefined as a hangable crime of theft) and landowners exerted property rights over common ground, including rabbit warrens. Far from being ubiquitous vermin, rabbits were valuable for their meat and fur. In response to their straitened circumstances and lost rights, labourers joined mass protests and trespasses. Just a few months before Toft’s “births”, her husband Joshua was one of 38 men arrested for stealing fish from a landowner’s pond in what was probably an organised trespass. It is therefore plausible, Harvey argues, that Toft’s fixation on rabbits had a symbolic meaning and that her absurd claims can be read as a form of protest, subconsciously or otherwise.Toft testified that her strange births began soon after she chased some rabbits since she had a craving for rabbit meat but could not afford any. She began bleeding and passed “a substance” – this was probably a miscarriage – and some weeks later she delivered the first animal parts. The second episode may have been further signs of her miscarriage or, Harvey suggests, a rare tumour called a teratoma which may contain bones, hair and teeth. It is possible that passing this tumour gave Toft or her mother-in-law Ann Toft, an unlicensed midwife, the idea for the hoax or that the trauma of her miscarriage led her to believe she was truly pregnant with rabbits. Whatever the motive, she subsequently delivered assorted parts of 17 rabbits, including paws, a trunk and parts of a skull, with the help of Ann Toft and a local doctor who excitedly sent news to his London colleagues.Leading medics, including two royal surgeons, were convinced by Toft’s story because it accorded with the prevailing medical theory of “maternal imagination” which suggested that what women saw or imagined in pregnancy could influence their subsequent child. But once Toft’s deception was exposed, retribution was swift. As a poor, powerless woman who had come close to duping the political elite, the medical profession and even the king, Toft was seen as a threat to the social order that must be closed down. She signed a confession and was imprisoned for four months though subsequently released without charge.Her book provides fascinating insights into the social context surrounding the “Rabbit Woman” case while never losing sight of what remains a rattling good story – a potboiler indeed.• The Imposteress Rabbit Breeder is published by Oxford (RRP £16.99).

So what did we learn from the 50th gathering?This was the “global heating Davos”, with session after session devoted to the topic. For Mark Carney, in his last weeks as governor of the Bank of England before stepping down, the story was not the near unanimity among policymakers, but that the financial sector – including the big banks of Wall Street – now understands the investment risk of global heating and is starting to adjust its behaviour accordingly.At the start of the 2019 Davos, Thunberg was a 16-year-old Swedish student going on strike from school to protest against the lack of action on global heating. She electrified last year’s WEF and was even bigger news this time, going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and members of his cabinet, and getting the better of the exchanges. Most seasoned Davos hands thought Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, had blundered when he said he would only start listening to Thunberg when she had a degree in economics.Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.\u0026nbspThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\u0026nbspFor the second time in three years, Trump turned up at the annual festival of globalisation – more visits than Bill Clinton and Barack Obama managed between them in the combined 16 years of their presidencies. The chief executives of the multinationals that flock to Davos find Trump strangely compelling in spite of his anti-globalist views. He was comfortably the biggest draw of the week. There were a few titters as Trump boasted of the economic miracle he has created in the US, but privately American big business likes tax cuts, likes deregulation and would rather have him in the White House than any Democrat.It would be wrong to imagine that UK plc is jumping for joy that Britain is leaving the EU at the end of next week, but there is a sense of relief that much of the uncertainty is over. A year ago, when Theresa May was struggling vainly to get her withdrawal bill through parliament, businesses were putting investment on hold because they were in the dark about how Brexit would unfold. Following last month’s general election, some of the projects that were mothballed have been given the go-ahead. The global economy may also have bottomed out.Along with Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson decided that hobnobbing with people Theresa May once called the citizens of nowhere was not the best political look. At one time it looked as if there would be no UK cabinet minister in Davos, but in the end Sajid Javid was left to fly the flag. There were plenty of ex-ministers around though: the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, the former prime minister Gordon Brown and the former chancellor George Osborne among them. May also did a turn to the citizens of nowhere at a PwC drinks reception.On the first day of Davos, the  broke the story that the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, had apparently been hacked by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Cybersecurity is always on the agenda and there was a personal twist this year, because many of those attending Davos came into contact with Prince Mohammed on the trip when he met Bezos and maybe also exchanged mobile phone numbers with him.  tracked down three of them: Mnuchin the Apple CEO, Tim Cook and the Microsoft boss, Satya Nadella. However, despite their public commitments to openness and transparency, none was prepared to talk about it.There wasn’t an awful lot to laugh about in Davos, what with the backdrop of global heating, cyber-threats, and the coronavirus. But there were the odd moments of levity. Trump provided one of them, albeit unwittingly, with his claim that the US was enjoying a “boom the likes of which the world has never seen”. That would only be true if American history began on the day he was elected president. Javid provided one of the others. Pressing the flesh at a CBI lunch, he was asked by one business leader: “Who are you?” Not realising he was being teased, a visibly taken aback Javid replied: “I’m the chancellor.”Davos says it gets the existential threat of the climate crisis, but does it really? Prince Charles flew to Switzerland by private jet, before switching to an electric car to give the WEF the benefit of his wisdom on how to save the planet. One delegate, kept waiting in the cold while Trump was being whisked from the conference centre to his hotel, tried to count the number of cars in the president’s motorcade and wasn’t quite sure whether there were 37 or 39. The WEF says most attendees arrived by train and that the Zurich group will plant 13,000 trees: one for every one of the bright blue bobble hats it has handed out for free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d43842c51c7d2923e57c1acb41fd8040e77c273e/0_167_5386_3232/master/5386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef206d3587a136af2ff9664200ac29a1","title":"the guardian view on moving the lords northern power house","story":"Relocating the upper chamber to York could be good for Britain – but only if its composition and role are radically rethoughtA news organisation that began life as the Manchester  and whose roots lie firmly in Lancashire can hardly be expected to give an unqualified welcome to the government’s reported plan to move the House of Lords to the city of York. The possibility of such a move is nevertheless a tantalising one for the whole of northern England. If it proves to be more than a passing gimmick, and if it is part of a pluralistic and interlocking attempt to modernise and devolve British government more generally, including to the north, it could also be an extremely desirable one.These are hugely important caveats. At the moment, no one knows what exactly is planned. But Boris Johnson likes big gestures. He finds it easy to commit public money to projects that prove useless. Passengers on London’s New Routemaster buses – one of Mr Johnson’s pet schemes as mayor – will be familiar with that. Billed as a return to the days when one could hop on and off, the rear doors of the buses are now kept shut because, with no bus conductors to sell tickets, too many passengers were dodging fares. It may have seemed a smart idea at the time. But it was a waste of money.Exactly the same could apply to the move to York. In itself, moving the Lords to York would show that the government feels it must respond to complaints that the nations, regions and localities are not being treated fairly in comparison with the capital. But that is all. It would not rebalance the governance of the country. It would not improve democracy in the north of England. It would therefore not solve the problem. The crucial question is whether a move to York is part of a wide and effective reconception of British government as a whole. Unless and until that becomes clearer, relocation of the Lords will be merely an eye-catching idea.The existing ermine-clad assembly comprising a mix of the nation’s upstanding elders and a load of party hacks would in the end be no more use on the banks of the Ouse than it is on those of the Thames. It would have its uses – as the Lords showed this week when they defeated the government on five amendments to the EU withdrawal agreement bill (amendments that were later reversed by the Commons). But it would remain a chamber ruled by patronage. It would still be full of party placemen and women, as the current row about the expected dissolution honours list underlines so discreditably once again.If the composition and purpose of the upper house could be rethought, the move north could be reinvigorating. The four main objections to the House of Lords are that it is unelected, that it is too large, that its members acquire peerages, and that it has an unfocused role in the constitutional scheme of things. If the house could be proportionately elected, reduced in size, separated from the honours system, and based on the nations and regions of the UK, it could become a genuine check against first-past-the-post majoritarian rule by the Commons.Some recent reports claim that Mr Johnson is considering an all-party report from a group convened by Lord Salisbury, which would replace the Lords with a chamber of the nations and regions. This is encouraging as far as it goes. The Salisbury plan – in either of its two versions – would be a genuine step in the right direction. But the proof of these reports will come in the government’s eventual proposals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4446796939adecb7f29e0cde4d61f8d1cf72ead9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8605c87be6fd120e2bb341f2fb6467ee","title":"british politics slowing down good for democracy","story":"After several frenzied, unpredictable years, for the opposition this is a period for patiently building on far-sighted ideasOver the past six years, British politics has become addicted to speed. Our often sleepy country has experienced a rush of events probably without precedent in its postwar history: two pivotal referendums three general elections, two of them called early countless parliamentary dramas and dramatic changes of leadership, poll position and ideology in all the main parties.For activists, commentators, Westminster correspondents, thinktanks with pet ideas and politicians and strategists with big ambitions, this frenzy has been thrilling: new possibilities have seemed constantly to be opening up. Hung parliaments, coalition governments, radical governments of the right or left, the restructuring of the UK and of its relationships with the world – all these rare scenarios have either happened or seemed likely to happen. Our politics, often so narrow and stuck, has seemed fluid, almost without boundaries. Some voters have enjoyed the change of pace. Turnouts at the last three general elections have been higher than in the previous three. Following politics hour by hour, even minute by minute, has become perfectly normal for people who in previous eras barely glanced at parliamentary news.Last month’s election was this manic politics brought to a kind of climax. It was preceded by months of escalating confrontations in the Commons, in the courts and on the streets. It was made possible by overexcited members of three parties: Lib Dems believing they would deliver a historic breakthrough, Scottish Nationalists that it would hasten independence, and Conservatives believing it would “get Brexit done” – the impatience of modern politics encapsulated in three words.But now, with the election over, impatience isn’t the right political approach any more – if it ever was. The Tories look likely to be in power for at least the next five years. Labour and the Lib Dems look likely to be rebuilding for years too. The Scottish independence struggle may have reached a stalemate. And the declared aims of Boris Johnson’s government – reshaping the UK’s relationship with the EU, reviving the north, overhauling Whitehall – are the work of decades, if they are achievable at all. One lesson to take from this abrupt deceleration, and how perplexing it feels, is that during the 2010s politics didn’t change as much, underneath, as those of us caught up in the surface frenzy sometimes thought. Despite the financial crisis, free-market capitalism was not reined in. The Tories ruled almost throughout. And for all the attention given to their digital campaigning in the 2019 election, they arguably won thanks largely to two ancient political forces: the Tory press and English nationalism.Another lesson is that many voters don’t like politics that happens quickly. Change can be frightening – or just a pain to keep up with. Labour’s election campaign, with its daily announcements of brand new, “transformative” policies, asked voters to choose a government that would bring years of rapid change. Not enough welcomed the prospect.How should opponents of the Conservatives adjust to a political era that is going to be slower than they hoped? There may be clues in how Labour recovered from a worse election defeat. In 1931, after a spell in office ruined by a recession and arguments about spending cuts, – just as Gordon Brown’s government was – Labour lost all but 52 seats. Yet over the next decade and a half, the party revived so thoroughly that in 1945 it won its famous landslide.“While the second world war undoubtedly accentuated the advance, it was not the origins of it,” writes Martin Pugh in his history of the party. “The 1930s proved to be a crucial formative phase.” During that decade, Labour elected a leader, Clement Attlee, who was uncharismatic but a good unifier of its factions. It resisted pressure to make its economic approach more centrist. It took control of London’s municipal government and used it as a showcase for radical policies. Despite press hostility, and a BBC much more interested in the Conservatives, Labour steadily grew its support – particularly in the south and among the young, who often suffered most from a sluggish, unbalanced economy and the Tories’ austerity policies.The 1930s were a long time ago, and slow politics was easier to practise then, in a totally different media environment. But the period demonstrates something about the left that some of those inside it, and many outside, often forget: success tends to come from sticking to controversial but far-sighted ideas and patiently building new electoral coalitions around them, rather than from sudden breakthroughs during times of social and economic turbulence.During the 2019 election, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour seemed to forget that his most potent political feature –his moral authority – had been built up over decades. He campaigned in too much of a hurry. His successor is going to have to ignore demands to demonstrate immediate progress. Politics may have settled down, but many voters and journalists remain impatient with it, as Johnson will find out when his honeymoon ends. Even the SNP – electorally secure in ways Labour and the Tories can only dream of – may increasingly struggle to persuade some of its supporters that independence is going to take years more. Politics might also become more measured if the media treated it less like a soap opera, and more like something connected to how Britons are actually living, and how that’s always changing.British politics isn’t going to slow right down. The electoral system creates volatility. There will always be crises some already under way, such as the climate emergency, can’t wait years for governments to attend to them. But unless the UK accepts again that politics sometimes needs to be slow, its political life will be all stalemates and frenzies. Neither is a great environment for democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”.

Perez was in a good mood, saying, “Girl, what’s up? Wanna hang out?” hoping Sciorra was interested in going out that night.Instead, Sciorra told Perez in a serious, whispered voice: “I think something happened to me.” Perez pressed Sciorra further, and Sciorra quietly said: “I think I was raped.”“It was so strange because she whispered it,” Perez said, before whispering into the microphone in demonstration.Though Sciorra is not a complainant in Weinstein’s criminal case now playing out in a courtroom in Manhattan, where two other women with more recent cases are the ones formally attached to the charges of rape and sexual assault against the fallen movie mogul , she was called in as a key witness to his alleged pattern of predatory behavior.On Thursday, Sciorra took the witness stand and gave harrowing testimony on Weinstein’s alleged rape of her in the winter of 1993-94 at her apartment in Manhattan. She re-enacted Weinstein pinning her down on to her bed. “He got on top of me and he raped me,” she said. She said Weinstein then forcibly performed oral sex on her after, telling her: “This is for you.”Recalling the subsequent phone call with Sciorra, Perez recalled on Friday she asked Sciorra if she knew who assaulted her, and encouraged her to call the police. She recalled Sciorra saying, “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t” before hurriedly saying she had to go. Perez said she tried to call Sciorra multiple times that night but Sciorra never picked up the phone.A few days later, when Perez was able to reach Sciorra, she told Perez she was fine and that she did not want to talk about it any further.Several months later, Perez said she got a phone call from Sciorra, who was in London, who eventually said it was Weinstein who assaulted her.During her testimony on Thursday, Sciorra told the jury Weinstein showed up at her hotel room in the middle of the night. Perez recalled Sciorra calling her up and telling her that Weinstein was “harassing her and that she was scared that he was going to get her again”, Perez said.“Then I said, ‘He’s the one that raped you’,” Perez recalled.Once Perez knew the identity of Weinstein, Sciorra gave her more details of the incident. “She was crying and she swore me to never tell anybody,” Perez said. Perez said when she encouraged Sciorra to call the police, Sciorra said: “It’s going to destroy my career.”In cross-examination, Weinstein’s defense team pressed Perez on why she did not take more urgent action when she learned that her friend was assaulted. “I was in a panic, I didn’t know what to do. I was scared, I was scared for her,” Perez said, breathlessly speaking to the jury. “I was in a panic, I kept calling her repeatedly, crying, begging her to pick up the phone.”Weinstein, 67, has denied all the charges.Earlier in the day, a forensic psychiatrist testified as an expert witness, dispelling common “rape myths” and explaining common behavior of sexual assault victims to the trial’s jury.As a powerpoint presentation titled “rape myths” was pulled up in front of the jury, Barbara Ziv, a psychiatrist based in Philadelphia walked the jury through six common myths she said people have about rape victims. Ziv was invited to testify by the trial’s prosecution and said she was not informed of the case’s facts before her testimony. She has testified in more than 200 cases, including in the trial of Bill Cosby in 2018.“One of the reasons why I’m allowed to testify in this court … about sexual trauma and victim behavior is because people come to assess sexual assault with preconceived notions that are usually wrong,” Ziv told the jury.“This idea that women respond to sexual assault verbally, by screaming, yelling, hitting, punching, biting – although that happens, it’s rare,” Ziv said.Another myth, she said, contradicts Weinstein’s argument that the sexual relationship he had with the women represented in the trial was consensual because they maintained contact with him after the alleged assaults.Earlier this week, Weinstein’s lawyers showed the jury a series of emails and texts from the women that suggested they continued to have warm relations with him. One message showed a woman reminiscing with Weinstein about earlier encounters and asking him if he could meet her in London.Ziv explained the psychological complexity of sexual assault – which, Ziv noted, is the most unreported crime – often stems from a victim’s inability to process trauma and a tendency to blame themselves for the assault. She noted that for many victims hiding the assault is preferred to the perceived consequences of reporting.“Most iniduals think: ‘I can put it behind me, I can put it in a box. I don’t want it to get worse,’” Ziv said. But, ultimately, she said: “They can’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a58c8d3d2a93ed4fc244ea77a44b3af9acf1b1f/25_0_1032_619/master/1032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03eff5835108610e203132bd6e58d929","title":"zola review taylour paige janicza bravo","story":"Fantastic performances, including breakout Taylour Paige, and confident direction from Janicza Bravo lift an often bumpy rideThe story of Zola seduced the attention of the internet back in 2015 not only because of its high quotient of narrative left turns and lurid details, but because it showed the hitherto unseen power of Twitter as a tool for compelling longform storytelling. In the space of about 148 tweets, Detroit waitress Aziah “Zola” Wells spun a staggering tale of a trip to Florida that went horribly wrong with conviction and wit sparking the interest of Hollywood with an impassioned battle for rights. Initially James Franco won out but the production was shelved after accusations of sexual misconduct and the following year, the indie director Janicza Bravo came onboard, a development that seems all the more like kismet given both the subject matter and the importance of a woman of colour being given the reins.It’s a tale that seemed too juicy to be true and after some digging at the time, it was discovered to be partly a fabrication, something both the real Zola and the film admit to, a knowing play to an audience willing to suspend disbelief in order to be entertained with a far-fetched string of events. But the basis of the story remains true even if some of the names have been changed. Zola (Taylour Paige) meets Stefani (Riley Keough) while serving her at a restaurant and the two hit it off. When Stefani invites her on a road trip to Florida, with the express purpose of making considerable money dancing, she jumps at the chance. Arriving to pick her up isn’t just Stefani but her awkward boyfriend Derrek (Nicholas Braun, AKA Cousin Greg from Succession) and a mysterious unnamed friend (Colman Domingo). There’s a sense of adventure in the early stages of the journey but as they get closer, Zola starts to question exactly who she’s travelling with and as the night gets underway, she finds herself trapped in a dangerous game of prostitution, pimps and murder.What keeps us glued during the first act isn’t just Zola’s sensationalist story but Bravo’s unexpected directorial choices. There’s inevitable grit but she chooses magical over social realism, framing the story like a fucked up fairy tale complete with a dreamy Mica Levi score, punctuated by the sounds of Twitter. The script, co-written by Bravo and Slave Play playwright Jeremy O’Harris, also retains the humour of the original thread, again framing an increasingly dark story with a light touch. There’s a wholly different way to make Zola, as a harrowing cautionary tale, but the pair rightfully decide to tell it for the most part with a wink.It would have also been too easy to rely on gaudy aesthetics to accompany Zola’s descent but instead Bravo has enlisted cinematographer Ari Wegner, known for her stark work on Lady Macbeth and the second season of The Girlfriend Experience and there’s a delicate push and pull from them both as they successfully capture a seedy underworld yet sustain a distinctive artfulness. Bravo is an accomplished hand and her stylistic choices, which often come right out of left field, avoid gimmickry for the most part. It’s a bold calling card even if the script isn’t always quite as confident, because at a swift 90 minutes, the film has some pacing issues.There’s an unstructured messiness to the plotting which I initially liked, sticking true to reality or at least the heightened reality that Zola created for us in her original thread, and for the first half we’re locked in – but near the final act, attention drifts. It’s not exactly the wild ride some might expect (and some on Twitter have been claiming with Uncut Gems and Spring Breakers not proving to be entirely fitting comparisons) with Bravo choosing to contrast the story’s eccentricities with a sometimes mundane look at the lives on show. There’s not a great deal of plot to fill the time and instead as the film moves along, it’s both her eye-grabbing direction and her actors that sustain our interest.Keough has developed a knack for inhabiting chilly characters with an unknown nature, in last year’s Sundance horror The Lodge as well as the first season of The Girlfriend Experience, but here she opts for the opposite, loudly presenting herself as a cocksure stripper-cum-prostitute with an uncomfortably affected accent, speaking in a specifically problematic way that irks Paige in one standout car scene. It’s Paige’s turn as Zola, an appalled observer, that’s the real star-maker here. She’s not only a fantastic dancer (with a background in ballet and as a regular on VH1’s cheerleading drama Hit the Floor) but she’s also a deftly understated comic performer. Her abrupt one-line reactions to the unravelling drama around her are pitched exquisitely but it’s her wordless facial responses that derive so much of the film’s humour. One hopes this launches her into an even higher bracket and with an upcoming role alongside Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, it seems like she’s already, deservedly on her way there.The Twitter-to-screen adaptation of Zola is as scrappy and imperfect as the original story but just as likable. There’s something unusually compelling about what Bravo does with the material that makes up for its missteps. It’s a bumpy ride but definitely one worth taking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbedfd2bf2291ccd3ab8fe859cbb3dc10e4dac41/0_218_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc89e5aa20dbc329247d779babcb7fc5","title":"teenagers campaign for traffic light labels on food packaging","story":"Group calls for warnings to be displayed on items high in fat, salt and sugar to tackle obesityA fledgling campaign group led by teenagers is calling for traffic light-style front of pack labelling to be made mandatory in the UK.The Bite Back 2030 campaign said progress on improving child health was stalling and that the move would bring the UK in line with other countries. These include Israel, which this week announced new laws making warning labels compulsory on packaged products high in fat, salt and sugar. Elsewhere, Canada also plans to introduce mandatory warning labels, while Chile introduced them in 2016.In October, the public health minister, Jo Churchill, publicly committed to launching a review into labelling in the UK early this year.Bite Back 2030 was set up in 2019 to create an “unstoppable movement” of young people to campaign for healthier eating. Its aim is to half childhood obesity by 2030. It was co-founded by chef Jamie Oliver, who has criticised the way junk food is advertised.The organisation has a youth board consisting of 12 teenage activists, who are lobbying food companies and the government to improve access to healthy food. It is also urging young influencers to send out more positive messages about healthy eating to their millions of social media followers.As well as Oliver, its ambassadors include model David Gandy, comedian Romesh Ranganathan, Love Island star Dr Alex George and experts from medical, nutritional and campaigning backgrounds.Bite Back 2030’s youth chair, 16-year-old Christina Adane from south London, said: “Labelling should be there to help us – not make it harder to know what’s healthy for us and what’s not.“We want honest, simple and helpful labelling like the traffic light system out there on everything. And if food companies won’t do it voluntarily, we want the government to step up and step in. The UK should be leading by example, not falling behind.”In the UK, younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer. It is estimated about one in five children aged 10 to 11 years old are obese, with a third of children aged between two and 15 overweight or obese."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a358e61e0501a4cb88c1b58a13fa64fa399ff527/0_349_5175_3107/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eff25f8ac734da116f33aad7f4dc8bab","title":"manchester united manchester city women","story":"Mary Earps is fired up for the third Manchester derby of the season, this time in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday. “We just want to beat them and take them out of the game,” the United goalkeeper says of Manchester City, with a grin. “The reality is they are great players but we have a great team too and we are more than capable of winning this game.”“I assure you that if it goes to penalties the Barmy Army will be behind my goal,” she adds. “They will move if they have to.“When you are playing at home you want a loud atmosphere and that is where we are getting to in the women’s game now. In prior seasons it didn’t really feel different if you were home or away. But I think the noisier and more fiery it is, the more fun it is.“I buzz off it personally and I think it is intimidating for the opposition to come to. I don’t want to say the more hostile the better but the louder the better because it really gives you a buzz on the pitch and gets you through tough moments.”With a bigger profile and more fans comes the need for a much thicker skin. “You always play your best football on the sofa,” the 26-year-old Earps says. “I’m the same. I watch a game and: ‘Why did this person do this?’“Lots of people have opinions now, the game is growing and there are more people on social media, more media in general and you have to have a thick skin to deal with every man and a dog telling you how to save the ball in that moment. I can assure you that in every situation I’m very much trying.”In women’s football it has been harder for goalkeepers because whereas the game has grown, goalkeeping coaching has lagged behind. It is finally catching up, though.“There are more trained coaches now,” Earps says. “I didn’t have a goalkeeper coach full-time until I was 18 or 19, which now sounds completely ludicrous. It can still improve but it is so much better. I would train two, three, four times a week. In Sunday League my dad would just throw the ball to me, or one of the players would warm me up before a game, which seems completely ridiculous.”Instead goalkeepers were left to do their own research and Earps turns goalkeeper encyclopedia when asked who she admires. “I’ve watched so many. Manuel Neuer, Ter Stegen, Joe Hart, Casillas, Reina, Hope Solo, Alisson, Ederson, Buffon. So, so many, all with completely different strengths.“When I was growing up I loved the shot-stopping of Joe Hart, the way Casillas dealt with one-v-one battles, and Pepe Reina’s side-volley was insane. Manuel Neuer all-round. Now it is probably Ter Stegen.”If her heroes were mostly men, Earps is now part of a generation providing role models for the next layer of aspiring keepers. “Before I spoke to just young girls. Now I see a lot of young boys saying: ‘I’m a goalkeeper.’ I always like speaking to them as I think it is the best position and most important,” she says.“I like having that interaction with the kids because it’s not easy: it is split-second decision-making it is heavily criticised. Especially as a kid that can be intimidating. Your peers are saying: ‘Why didn’t you save that?’ and you are trying.“I don’t think social media helps that when it broadcasts good or bad things that goalkeepers do. Eight-year-old kids feel they have to live up to a standard of Buffon, who is 41 and nobody knows how he’s still going. Maybe it is more open about the struggles of the position but I’m always encouraging of people wanting to be a goalkeeper because it is a wicked position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/192ab0c646b567f32a3551288213b9a0430a9ddf/0_21_3615_2170/master/3615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b05870c04eec3a16940f8d10b0a8683","title":"paulo dybala juventus mask manchester united tottenham","story":"The Juventus No 10 discusses his Polish heritage, nearly giving up on football and interest from Tottenham and Manchester UnitedBehind the mask is a boy. Just before Christmas 2016, Paulo Dybala missed Juventus’s last penalty in the Italian Super Cup final against Milan. It was still on his mind days later when, watching Gladiator, he had an idea. From that moment, he has celebrated every goal by putting his hand across his face, thumb and index finger extended to imitate a mask. It has been seen often – there have been 64 goals since, starting with a penalty in the next match – instantly identified as his. It is also, he says, “not just a celebration but a message”.Juventus’s No 10 speaks softly he is thoughtful and the mask is worn lightly but listening it becomes apparent it goes beyond celebration to become more meaningful, if subconsciously. He says it was inspired by the penalty and the film, that he “didn’t really think about” it as protection or some emotional shield. But in the way he explains it – in everything he says the morning after its latest outing – it is revealed as deeper.At the end of a long conversation comes the inevitable question, if only for a laugh. Which, by the way, it gets. So, about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo again … “I’m the only player who shares a dressing room with both and people only see the tip of the iceberg, not the work beneath they haven’t won all they’ve won because they’ve been lucky,” he says. “And, yeah, I know people have to ask but they must know what I’m going to say.”Go on then, who’s better? Dybala makes a play of looking out of the window at the Alps. “I can’t answer that,” he says, laughing.He answers everything else with an honesty and openness that surprises at times, his responses considered, calm. He talks about global warming – “we have to change this is the only place we’ve got to live” – about books (he is reading Allan and Barbara Pease on body language) and about exposure – “we’re humans: there are 10 positive comments and the one that gets to you is the negative one, but you can’t focus on that.” He talks about football, which means talking about life too themes crystallise around the mask, as if it expresses his experiences.“A lot of the time, you have difficult moments and you have to go out there and fight anyway: not just in football, in life,” he says. “Bad things happen, to me or anyone, difficult times in life, but you have to keep going: put the mask on like gladiators do, and fight. Every battle. That was the idea I tried to transmit. People liked it, understood it. And that’s pleasing because the messages you send aren’t always interpreted the way you’d like.”Which seems a good place to start any article, a rider usefully attached to every interview. Another good place might be Laguna Larga, population 7,437: Paulo’s Town, as a billboard there proudly declares over a picture of him “wearing” the mask. Or Poland, perhaps. After all, although Dybala has never been to Krasniow, he will because, as he puts it, “I’d like to see where it all began”.Krasniow is a village of 49 inhabitants where Dybala’s paternal grandfather Boleslaw lived. During the second world war he was sent to a Nazi labour camp. Afterwards, there was little left and he departed for Argentina, sleeping in cornfields. He had almost died before someone found him. Boleslaw did not talk about the past much. Dybala wants to know more.“I’d like to go, although there’s no family left,” he says. “It’s a tiny place, eight or nine houses. Some Polish journalists put me in touch with my grandfather’s daughter but she passed away. There are cousins in Canada and we’ve spoken but not met. I want to. I tried to get a Polish passport but we couldn’t find some of my grandfather’s documents and we got Italian passports from my mother’s side instead. One day, I will. I feel maybe more Polish than Italian. Personality-wise, my dad was more Polish my middle brother, exactly the same. All of us, a bit. Maybe a bit colder, Polish blood. Italians tend to be more emotional.”Dybala’s grandfather died when Paulo was four. His father, Adolfo, died when Paulo was 15. A football fan, Adolfo drove his son to Córdoba every day, a 70-mile round trip, to train with the second ision side Instituto until, at 14, Dybala went permanently, living in the home of Faustino and Orlando and their grandchildren. But when Adolfo developed a tumour, Paulo asked to return to Laguna Larga. “I was young and it was very hard. My mother suffered a lot, my brothers too. You see the pain but you continue. I’m not the first to go through that and won’t be the last. Sadly, that’s the circle of life. Now we have someone helping us from above.There were tears but it had been his father’s dream, too, which drove him on. Dybala, a football fan even now who says if there is a second ision game in Scotland on TV, it’s on in his home, became the youngest ever goalscorer at Instituto, breaking Mario Kempes’s record, aged 17. He scored 17 in his first season. In April 2012, Palermo came calling, which must have been daunting. “Actually, I was completely convinced,” he says, although the move was not of his making, an early lesson in football’s other side, and nor did it start well, his debut season in Europe ending in relegation.His registration rights had been sold to an investment fund, which was why Palermo was the only option. “Things eventually came to light. There are still some people with legal issues in Argentina. Football has become a huge business. We’re on the inside but a lot of the time you can’t do anything. I was very young.“But I was very happy. From the second ision to Serie A was an enormous change but I was convinced. My family came and the adventure began in Palermo. The first year didn’t go well. It was all new and in truth it was a difficult dressing room an older squad which was difficult when things went badly. We were struggling, results were bad. I was a kid, seeing a lot of things. Now I’m grateful because the experience became a lesson. Here, at Juventus, you ‘always win’, right? Everything’s nice. It was the opposite there but the second season was great. We won the second ision and personally it was good.”... And you’re cheap. Dybala smiles: “I don’t want to imagine the pressure players have now. That helped in a way: I started to relax then, saw that I couldn’t focus on that.”It had all happened fast. He left home at 14, returned at 15 and left again at 16. At 17, he made his debut. At 18, he went to Italy. At 19, he was relegated and at 20 promoted again. At 21, he joined Juventus. The national team, too, although becoming a fixture remains elusive, Dybala admitting that what he has done until now “has not been enough”, his club form not always reproduced, a place alongside Messi difficult to find.And then, suddenly, almost without noticing, he’s 26. “It’s mad. Not long ago someone said: ‘You’re five off 200 Juventus games’, my fifth season and I thought: ‘But I only got here yesterday.’ If everything goes well I’ve got 10 years left but it went so fast.” Four leagues, three cups, a Champions League final: success normalised, almost unremarkable.Then, last season something shifted. Dybala might not have reached this fifth season in Turin. No longer an obvious fit, he scored 10, five in the league – half as many as his least productive season until then – and in the summer Manchester United and Tottenham bid. Juventus welcomed their approaches. “I was close to leaving,” he says. “That was in the club’s thinking, I knew. Until the last minute, we were waiting.”In the end Dybala stayed but he speaks enthusiastically about England, a place of “packed stadiums” and “passion”, where open spaces would suit him, inviting suggestions he would welcome the opportunity arising again. “I have two years left on my contract. That’s not a short time but it’s not a long one either. We’ll see what plans Juventus have, if they think I might leave in the next market or if they want me to stay. That’s a decision for the club to make. It’s hard to know because things change in a second.The night before this interview, Dybala had 97. “And most of those are in the opposition’s half, which means less space but more opportunities to play,” he says. “Sarri’s idea helps players a lot – all players. One, two touches. Combine. Move the ball fast. Defensively, it’s mechanised, there’s no freedom there. But with the ball, close to goal, a thousandth of a second to think, it’s improvised – although I know my teammates, their movements, the movements we’ve worked on during the week.“When I started at Instituto in Córdoba, my coach had the same ideas, so I come with those mechanisms built-in. Latin Americans have that ‘fútbol de potrero’ idea, street football.”Players like Dybala. “As you get older and football becomes more serious, professional, you understand that parts of your game are left behind. Sometimes you encounter coaches that give you freedom. For forwards that’s the best thing that can happen and I still try to play as I always did, with the ball.“We should never forget that this is a game too and that when we were little, we played for fun. That’s how we started and who we are. We all have a kid inside of us and we should never leave him behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

There’s just one obvious catchJust as you never forget how to ride a bike, so you never forget how to do a downward dog but what goes clean out of your head, after even a brief period of absence, is why you would ever want to. Even a week off yoga more or less guarantees a massive effort to rejoin the flow. So two things would help: if you could do it at home, so that it ate only half an hour out of your day, rather than two. And if it didn’t cost anything.Which is what brought me back to the internet: Adriene is the most famous practitioner here and also the freest, both in the sense that the tutorials don’t cost anything, and that they are incredibly easy to find and navigate. They are a bite-sized length (24 minutes) and are arranged in blocks of 30 each series starts easy and builds up. I’ve tried Adriene before, and couldn’t stick to her. That was before I realised the point of yoga by doing the 90-minute, hot-studio variety. A large part of the value is in being bored: “feel the boredom and do it anyway” was my mantra for a while. That enforced concentration on activities that are fundamentally unengaging – holding a warrior two, then doing something pretty similar and calling it warrior three – is mysteriously good for the mood (I’m avoiding the word “soul”, for no good reason).So, I came back to Adriene’s videos with a renewed self-discipline and found them far easier to stick to, getting a bargain-hunter’s thrill from not spending 20 quid on a class, and allowing her sun-kissed American tone to wash over me, without feeling as if I was exercising to an Instagram advert. She’s very good, very clear, quite fast-paced. There is enough plank action, even at the start, that you can certainly feel the benefit afterwards. Yes, you are still in your living room, easily distracted by the postman or stains on your carpet, but if you can’t let go of domesticity for the length of a single episode of The Big Bang Theory, arguably the answer to that is to do even more yoga.Frankly, Adriene is such a pro that the only comparable alternatives I found were subscription sites, but they’re not insanely expensive. Ashleigh Sergeant is extremely fun to watch – ambitious, show-offy yoga that makes you want a body more like a sports car. A lot of the moves I couldn’t really emulate, however, so this was more entertainment experience than exercise, and frankly, it wasn’t that entertaining. Cat Meffan is as well organised and accessible as Adriene, and has a reassuring studio that looks and sounds as if she could be recording next door to you, which is good if you are prone to feelings of wannabe Californian fraudulence.The only pitfall is obvious there’s nobody around to tell you if you’re doing it wrong. So you really have to concentrate, which can make it feel as exhausting as a class three times as long.If you can do it in front of a mirror – I couldn’t, unless I practised in the bath – that would be so much better than waiting until it’s dark and trying to check your shapes in a window."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bbc7fd1fe7a8ac15dd1a5dba25dcfc0ec76b449/459_32_5218_3131/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bcaf4425a01b8e1289443c18a574d3","title":"tim dowling skipping rope arrives post beast my goals","story":"‘Do you want to see me cross over?’ I shout above the whipsaw buzz of the ropeDuring the first half of my working day, I am generally able to leave my office shed for a break in a warm, silent kitchen, where I can drink coffee and stare back out the window at my empty desk with a certain satisfaction. In the afternoons, however, with the winter sun already dipping behind the roofline, the kitchen becomes a hive of inactivity. Whenever I go in, two or more of my sons are to be found hunched over laptops at the kitchen table. Charging cords are stretched across the room at knee height. To the untrained eye, the kitchen looks like a place of business, specifically the kind of tech startup where you’re allowed to turn up for work at three, in bare feet.“Hey,” I say, pulling the back door shut.“What’s good?” the youngest one says.“All right?” the oldest one says. Nobody looks up. I approach the coffee area, which looks as if it has been trashed by a disgruntled ex-employee on his way out the door.“There’s no milk,” the oldest says.“I bought milk this morning,” I say.“Well, it’s gone,” the youngest says.“There should be no ‘gone’,” I say. “There should be you, going out to get some more.”“You could get some more,” the oldest says.“I’m busy,” I say.“He’s a businessman,” the youngest says, with icy scorn. The middle one walks in and opens the fridge.“I am a businessman,” I say.“No milk?” the middle one says.I sigh heavily, and then put on my coat and march down to the shops. It’s dark by the time I return with the milk. I find a slim package, addressed to me, sitting on the mat.“Couldn’t any of you be bothered to answer the front door?” I say, waving the package.“I didn’t hear anything,” the youngest says. “Did you hear anything?”“Nope,” the oldest one says.“Me, neither,” the middle one says, lifting the milk from my grasp.“Don’t sport with me,” I say, ripping open the package. Inside the envelope is a felt pouch with a snap clasp and writing on one side, black against matte grey.“What’s that?” the youngest one says.“What does it say?” I ask, holding the pouch up to his nose. He squints and retracts his chin.“Beast Your Goals,” he says.“Correct,” I say.“What does that even mean?” the oldest one says.“It means this,” I say, sliding the contents of the pouch on to the kitchen table. There is a short silence.“A skipping rope,” the middle one says.“The most expensive speed rope you can buy,” I say. “The Elite.”“How much is the most expensive skipping rope?” the oldest says.“Who cares?” I say. “I’m worth it.”Although the real answer is: not that much. The rope comes with an Allen key built in to each handle and complicated instructions for adjusting the length.“It is kind of cool,” the middle one says. “For a skipping rope.”“Stand back,” I say, unfurling the rope. “My goals aren’t going to beast themselves.”“Do you even know how to do this?” the youngest says.“I certainly do,” I say. “It’s one of my things.”I find a spot at the far end of the kitchen, under the skylight, which affords just enough clearance to swing the rope. I take four or five gentle jumps and then speed up.“Not bad,” the oldest one says.“I can go way faster when I’m in practice,” I say. I do not add what I am thinking, which is: this hurts. My wife walks in.“What is your father doing?” she says.“He’s beasting his goals,” the oldest says.“Do you want to see me cross over?” I shout above the whipsaw buzz of the rope.“No, thanks,” the youngest says.I do it anyway, alternating crossed arms between each jump. On the third revolution, the rope clips the youngest one’s outstretched toe.“Ow!” he screams.“Feel the quality?” I say, stopping to catch my breath.“Would he not like to beast his goals outside?” my wife says.“Outside?” I say. “With a rope like this? Are you crazy?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcbc2a740152c3b3bad7d0c27c8f0f78ad4ecd12/56_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42490e6eead8711726b84cb5bdf5a5e8","title":"a giant what other countries make of the bbc and how their media compare","story":"As the BBC reels from the departure of its boss and renewed pressure over its funding model, what are the views of the corporation from abroad?The BBC is widely admired in France and frequently cited by politicians as a model of public service broadcasting. News of its director general’s early departure was reported with concern.Le Monde said Tony Hall’s announcement came at an awkward time: the BBC was losing viewers to Netflix and other commercial streaming services, under attack “from all sides” for its Brexit coverage and had heard the prime minister publicly question the continued existence of its licence fee.“The corporation’s central role in British life is being eroded,” the paper said. “It is becoming harder to defending a licence fee paid by all. Of course, the BBC remains a giant. Some phenomenal successes still bring the nation together. But Hall’s successor must prepare for a serious fight.”France’s public TV and radio are being reformed to create what Emmanuel Macron in his 2017 election campaign called “une BBC à la française” – essentially, bundling all the country’s public TV and radio stations into one group in search of professional synergies and financial savings.Italians generally see the BBC as a model to be imitated, but it is a judgment based on reputation rather than on any real knowledge of British TV programmes. Italy has one of the lowest levels of English-language fluency in Europe and while some BBC programmes are visible on Italian satellite televisions, they are watched by only a small part of the population.The Italian equivalent of the BBC is the broadcaster Rai, which is owned by the finance ministry. In the years after the second world war, RAI’s early programming was influenced by the Reithian values of the BBC and its educational approach. It aired travel programmes for people who could not afford to travel abroad and it proposed the BBC model of an independent public broadcaster for itself.However, Rai has often been at the centre of controversies over its political independence owing to its proximity to the government. Most recently, in 2018, the coalition government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and far-right League oversaw the appointment of a Eurosceptic journalist known for anti-gay, anti-immigration, anti-vaccine and pro-Russia views as Rai’s president.Marcello Foa remains in the role despite the fall of the government in August last year, and this week one of Rai’s most popular political shows, Porta a Porta, sparked criticism after giving the League leader, Matteo Salvini, a solo slot during the half-time break in a Juventus-Roma Italian Cup football match for him to pitch to voters why they should back his party in key regional elections in Emilia Romagna on Sunday. Lorenzo TondoMost Americans who know the BBC know it through its shows, consumed via BBC America or according to what Netflix and Amazon buy in. Costume dramas are forever huge, The Great British Bake-Off inspires serious coverage, and devotees of Veep can quote Malcolm Tucker verbatim.But most will not be aware of rising concern in Britain over the fate of the BBC itself. The notion of a powerful state broadcaster – anguish about Fox News under Donald Trump aside – remains distinctly alien.There is a BBC equivalent in the US. Not C-Span, a nonprofit that provides barebones politics coverage, but the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, established under Lyndon Johnson in 1967, together serving the young, the less well-off and liberals, most of them ageing, on the coasts and in college towns between.Programming – think Sesame Street or Ken Burns on Vietnam – is authoritative, rigorous and vital. PBS and NPR score highly in surveys about public trust. But they do sometimes find themselves under fire and usually it’s because of money. PBS and NPR rely on donations as well as federal cash but during the 2012 election, for example, Mitt Romney said he would stop PBS’s subsidy. “I like PBS,” the Republican said. “I love Big Bird … but I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.”Romney lost the White House race to Barack Obama, his threat to a beloved PBS character a big yellow albatross around his neck. Such threats – from Trump too – prompt reliable outcry. But funding remains inadequate and in 2015 even Sesame Street decamped, to be made by HBO. Martin PengellyAustralians are well aware they adopted the public broadcasting model of the BBC to form the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a much-loved institution that plays a vital role in the political and cultural life of the nation.ABC viewers still enjoy BBC productions such as Call the Midwife and Doctor Who, but over the years the BBC content from the UK has shifted to the commercial broadcasters due to rising costs and shrinking budgets.Formed in 1932 with the launch of a single radio service, the ABC is now a multi-platform media operation with television, radio, digital, international and emergency broadcasting functions, that latter of which has received overwhelming praise during the recent bushfire emergency.The ABC charter is set down by parliament and requires the corporation to provide informative, entertaining and educational services that reflect the breadth of the nation. What that encompasses is frequently disputed, especially by the Murdoch press.Australians have not one but two publicly funded broadcasters. A multicultural broadcaster, SBS, has only one-tenth of the ABC’s budget and has been allowed to receive some revenue from limited advertising since 2005.The difference between the BBC and the ABC is in the funding model. Since 1989, the ABC has been wholly funded by a three-year budget commitment known as the triennial funding system. This cycle has provided $3.16bn.However, the ABC has been historically subjected to budget cuts, mainly from conservative governments, and it is trying to manage cuts of $84m over three years imposed by the Coalition.The ABC serves a population one-third the size of the UK and does it with a budget one-eighth that of the BBC. Amanda MeadeThe longstanding editor-in-chief of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, likes to compare her channel to the BBC, suggesting that the BBC’s global mission is to project British soft power, while her own channel naturally boosts the Kremlin’s line. When RT was censured by Ofcom for impartiality violations, the Russian government announced similar checks on the BBC.There is a tiny kernel of truth in this comparison: in 2015, a government defence review boosted funding to the BBC’s Russian operations as part of an overarching plan “to promote our values and interests”. But the “soft power” mission of the BBC is very different to the blunt use of Russia Today and other Russian state outlets, which are obliged to follow the Kremlin line on issues such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. Whatever problems the BBC may have, any neutral observer who spends time comparing the two outlets will see how disingenuous the comparison is.The BBC’s well-staffed Russian-language service is one of a few remaining large-scale independent news outlets in Russia, which often irritates the authorities. This week, when a BBC Russian reporter asked the speaker of Russia’s Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, a tricky question about whether planned constitutional changes were democratic, Volodin responded with a semi-coherent monologue in which he repeatedly mentioned that the reporter was working for a foreign state.

Formerly £80,000 to £100,000My decision to become a father was quite gradual. I am 48 now and as a gay man of that generation, you never think you can become a parent. Then you see that other people like me have done it and you think maybe it is an option after all.Working in family law, I did a few parental order cases and met people – straight and gay – who have become parents through surrogacy, so I decided to take the same journey. I thought, however, I would do it with a partner who wanted the same thing. But that didn’t happen and I was getting older. I didn’t want to still be working in my 70s to pay for my child to go through university, so I chose to go it alone and become a single dad.Once I had made the decision to get started, I was mentally prepared to go ahead with it no matter the costs. I initially wanted to do it in Canada but, like the UK (where commercial surrogacy is illegal), there are very few surrogates. I eventually chose to do it in California. I went through an agency, which matched me with a surrogate, and I found an egg donor. She became pregnant through IVF and then in 2016 – a year after I started the whole process – I was a dad.All in, including travel, healthcare, agency and surrogate fees, it cost $200,000 (£153,000). It was a lot more than the initial estimate quoted by the agency, but I was very excited and I still am very happy with the decision. As far as midlife crisis purchases go, this is the best one! Becoming a father is life-changing.It turned out to be a huge financial risk though. I am a German citizen who lived and worked in London for 27 years. I also have a British passport and before deciding to become a parent I was self-employed, running my own family law firm.I used to have an office with staff and a turnover of six figures. Yes, in a good year I could put money aside after paying the overheads (up to £100,000) and tax, but in a bad year it got quite tight. I lived frugally, and that’s how I saved enough. I am not someone who buys labels, eats at The Ivy, does drugs or whatever else people spend their money on.But having children in London can be very expensive. My local nursery charged about £2,000 a month for five days a week. Yes, kids are eligible for free hours after they turn three, but not all nurseries are signed up to the scheme. I therefore hired an au pair. She cost £85 a week, including board and lodging, and it was just good to have a second adult around to talk to. That kept me sane.Despite closing the office to cut costs and working from home, I was still only breaking even. Over the past four years I have effectively earned nothing and have been living on savings. That’s why I decided to stop working completely and move to Berlin in August 2019.One of the big advantages of living in Germany is the low cost of childcare. Kindergarten is free from one until they start primary school at six. It makes a huge difference. The housing costs are probably not far behind the UK. I’m paying €2,000 (£1,700) a month for a three-bed flat on the outskirts of the city.However, not everything is more affordable. Over-the-counter drugs are incredibly expensive. In England, you can buy your paracetamol in the supermarket for 25p a packet. But here you have to go to a pharmacy and they will only sell you branded ones for about €6.50. Entertaining my child is also more costly here. Whereas in London most museums are free, in Berlin I have to pay at least €10 for a ticket.There’s no NHS in Germany, so everyone has insurance – the cost of which comes out of your salary and is dependent on your earnings. But it’s very complicated and the price varies from person to person. If you are unintentionally unemployed, the job centre pays for it. I am in a position where I am neither, so have to find a job pretty soon so I can slot in to that system. In the meantime I have private insurance and I still have enough savings to support us.Whatever happens next, I will never begrudge giving up my job to have a child. People who have children when they are in their 20s or 30s sometimes feel they missed out on their career and desperately want to go back to it, but I feel I have done everything I wanted to do as a lawyer. I did it to the max. I’ve started a new chapter in my life.As told to Matthew Jenkin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11d0bbc1a22be2a60902d686eda06636b22db0fb/34_1806_4633_2779/master/4633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86526df39e1ec6d590a7c97f91b1f06b","title":"la roux my label dropped me on new years day i was like yippee","story":"Five years after going it alone, Elly Jackson is back with a sophisticated third album – via panic attacks, scrapped songs and life advice from Joanna LumleyThis is part of my stage set from Glastonbury 2010,” says Elly Jackson, AKA La Roux, pointing at an 8ft gold- and silver-plated palm tree. “I got lights fitted in it so it’s a lamp, too,” she continues, her bright orange sweater clashing perfectly with the oversized ornament. But we are not standing in some vast storage space picking out old tour props we are in her living room in south London, where the palm tree now takes pride of place behind her TV. Even her cat Calypso eyes it up strangely as she settles on the sofa between us. Jackson had to fight to get her bold centrepiece, haggling with the hire company who kept telling her no. “They said: ‘We don’t sell stuff,’ and I was like: ‘I get that, I’m not stupid, but I will give you anything for it.’”Fighting to get what she wants has been the overarching theme of Jackson’s tumultuous career so far, and that tenacity forms the foundation of her new album, the supple, groove-led Supervision, the first on her own label. It is still unmistakably La Roux, kaleidoscopic musical references covering her favourite 80s pop from Let’s Dance to Faith, but it also feels looser, a reflection of an artist more comfortable in their own skin. While the album itself carries a sophisticated ease (its eight tracks clock in at a luxuriant 48 minutes), it was preceded by a nightmare of scrapped songs, panic attacks and life-changing decisions.When she arrived with a bang in 2009, all burnt orange Mr Whippy quiff and ear-pricking falsetto, Jackson stood out in a sea of TV talent-show blandness. Her success was sudden and unexpected: second single In for the Kill’s metallic 80s electropop peaked at No 2 in the UK and was later remixed by Kanye West for its US release, while the follow-up Bulletproof landed her and La Roux’s silent second member Ben Langmaid their first UK No 1. The accompanying self-titled debut album topped 2m sales and won them a Grammy for best electronicdance album. Just like La Roux’s music was a throwback to a different time, Jackson kept it similarly old school with the press, favouring sweary honesty over media-trained politeness. “I just wanted to get rid of all the crap you weren’t supposed to say in interviews,” the 31-year-old laughs, ruffling her loose, David-Bowie-circa-Low fringe.As early as 2010, however, the wheels started to come off shows were cancelled and crippling anxiety meant Jackson lost her voice suddenly. “I found success really, really hard,” she sighs. “It made me want to run for the hills. It wasn’t cool to be that popular.” The sessions for album two were torturous, costing her label hundreds of thousands of pounds in redundant studio time, and she and Langmaid eventually parted ways. However, the end product, 2014’s excellent, Chic-indebted Trouble in Paradise, gave Jackson her second UK Top 10 album. Still, given that five-year wait between albums one and two, there were inevitable tensions with her major-label bosses. Jackson rattles off a list of issues: a lack of communication, a lack of respect, and a lack of a video for the album’s big single Uptight Downtown (“A massive fuck-up”). On New Year’s Day 2015, a letter from the head of Polydor landed on her doormat, unceremoniously announcing that she was to be dropped. “I opened it and was like: ‘Yippee, I’m fucking free!’” she smiles. “I knew how lucky I was to get out of that deal” – she still owed the label three more albums – “but everything was a mess. I had no infrastructure whatsoever and I knew I was going to have to start from scratch.”Reader, she did not heed those words. While her new record Supervision was eventually knocked out in four months towards the end of 2018, demoed downstairs in Jackson’s makeshift kitchen studio, and finished with producer Dan Carey (Kylie, Sia, Kate Tempest), it was preceded by an earlier attempt that was marred by destructive old habits. In contrast to her usual openness, Jackson won’t go into details about the early iteration of album three, refusing to name its main collaborator.Things came to a head at the end of 2017 during a holiday in Greece with her then partner of 10 years. “I was walking to the beach and I kind of just collapsed out of nowhere,” she says, slowly turning her body to the side, her head resting on her fist like a Rodin sculpture. “I was holding on to the floor trying to breathe and I said: ‘I don’t think I’ve ever been this unhappy.’ I felt like I needed to walk away from everything in that moment, which then made me have another panic attack.” She sits bolt upright and loudly admonishes herself, rattling through a list of questions she couldn’t find the answers to. “It was like: ‘How much longer do you fucking need? What is wrong with you? All you have to do is make fucking music, it’s not that complicated. Why are you so stressed? Where’s your confidence gone? Where did your voice go? And why is this still happening now, when you’re on holiday?’” That last one makes her laugh, as does the memory of telling her mum, Trudie Goodwin, AKA The Bill’s Sergeant June Ackland, she was scrapping a near-completed album. “She was like: ‘I’m going to have a heart attack and die because of you,’” she says, her south London accent growing more pronounced. “Imagine being me! But I knew I had to stop doing things that made me unhappy.”Once the decision was made, everything changed. “I think that whole process made me see other things more clearly,” she says. She ended her relationship. “I was a mess. I felt unfair about the person I was being, like it wasn’t right to be with anyone else at that point.” She channels this clarity into the aptly titled Supervision, be it playfully poking fun at ideas around control on the disco-tinged lead single International Woman of Leisure or directly digging into the split on Automatic Driver’s loping funk. Not that Jackson consciously planned it that way, with the song’s prescient lyrics, including “sometimes I feel like we’re just pretending”, eked out of garbled melodies she had left on the demo.Besides, sex is not hugely important to her. “Maybe it’s because I make music instead of having sex,” she shrugs. “I like playing with the feeling and sounds of being sexy and maybe that’s my outlet. And I’m not asexual, either, before anyone starts,” she adds. “If men had any patience in bed they could possibly be of use, but they don’t.” She lets out a palm tree-rattling cackle, before becoming serious again just as quickly. “I just found there was a lot of pushiness around labelling myself. Over time, I’ve understood myself a lot better and now I can be happier with my sexuality. At the moment I don’t feel like I even have a sexuality because I’m not aiming it at anything or anyone. Male, female or otherwise.”Jackson is acutely aware that, as in 2009, she is still a glorious anomaly. Her recent appearance on Jools’ Annual Hootenanny was a case in point. Sandwiched between the likes of Tom Walker and Stereophonics, Jackson – resplendent in shiny pink bomber jacket and what looked like MC Hammer’s old trousers – seemed like an extravagantly dressed alien. “It’s quite a shock to people now,” she says of standing out. “All the more reason for me to do it.” She laments the end of the era when pop stars could be both otherworldly entertainers and perfectionist musicians. “Now, you’re either PJ Harvey or you’re Dua Lipa,” she says. “As we get further down that line, I find having my own lane in pop music harder and harder.”But that is a worry for another time for now Jackson is just happy her strongest relationship remains intact. “I realised music was about enjoyment,” she smiles. “It’s not meant to be about having a hit, or making money, or keeping your label happy, or any of that dirty bollocks. It’s about making me happy. That’s why I do it.” Supervision is out on 7 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

It was from a friend sending a link to a breaking news story of allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The claims from several women against the film producer were eerily familiar to an incident that Brock alleges happened to her. This week, Weinstein goes on trial charged with rape and sexual assault. But for dozens of women with claims against him, their only recourse is to civil courts. Brock tells Anushka Asthana that while she is part of the class action suit against Weinstein, she is deeply unhappy with the terms of the proposed settlement, which she believes would allow him to accept no blame for the allegations.

His mother, who had come to the UK from Tanzania and worked in a factory in Huddersfield before moving to the capital, was friends with many of the plant’s mostly female east African Asian employees.The Grunwick dispute – which saw its participants dubbed “strikers in saris” by the media – lasted two years, with 550 arrests. “The back of the house overlooked the picket line, so there was no question of whether or not to support the strike. It was literally on our doorstep,” said Desai, who is now a London assembly member for the city and east constituency.Desai, who became a Labour councillor in Newham in 1998, described the dispute as marking the beginning of his political awakening. He remembers the miners travelling from Yorkshire to join the picket line and support the striking women – two parts of the Labour movement coming together in their shared interests. “They are such iconic images,” he said. “Asian women, very short in stature, with all these Yorkshire miners. There were hundreds of people there.”In the wake of Labour’s crushing election defeat, the apparatus that supported that alliance appears to be hanging by a thread. In the postmortem that followed the loss of seats across the so-called “red wall” of de-industrialised areas in the north of England and the Midlands that had voted Labour for generations, one idea has gained traction: that the party has lost touch with its “traditional base” of white working-class voters by pandering to the metropolitan elite. In that conversation, many fear, another part of Labour’s “traditional base” – the working-class black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) voters living in seats that are every bit as much a part of Labour’s “heartland” as the red wall – has been forgotten.“The question is, what are Labour heartlands?” said Rohit Dasgupta, an academic and Labour councillor in Newham in east London. “Is it just places like Bury and Hartlepool, or is it also places like inner London boroughs, like Newham and Hackney? These are also Labour heartlands. Lots of Labour’s core vote comes from here, and there are sizeable BAME communities who vote Labour. I think it feels almost like some people within the party take the BAME vote for granted.”Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director at the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, argues that in their desperation to find a way to win back the red wall, some in the party risk falling for a rightwing narrative that pitches white and BAME communities against each other. “The right have put forward the argument that the reason white working-class people are being neglected is because advantages and privileges and focus and attention have gone on ethnic minorities,” she said.“But that’s not the case. All working-class interests, white and BAME, have been neglected by politicians. In fact research has shown that ethnic minorities have lost out from austerity policies much more, in the same way that women have lost out more in comparison to men. The economic problems of white working-class groups in the north are not due to migrants or to black and ethnic minority people one group has not lost out at the expense of the other,” she said. “It’s not a zero-sum game.”The debates surrounding the Labour leadership race have so far focused on the question of which candidate would be best placed to win back support from white working-class communities, with many arguing that the next leader should be a northerner. Pundits responded to the rumour that the Tottenham MP David Lammy could run for leader by suggesting he would not be the best person to reconnect with the party’s “patriotic heartlands”. In all of this, some activists have argued, Labour risks repeating the mistake it made with those “red wall” seats with the places that now form its last stronghold.Researchers from Class conducted focus groups with nearly 80 people in London and found “significant overlap in everyday lived experiences” of white working-class and minority ethnic or migrant working-class people. The four main themes were a feeling of a lack of power and a voice concern over the precariousness of their living conditions experience of class and race prejudice and a resentment at the loss of community space.While Will Jennings at the Centre for Towns thinktank is clear that Labour’s loss of support in certain white working-class communities is a problem the party needs to address if it is ever to achieve power again, he said that did not mean it should disregard other parts of its coalition.“We haven’t seen yet the data from the British election study, so we can’t be absolutely sure how people voted, but we do know that Labour’s vote tends to do better in areas with more ethnic minorities,” he said. “You can’t get around the fact that Labour has seen its vote fall most sharply in areas that were leave voting and, by composition, had fewer ethnic minorities.“Labour should be concerned about why it lost support in those places and the feelings of economic distress felt in those places – people being discontented with politics and concerned by social change – but that doesn’t mean that it should disregard other parts of its electoral coalition.”Many of them also live in the constituencies that are at the heart of the discussion. “The erasure of ethnic minorities in the north and Midlands is quite astonishing,” said Haque. “In many constituencies you wouldn’t have got that Brexit vote if it wasn’t for ethnic minorities also voting Brexit.“They talk about a select number of areas like the Bolsovers and the Sedgefields and the Bishop Aucklands, but they’re not talking about the Oldhams, the Bradford Easts, the Stoke-on-Trents. They have a substantial number of ethnic minorities, but they just get erased. People just talk about the white working-class Brexit voter.”Desai said he often thinks about an experience his mother had two days into her job working in a factory in Huddersfield. “It was the first time she had seen snow and she had a bad fall. The largely white female workforce came running out to help. They made her a hot drink and clubbed together to get a taxi for her to go home, saying they would explain to management what had happened.“There was quite a lot of racism in west Yorkshire at the time, but that showed the commonality of the working class. My mother still remembers that incident to this day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38493fb130b1aa2bdc798014dbe1f5ad61dd4034/0_1421_7262_4358/master/7262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1ab46c146351720b20358f729ddc742","title":"renowned chef refused residency after living in uk for 23 years","story":"Claude Bosi said the Home Office’s response showed the government’s ‘inhumanity’A two Michelin-starred chef who has been in the UK for 23 years says he now feels “unwelcome” after his application to remain in the country after Brexit was refused.French-born Claude Bosi, 47, who runs Bibendum restaurant in London, said the system was “inhuman” and made him feel like leaving the country.He received a letter from the Home Office saying his application was refused after mistakenly seeking permanent residency and not the special route open to EU citizens only – the EU settlement scheme.“I laughed when I opened the letter. I couldn’t believe it. But I feel sad, I really love Britain. I love this country, I like the way they give you a chance to succeed. But this is, forgive my language, a kick in the balls. I have been here for 23 years, I pay tax, I pay VAT, I employ 60 people, but this is saying ‘sorry, tough, we do not want you’.”He said he had never heard of the settled status scheme which was launched last March.“I applied for permanent residency because a friend recommended it. He has a French wife and he said she got it no problem so that’s what I did.”The chef, who held two Michelin stars at his restaurant Hibiscus in London before taking over Bibendum, shared part of the letter from the Home Office with his 27,000 followers on Instagram“They have my records, they could see I was French. If this was the wrong thing to do somebody should tell me. Nobody told me I should apply for settled status, even when I went to the Home Office in person to get my photo taken.“You have people there who can’t answer questions. When I asked how long it would take, what was next, they couldn’t answer. You are made feel unwelcome.“After 23 years you feel like you are being taken for granted and they take your tax and then the robot just says ‘no’,” Bosi said. “This is the inhumanity of the government.”He has lived in the UK since 1997 and has two children with another on the way.He said if he had received the letter two years ago, before he invested his money in Bibendum, he would probably have left the country.His letter told him that he had not “provided adequate evidence to show that you have been a qualified person” to remain and could reapply providing five years worth of P60 tax records, rather than the one P60 that he had supplied.It also gives the impression that the settled status application process has yet to be launched, telling him at the end of what appears to be a templated letter that “a new scheme for EU citizens” will be “announced in due course”.One legal expert said it was a failure of communication by the government and more must be done to raise awareness under the Brexit withdrawal agreement about to be ratified.“They should have at least updated their letter to those applying for permanent residence to make them aware of the settled status scheme,” said Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex.“There is an obligation under the withdrawal agreement to publicise the citizens’ rights rules and this seems to be an obvious failure, if people are still misunderstanding this.”The Home Office launched the settled status scheme last March after huge controversy over EU citizens being threatened with removal after applying for permanent residency.The scheme was designed to be easy and simple and so far the department appears to have had major success with 2.7m applications in less than a year.A Home Office spokesperson said the chef had “made an application for a permanent residence card – something which EU citizens living in the UK are not required or encouraged to do. His application for permanent residence was not successful because he did not provide sufficient evidence to show he met the criteria.”They added: “We have spoken to him to help him to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, which has already guaranteed the rights of over 2.5 million people. It’s free, there is plenty of support available online, on the phone or in person and EU citizens and their families have until 30 June 2021 to apply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youAccording to the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, four people in Scotland are being tested for coronavirus after returning from Wuhan.Speaking to the ’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, Prof Jürgen Haas said: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students.

Chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, it was called to ensure appropriate measures were in place to deal with the virus if it does spread to Britain. However Whitty said that the threat of the virus entering the UK has not been totally eradicated as medics were still waiting for the results of checks on several other people.Samples of between 10 and 20 other suspected carriers of the virus are being analysed, the  understands.On Friday night the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three instances of the virus. All had visited China.UK government officials are systematically working through every passenger who has arrived from Wuhan over the past 14 days – the incubation period for the virus – and checking up on their health.The complex task involves cooperation between airlines, the Department of Health and the Border Force: and the most recent arrivals will be checked first.While the government emphasised that the risk to the public was limited Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said it was still “early days” in the course of the virus, and that it is “highly likely” that cases would be seen in the UK.But he stressed that most of those affected abroad are making a good recovery. In an earlier interview with the Today programme, Cosford said that contingency plans were ready should cases be detected.“I think it’s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one,” he said.Some public health experts privately fear that the public is at risk of becoming unduly worried about the virus and believe that the government or PHE should take steps to provide reassurance.There is also concern that some media outlets are exaggerating the risk posed by Chinese students.From Saturday the Department of Health and Social Care will publish figures every day for the number of suspected cases across the UK. But if a positive case is identified, the chief medical officer of whichever of the four home nations it emerges in will make that announcement.The Scottish government confirmed later on Friday afternoon that results for two of the five patients in Scotland tested for Coronavirus have come back negative, while it was understood that another patient was tested at Belfast’s Royal Victoria hospital.Two of those tested in Scotland had been diagnosed with flu after travelling to Wuhan in China – the origin of the global outbreak. Downing Street said four out of five suspected cases in Scotland were believed to involve Chinese nationals. Late on Friday the official death toll in China rose to 41 with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.A crucial question for how the outbreak will unfold is how contagious the virus is. Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out.An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University, puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February.The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China.In the UK universities began taking measures to stop the spread of the virus warning students considering travelling home to China to celebrate Chinese new year that they risk being quarantined on their return. Medical experts also remained at every UK airport with information on the virus being given to passengers returning from China.Elsewhere, private schools were also gearing with contingency plans for overseas pupils who were unable or unwilling to return home for upcoming holidays. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country.While there is “no immediate cause for concern” the situation needs to be closely monitored, independent school groups said, adding that schools should “err on the side of caution” to minimise risks to staff and students.This came as a British grandmother, Veronica Theobald, told how she was trapped in Wuhan and had been unable to return home.The 81-year-old from Lancaster, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had not been able to go outside for more than a week for fear of falling ill.Her grandson, Kharn Lambert, who has lived in the city for five years, said she was due to fly back to the UK on Monday. However, her return was cancelled after the city was placed on lockdown.Lambert, a PE teacher, said: “There is no knowing how long she will have to stay here.“I do worry if I have to go out for whatever reason that I will bring something back into the house and she will become infected and fall ill.“My family at home are extremely concerned about her, but I’m trying hard to reassure them that I am taking the best care of her as I can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

It was the same whenever a new reporter came into the Manchester crown courtroom and stared into the dock. Sitting there, smiling, between three hulking security guards, was a small man with thick-rimmed hipster glasses, playing with the shiny, shoulder-length hair he had not cut since his arrest in June 2017. Him? That’s Britain’s worst rapist? Predators come in all shapes and sizes, but Sinaga’s “worst ever” billing was hard to square with the boyish figure in the lumberjack shirt, scribbling notes behind the bulletproof glass as a stream of nervous young men went into the witness box to testify against him. was present at three out of Sinaga’s four trials, and Sinaga often seemed to be enjoying himself. He would cock his head to one side, as if studying a nature documentary, as he watched videos of himself raping dozens of men who had made the mistake of going back to his flat after a drunken night out. The prosecution tried to persuade the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, that Sinaga didn’t need to see the films he had recorded on two iPhones, one perched on a dresser for long shots and another handheld for closeups. But Goddard reluctantly ruled that he should be allowed to see the evidence in order to mount what seemed to be a hopeless defence: that he wasn’t a sexual predator, but a harmless deviant. He just happened to be irresistible to young, usually straight men, who would pretend to be asleep as part of a sexual fantasy in which Sinaga would penetrate them on camera, sometimes for hours on end.There was no remorse. Were we in the presence of a psychopath? By the time the 36-year-old gave evidence in his fourth and final trial, before Christmas, he seemed to have persuaded himself that he was innocent. It was a “50 Shades Of Grey” thing, he said the sort of sex people have “underground”.When Sinaga first stood trial in May 2018, charged with drugging and raping 12 men, no journalist knew Greater Manchester police were trying to keep it quiet. They had already gathered enough evidence to suggest that Sinaga might have abused 195 men between 2005 and 2017, including before he even arrived in the UK on a student visa from Indonesia in 2007. More trials were inevitable. They had identified about 120 of the victims and 48 were eventually willing to testify, far too many for one jury to cope with. On one level, the jurors’ task was simple: they just had to decide whether the men in the videos were awake. But to do that, they had to watch hours and hours of explicit footage, much of it so traumatising that they were offered counselling once their trials were over.Sitting on the press benches, journalists could hear but not see the videos: snoring and sleep-talking, with occasional sirens.  got wind of the second trial in April last year, and attended the third and fourth in September and December. Reporting restrictions banned all media coverage to avoid prejudicing future juries, and we were barred from telling friends what we had seen and heard. It was hard in a case that felt very close to home. The locations where Sinaga preyed on his targets were horribly familiar, outside Manchester clubs where we’d had our own drunken nights out: Factory, Fifth Avenue, the Ritz, Gorilla. Crown court cases often seem distant when you’re a reporter: gang violence, domestic dramas, stupid decisions you feel quite sure you would never make yourself. But what happened to Sinaga’s victims could have happened to anyone who had been out and had too much to drink who had lost their phones and mates. If Reynhard Sinaga had invited you back to his flat, you might well calculate you’d be able to tackle him if he tried anything silly. He was only 5ft 7in. And anyway: he doesn’t look the type. Right?Some of Sinaga’s victims gave evidence in open court, shunning the offer of screens. They seemed to want to get a good look at him. Many said they didn’t remember meeting him, even when police knocked on their door several years later. They were adamant that detectives were barking up the wrong tree, until they were shown stills from the videos. The investigation team arranged to visit them at home with crisis counsellors from Saint Mary’s sexual assault referral centre. A police officer would begin by telling the men why they were there, and counsellors would start the therapy that continues today with 60 of Sinaga’s victims.“There were many different reactions but a lot of men felt completely overwhelmed,” says Lisa Waters, the centre’s deputy directorate manager. “Some were very distressed. Some were very confused. Some were very angry and wondered why we’d come and told them this, which you can understand.” Not one of the victims wanted to see the films, but some were glad to get back watches and phones they hadn’t seen since a drunken night out many moons ago Sinaga had stolen them, along with passports and bank cards, as souvenirs. A couple of men immediately went online and deleted him as a Facebook friend. They were horrified to realise the friendly man who had added them after they had woken up in his flat in a pile of vomit (“He said he saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory,” said one man, giving evidence via videolink) had in fact drugged and abused them.In court, the contrast between Sinaga and his victims – tall, stocky, laddish, all but four heterosexual – was striking. Most were students, but there was also a chef, a personal trainer and two members of the armed forces. The youngest were 18, the oldest 36. One was still in sixth form.Though the trials delivered powerful justice for all 48 men, many questions remained unanswered. How had Sinaga kept his double life a secret from all his friends and lovers? When did he begin his campaign of rape? And had the police missed opportunities to catch him earlier?When reporting restrictions were finally lifted earlier this month, Sinaga’s friends told us they could not believe the man they knew as “Rey” was capable of such wickedness. Even his most recent boyfriend, whom we tracked down to a hotel in mainland Europe, struggles to reconcile the predator with the man he was in a relationship with for six months in 2013. George (not his real name) first met Sinaga through a mutual friend over drinks at Sinaga’s flat. “He was kind, always joyful,” George recalls. The pair spent hours at coffee shops, talking about everything from childhood to politics, “from the simplest to the most complicated” topics. George says Sinaga went for straight-looking guys – “I know he liked the ‘hetero’ type and the first time we met he thought I was hetero” – but adds that their sex life was normal: there was no role-play around pretending to be asleep, although Sinaga did like to wake him up by initiating intercourse. “I am confused, puzzled,” George says, during a break from work. “I would never imagine him raping somebody. It is so unlike the Rey I knew.”News of the case came as less of a surprise to his former flatmate, Andrew (not his real name). We first contacted him in May last year, during the second trial, but he wasn’t ready to talk. He changed his mind on 6 January this year, after Sinaga was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 30 years. Whereas Sinaga’s friends all talk about the giggly party animal who was obsessed with Victoria Beckham and the Spice Girls, who recounted every sexual encounter like it was a fairytale or a Hollywood film, Andrew knew Sinaga had a predatory side.From September 2013 until early 2015, Andrew lived in the spare room of Sinaga’s flat in Montana House, a modern block on Princess Street in central Manchester. Andrew is now 27, but he was 21 when he moved in, and worked at G-A-Y, one of the biggest clubs on Canal Street, the heart of Manchester’s gay village. He paid £400 a month for the box room, sandwiched between the open-plan kitchen and living room, and Sinaga’s large master bedroom. The flat was in a great location, five minutes’ walk from G-A-Y and a 10-minute stroll from Manchester University’s main campus, where Sinaga completed his first master’s after arriving in the UK on a student visa in 2007. For Sinaga, the flat had another significant advantage, being on the same street as two nightclubs, Factory – in a building that once housed Joy Division’s record label – and Fifth Avenue. On a busy night, the Factory queue snaked right under the flat’s window. Across the street, he could see drunk students eating kebabs in the bus shelter. If he had his windows open, he could hear them remonstrating with the bouncers who wouldn’t let them back in.Andrew moved in after his sister, a longterm friend of Sinaga’s, moved out. But the two men ended up on such bad terms that Sinaga called 999 to ask police for help to evict him in February 2015. Sinaga was advised that it was a civil matter. The police had no evidence then that their time was being wasted by a serial rapist.Sinaga was hard to live with, Andrew remembers. He hogged the bathroom and spent hours in front of the mirror on his great obsession: his highlighted hair, which he maintained with industrial quantities of hairspray. Andrew was not allowed in Sinaga’s bedroom but would sometimes slip in when he was out, usually to borrow hairspray. “The rest of the flat was quite nice but it was disgusting in there,” he recalls. Sinaga had a double bed, but on the floor there always seemed to be a makeshift bed cobbled together from two grubby duvets.Sinaga’s narcissism soon began to grate. His PhD thesis said it all, Andrew says. Entitled “Sexuality And Everyday Transnationalism Among South Asian Gay And Bisexual Men In Manchester”, it was basically an autobiography: “He was doing a PhD on himself.” Leeds University failed the thesis in 2016. According to Andrew’s sister, Sinaga seemed convinced that the world would end without him. “I had an argument with him once, because he believed that if he died, all life would cease to exist,” she says. “I tried to explain that we would all still be here. He didn’t get it.”A few months after moving in, Andrew noticed something odd: Sinaga kept leaving the flat in the middle of the night and coming back a short time later with different men. “I just thought, OK, he’s out to meet a guy: a Grindr hook-up or something,” Andrew says. “Some of the places on Canal Street stay open until 9am, so it’s not that he didn’t have anywhere to go. It just started to seem unusual when it became so frequent.” He kept shtum: “I had a boyfriend who I would bring back to the flat as well, so I wasn’t going to say anything about him bringing people home. I consider myself to be a very unprying person. I didn’t really question it, and I suppose I didn’t really want to know either.”Then, walking home from G-A-Y one night, Andrew saw Sinaga hanging around outside Factory. Another time he was outside Fifth Avenue. As he recalls the encounters, he shakes his head, unable to comprehend how he failed to understand what he saw.“He was standing there on his own. That was unusual. That’s when I started to think he was taking advantage, even though I didn’t make the connection I should have. But I thought: fair enough, he goes for drunk guys – maybe he’s got low self-esteem. I could tell he had only just left the flat. He’s a very well-dressed person but he was standing there in sweat pants, flip-flops and a jumper, as if he had literally just left in his pyjamas.”Pepe (also not his real name) first met Sinaga around 2009, in the Bannatyne gym in Manchester’s gay village. He was in a WhatsApp group with Sinaga where he would discuss his conquests. Some of their messages, from July 2015, were read to the court, with Sinaga announcing that his latest flatmate was going to move out in August and he would be living alone. “You can get in lots of straight boys, darling,” Pepe replied. Sinaga responded with a picture of a 21-year-old he had raped eight times the previous evening, having met the younger man drunkenly trying to walk six miles home to Stockport after losing his bank card. “Hahahahaha,” Pepe wrote. “There’s always a new one.” Earlier, on New Year’s Day 2015, Sinaga had boasted of sleeping with another straight man he had met in Factory, saying he had begun the year with his “breakthrough to the gay world”. He sent some pictures he said he had taken “secretly” that morning. “I always wonder how you manage to get these straight boys,” Pepe mused. “Lol dunno,” replied Sinaga. “Good luck mostly lol. Plus it’s Manchester hun. There’s always a chance here.” But Pepe, who fell out with Sinaga shortly after this exchange, insists he had no idea any of the men had been raped. And he says he never believed his friend was “turning” straight men in a sinister way: “When we say ‘straight’ guys, many people aren’t comfortable with themselves as being gay, so they call themselves straight.” Pepe says he never slept with Sinaga but remembers a detective asking what role Sinaga took in bed. “I said he was the bottom, in gay slang… Many times he mentioned to us, ‘Oh my God, I went home with a guy last night and my bum is still burning.’”Despite being “out” in Manchester, Sinaga was in the closet with his parents, Pepe remembers. Every time he went back to Indonesia, he had his hair cut shorter before he got on the plane. “They knew he was different somehow but he never told his family about his sexuality, that’s for sure,” Pepe says. “He shared with us a couple of times before going home that he was nervous. His father would give him a hard time. Once, he mentioned that he wanted him to meet this girl in London, the daughter of some important person from his country. He would send us messages when he was in Indonesia saying his family were horrible and they wanted him to get married.”George, the ex-boyfriend, says Sinaga had a poor relationship with his father, a palm oil tycoon: “He told me a few times how he was glad that England gave him the opportunity of living in a country where he didn’t need to pretend to be someone else.” Yet Sinaga presented two very different faces in his adopted home. Andrew first got a sense of his dark side in 2014, when one day he heard a knock on the door. “I didn’t think Rey was in, so I answered it,” Andrew says. “There was this guy there, he must have been 18 to 21, and he looked surprised to see me. He said, ‘Oh, sorry, does a Chinese guy live here?’ I said, ‘Yeah – Rey?’ and he said, ‘Yeah – is he in?’ I said, ‘I don’t think so.’ The guy looked really uncomfortable and he said, ‘It’s just that I was here last night’ – or the other night. He said, ‘I woke up here’ and he used the word rape: ‘I just want to know if I was raped or not.’ And at that point I thought: fuck.”Andrew gave the man Sinaga’s number and shut the door. Almost immediately, he heard ringing from Sinaga’s room. “Rey came through to the living room a few minutes later, laughing, saying: ‘Did you give my number to a boy?’” Andrew remembers the visitor being tall, gym-toned, tanned, with short hair. He was nervous and stuttered slightly. “That’s when I started to worry what was going on.” But he didn’t ask any questions: “I suppose I didn’t want to know.” He also didn’t want to be homeless. “I had nowhere else to go.”  Not long afterwards, Sinaga brought home another man in his mid-20s, late at night. A fight broke out shortly after they went into Sinaga’s bedroom. “I came out of my room and saw this guy stripped down to his boxers with, like, one sock on or something. And he’s got Rey up against his bedroom door with his hand on his throat. They were shouting at each other,” Andrew recalls. “I then spent about an hour calming this guy down, getting him dressed slowly, and out of my flat, and walking him down to the front door, just trying to reassure him… I can’t remember what he was saying to me because he was very drunk and wasn’t really making a lot of sense. I think he thought Rey had tried to touch him, and he didn’t really know why he was there.”While many of the victims had no memory of meeting Sinaga, and no clue they had been abused – because, the jury was told, of the “relaxing” effect of GHB, the date rape drug he was suspected of using – others stayed in touch. One 19-year-old, who met Sinaga after a night out on Canal Street with his mum, texted with him the following day, unaware that Sinaga had raped him six times the previous evening. He’d woken up at 10am, naked and confused, and Sinaga said he’d undressed him because he’d been sick. He gave the young man clean clothes to wear – a pink T-shirt with the word “love” on it and some jogging bottoms – and the two started drinking again. Sinaga then asked him for sex and he refused, saying he had a girlfriend.That afternoon he sent Sinaga an SMS: “Yo man haha literally just got home I’m so pissed we will have to meet up tomorrow Night if your up for it.” Sinaga was enthusiastic about the idea: “Looking forward to another good old drunken night. Bring us the shots till we pass out. Ha!” But the boy got cold feet when Sinaga steered the conversation back towards sex.In 15 months living with Sinaga, Andrew says he saw no evidence of drug-taking in the flat. He knew from the gay scene what paraphernalia came with taking GHB, and never saw any of it: no pipettes, no syringes, none of the little fish-shaped soy sauce bottles you get with sushi sets that are just the right size for measuring out a dose. “He just drank alcohol, and not even that much,” Andrew says.Listening to the evidence, it was hard not to wonder why the victims did not realise what had happened to them. Perhaps it was the complacency that comes with being a young, straight man. “I thought briefly he might have done something, but I thought: stuff like that doesn’t happen,” one 21-year-old told the jury. Had dozens of young women woken up in Sinaga’s flat with no underwear on, and no memory of the night before, would they have been more likely to suspect the worst and go to the police?Only two of the men Sinaga attacked were sufficiently worried after waking up to seek medical assistance. One, a 33-year-old, called police and also contacted Saint Mary’s sexual assault referral centre in Manchester city centre, on 25 April 2017. “I just wanted to report a, like, possible sexual assault thing,” he told a 999 operator, explaining that he had woken up with a sore anus in what he thought was a hotel room, with an Asian man next to him being “overly friendly… just like cuddling me, stroking me”. He thought he might have been at the Ibis hotel, across the road from Montana House, the address on his Uber receipt.Forensic analysis identified a stranger’s semen in the man’s boxer shorts, but there was no match on the DNA database, and the police investigation focused on the hotel and went nowhere. Sinaga was unknown to police as a perpetrator, though he had reported crimes, Andrew says. Once, towards the end of their flat-share, Andrew was on his PlayStation in the living room when Sinaga brought home another stranger. “The door opened and I turned to see this giant, terrifying-looking man. He was clearly on drugs – his eyes were massively dilated – and he looked scary, thuggish, as tall as the door.”Sinaga took the man into his bedroom, smiling. Within a minute, a fight had started. Sinaga and Andrew managed to get the man out into the communal corridor, where he started smashing things up, barging into a neighbour’s unlocked flat. Sinaga called 999, and the police arrived and took the man away. They asked Sinaga if he wanted to press charges, but he declined. What on earth was he doing with a violent drug dealer who was known to carry knives, they asked. “You’re very lucky that neither of you has been killed,” the police officer said.In the early hours of 2 June 2017, Sinaga was almost killed by the last young man he brought back to Montana House. The boy, an 18-year-old rugby player, had lost his friends in Factory. Sinaga, then 34, suggested he come back to his flat and try to contact them from there. And that’s as much as the boy could remember until he woke up several hours later, lying face down, with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He was in a bathroom and Sinaga, naked, was sexually assaulting him.In the ensuing fight, Sinaga bit the boy, who responded with such powerful punches that by the time the paramedics arrived, Sinaga had to be taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain. Police initially arrested the wrong man, suspecting the 18-year-old of grievous bodily harm. That changed when they succeeded in unlocking Sinaga’s phones. Though police believe Sinaga has been abusing men since 2005, the earliest victim to go to court was the man he met on New Year’s Day 2015.The Sinaga story is unlikely to end there. At least 30 new potential victims have approached the police since he was sentenced, with detectives promising to fully investigate every new case they uncover. The CPS has left open the possibility of future trials, and Andrew now feels ready to go to court and testify for any of the men he met while he was Sinaga’s flatmate – particularly the one who knocked on the door the morning after, asking if he might have been raped. “I really hope he gets in touch with the police. I really want to help,” Andrew says.Only Sinaga knows how many men ended up comatose and abused in his city centre flat, or why he did it. From his prison cell at Strangeways, he has refused for two and a half years to cooperate with probation officers, detectives or psychologists. According to his mother, he still maintains his innocence. He will be 66 when he is first eligible for release – or even older, following the attorney general’s referral of his sentence to the court of appeal. Perhaps, when the enormity of that dawns on him, he may feel willing to tell all about his horrifying campaign. • Anyone with information about this case can contact GMP on 101.

Given Specsavers are the main sponsor of Test match cricket in England, the vice-captain’s response was not really on brand.Stokes later released a statement, saying: “I wish to apologise for my language that was heard on the live broadcast today after my dismissal. I should not have reacted in that way.“As I was leaving the playing area, I was subjected to repeated abuse from the crowd. I admit my reaction was unprofessional and I sincerely apologise for the language I used, especially to the many young fans watching the live telecast around the world.”Depending on how the match referee, Andy Pycroft, interprets the incident, Stokes could be charged with the level three offence of “threat of assault on another player, player support personnel, umpire or match referee or any other person (including a spectator) during an international match.” It carries a punishment of five to six demerit points, which would trigger a ban of either one Test or two white-ball matches. Given Stokes’ next international assignment is the T20 series that concludes this tour, any level three charge would apply to those matches.It is more probable that Stokes, who currently has a clear disciplinary record with the ICC, will be charged with the level one offence of using an “audible obscenity” that would see him given one demerit point. Bans are triggered only when a player accumulates four demerit points or more.Stokes was caught by Rassie van der Dussen, off the bowling of Anrich Nortje, leaving England 157 for four. They advanced to 192 without further loss before bad light stopped play.After the close Stokes was subsequently pictured signing autographs by the same tunnel where the incident took place. The 28-year-old was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year last month after a summer when he played key roles during England’s first-ever World Cup win and the Ashes. Coincidentally, Sheeran, whom the BBC described as Stokes’ biggest fan in its promotional tweet, announced the cricketer’s Spoty nomination.Coming after Jofra Archer was racially abused by a spectator during the first Test against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui in November, this latest incident will again raise questions about the behaviour of supporters and the inability of stewards to identify offenders and eject them.The man who abused Archer received a two-year ground ban after being tracked down. The culprit of the admittedly less serious abuse of Stokes remained in the stadium and was not either identified or ejected.Ashley Giles, the England managing director of cricket, said: “It is disappointing that a member of the public has gone out of their way to abuse Ben as he was leaving the field. Ben is fully aware he should not have reacted in the way that he did and apologises for his actions.“In addition to this incident, members of our support staff were subjected to personal abuse during and after the day’s play. We have requested to the venue to ensure security and stewarding are enhanced for the remainder of the match so players and staff members can go about their duties without provocation.”Archer, was ruled out of the Test after pulling up during the warm-up. The 24-year-old had missed the previous Tests at Cape Town and Port Elizabeth with an injury to his right elbow that flared up early in the new year. He had been making good progress and was in England’s original XI for the Wanderers before he felt pain while bowling in the middle.Archer immediately went to see the team doctor, Anita Biswas, and, after a lengthy discussion, was close to tears when talking to Joe Root and the coach, Chris Silverwood.With questions over his workload, Archer must also now be a doubt for the three-match T20 series. Like Stokes he has been rested for the ODIs against South Africa that precede it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4537a9663ce36ed05ddfba46c4f77c3641069e3/0_119_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e246c418bb235a19a463c0db921f0015","title":"talking horses slate house shock cheltenham festival trials horse racing tips","story":"Colin Tizzard’s yard has been awash with classy staying chasers for the last few seasons and he has another on his hands in Slate House (2.25), who can land the Cotswold Chase on Cheltenham Trials day.

Sloppy play from the Russian who dumped a forehand into the net at deuce. The break point was a long, cagey and slow rally until Kyrgios changed it up with a drop shot. The drop shot wasn’t great, but the Russian chased it down and sent his backhand well long. John Isner retires down 6-4 *4-1 to Stan Wawrinka, sending the Swiss through to the fourth round. No confirmation on the injury but Isner was in long discussion with the doctor after falling down a double break.Nick Kyrgios just smashed down 3 aces to hold for 2-1 in 46 seconds. The crowd is already rowdy, the Aussie’s arm is already firing. We’re in for a good one.Garbine Muguruza and Elina Svitolina are also starting now. This head-to-head is a lot more extensive, with Svitolina leading 6-4. Muguruza won their last meeting in Wuhan last year, with Svitolina leading 2-1 in 2019.This match up is also clearer. Muguruza will be the player hitting with more risks, controlling the points and moving forward to finish points as quickly as she can. The big question is how many unforced errors Svitolina’s stellar defence can draw from her.Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov are on court. They have only faced each other once before, in that infamous Cincinnati match the Russian eventually won 6-7(3) 7-6(4) 6-2. It is difficult to take much from that match, except that Khachanov showed impressive focus to see out the win with so many distractions. There is little doubt that this match will rest on who serves best. In the rallies, Kyrgios will look to disrupt Khachanov at every opportunity with his variety and unpredictability. Kyrgios arrives in better form after two solid performances. By contrast, Khachanov barely survived No 78 Mikael Ymer in a final set tiebreak on Thursday. Let’s see.Over on Court 3, 15th seed Stan Wawrinka is up 5-3* on 19th seed John Isner. There were rumors today that Wawrinka would under the weather but so far so good for the Swiss.So what has happened so far today? The women have continued yesterday’s run of top 10 defeats with two further top 10 upsets. 2nd seed Karolina Pliskova was ousted 7-6(4) 7-6(3) by the talented and seasoned Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, seeded 30th. 6th seed Belinda Bencic, who memorably reached the US Open semis last year after upsetting defending champion Naomi Osaka, was destroyed by a zoning Anett Kontaveit 6-0 6-1 in just 49 minutes. Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber had no such problems and happily moved into the fourth round.In the men’s draw, Rafael Nadal eased past Pablo Carreno Busta 6-1 6-2 6-4 and Dominic Thiem came through a potentially tricky four set match against Taylor Fritz of the United States. The in-form Andrey Rublev, seeded 17th, marched on after beating 11th seed David Goffin. 10th seed Gael Monfils saw off Ernests Gulbis in straight sets.Hello! Welcome to another evening of Australian Open tennis as the final third round matches are completed. Absolutely nothing will come close to the carnage and drama of yesterday’s action, which saw Naomi Osaka fall to 15 year old Coco Gauff, Serena Williams upset by Wang Qiang, Stefanos Tsitsipas thoroughly beaten by Milos Raonic before Roger Federer barely survived a 5th set tiebreak against John Millman. However, there are some very interesting matches in store.Rod Laver Arena’s night session will begin with a curious battle between 5th seed Elina Svitolina and two-time slam champion Garbine Muguruza. Muguruza is unseeded after a dire 2019 in which her ranking tumbled and she struggled to find any of the form that propelled her to victories at Roland Garros in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017. She starts this year with a new coach, 1994 Wimbledon champ Conchita Martinez, and there have been some encouraging signs. This should reveal a lot about where Muguruza’s game is as she looks to return to the top 20 and beyond.Daniil Medvedev will follow against young Australian Alexei Popyrin. After 2019 ended with people certain that a new young slam champion would arrive in the new year, the first events of this new season have been a reality check. Medvedev has probably looked the best and he will be looking to continue his momentum and put himself in the position to compete for the title. Popyrin will have the opportunity to test out his game against a top player and in front of a home crowd. He should relish it.On Margaret Court Arena, 7th seed Alexander Zverev will face 2009 semi-finalist Fernando Verdasco and he will be looking to gain some momentum after a positive first few rounds in Melbourne. 9th seed and perennial dark horse Kiki Bertens will follow against Zarina Diyas.And then there is Melbourne Arena, where Nick Kyrgios returns to his favourite court for a match against Karen Khachanov of Russia. This is, of course, a rematch of that match in Cincinnati that lead to Kyrgios being put on probation. But Kyrgios is playing well in Melbourne and he looks comfortable. The Australian has reached only one slam fourth round since 2016 and this seems like a good opportunity to do so again. Let’s see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fdfea3f9d46f2ea5d7d250838cde2b1701a7072/0_24_4422_2653/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d45d434426c844bc0565b50298d56c","title":"south africa v england fourth test day two live","story":"Play due to start at 845 GMTFull disclosure right off the top-- I’m originally from the US and only started watching cricket about 6 months ago towards the end of the group stage of the World Cup.

Thoughtfully, Sky replayed the incident for the benefit of their viewers, so the match referee will have had plenty of time for a good look - and the look isn’t great if we’re honest.How big Stokes’ punishment, will be down to the whim of the ref - for reference, Kagiso Rabada got a demerit for his too-close-for-comfort celebration after dismissing Root at Port Elizabeth, and Jos Buttler was handed a demerit and fined 15 per cent of his match fee for chucking some abuse at Vernon Philander at Cape Town.Aside from that, England finished the day in jaunty enough spirits after a wonderful opening partnership - of 100+ for the first time in a first-innings for over a decade - between Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley, followed by a small but perfectly formed collapse, followed by Root and Pope handing out cocoa-dusted chocolate truffles to finish a rain and light-affected day. South Africa’s bowlers were cock-eyed after losing the toss until after tea, when line and length regrouped.And it all starts again at 8am.

Where’s the danger now? And will we ever get over the shock?Everything you know is a lie. Yesterday, the world was shaken to its very foundations when a video of Justin Bieber taking part in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke revealed that the whole thing is a sham, and James Corden doesn’t actually drive the car – rather, it’s towed by a truck.Frankly, from this point onwards, up is down and down is up. Who knows what to believe any more? If Corden doesn’t really drive the car on Carpool Karaoke, then what else has he been lying to us about? Did he really write Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, or did he use a ghostwriter? Are the 1,000-year-old eggs he uses in Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts really 1,000 years old? Next he’ll be telling us that he isn’t even really a hideous dancing CGI cat. How dare he? The man, quite honestly, deserves to spend the rest of his days sitting on a throne of fibs at the summit of Porky Pie Mountain.And before you accuse me of overreacting, let me point out that I am by no means alone in my shock. Once the pictures hit the internet, all hell broke loose. “I feel lied to,” raged one presumably former Corden fan on Twitter. “Haven’t felt this betrayed since finding out Santa Claus isn’t real,” screamed another, angry enough to punch the head clean off the next cardboard Peter Rabbit cinema standee she saw. The world is on my side here. We’re hurt and angry.Oh, sure, there have been other fakery scandals in the past. In 2007, BBC One’s controller was forced to resign after a documentary edited footage of the Queen to make her look slightly more grumpy than she actually was. The BBC’s Frozen Planet wildlife series was partly filmed in a zoo. The X Factor used to film its contestants flying business class to Los Angeles, before shunting them off to economy once the cameras stopped rolling. But that’s fine. You expect lies from BBC One and David Attenborough. But James Corden? Impeccable torch of moral virtue James Corden? No. Never.There will be those who will try to defend this scandal, claiming that it is simply standard practice for the TV industry and that it probably wouldn’t have been that safe for him to be so distracted while driving, but it’s too little, too late. The joy of Carpool Karaoke was never the singing. The singing part is terrible. Nobody wants to watch a professional singer drowned out by Corden howling and shrieking like a burning witch. That’s awful. It’s offensive on every level.But now, what’s the point? All this time – with Adele, with Mariah Carey, with Paul McCartney, when he let Stevie Wonder have a go at driving – Corden has been snuggled up all tight behind a tow truck. It’s heartbreaking. Never at any point was Corden ever in danger of accidentally mowing through a crowd of tourists and wrapping his car around a lamppost. Still, at least we’ve finally worked out how he got car insurance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eec3aa7ca885b286100a9e67a5a285643a72f1e/0_0_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffd56c25abe0e60afea49aa9cc74741","title":"some folks were tearful cia waterboarding on trial in guantanamo","story":"‘The Preacher’, one of three authorised to carry out torture method, has still not been identified after 17 years There were three men authorised by the CIA to carry out waterboarding on detainees in America’s “war on terror”. Two of them were contractors who are in Guantánamo Bay this week to give evidence. The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed.In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as “the Preacher” – a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees.According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their “enhanced interrogation techniques”, the Preacher “would at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, ‘Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?’”Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher’s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 911 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen – who is due to testify next week – have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners.Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.Defence lawyers at the Guantánamo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.“He’s the only witness we’ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,” Connell complained.Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the “middle management” who he believed was plotting against him.Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the “enhanced programme”. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the “new sheriff”, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.“Looks like they used your client as a training prop,” Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for “on-the-job training”. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee.The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The “high value detainees” were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise.Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back “until his shoulder blades were touching the floor”.In another, the prisoner’s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told “it was none of my fucking business”.When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said.Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer.Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice.He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to “stay the course”.In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself.“I wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,” Mitchell said. “It didn’t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat – kinda musky.”He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed.The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face coveredWhen his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning.“Buddy – you want it,” Mitchell told them. “Bring your rubber boots and come on down.”When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner’s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm.The visitors were stunned. “Some of the folks were tearful,” Mitchell said.“I was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,” Mitchell claimed. The psychologist’s eyes did indeed well up on a few occasions during his testimony this week, but the tears came when he was describing what he saw as his personal sacrifices. In contrast, he described waterboarding dispassionately, characterising it as “temporary discomfort”.“Does he care more about dog food commercials than he cares about human beings?” asked Terry Rockefeller, who was watching Mitchell’s testimony this week from the military commission’s public gallery on the other side of a reinforced glass partition.Her sister, Laura, was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. She was an actress who just happened to be working in the twin towers in New York on September 11, 2001, on a day job hosting a business seminar on risk assessment.Terry is a member of a relatives’ group called September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, which is seeking justice for the attacks but opposes the use of the death penalty.“The fact that he can talk about something like waterboarding in such clinical terms ... That’s just crushing to me, because my country did it and because I feel a great loss,” Rockefeller said, pointing out that the use of torture against the defendants has vastly complicated the process of putting them on trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b849c6078e891c7f0036660263ec11dc626d1c/0_352_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946398da2fa7ea390e99d6d6efa4f593","title":"overtourism in europe historic cities sparks backlash","story":"Angry protests from residents in popular areas force city hall officials to take actionAcross Europe, historic cities are buckling. Mass tourism, encouraged by cash-hungry councils after the 2008 crash and fuelled by the explosion of cheap flights and online room rentals, has become a monster. The backlash, however, has begun.Meanwhile Airbnb, the biggest but far from only holiday lettings platform, has reported triple-digit growth in several European cities over the past five years, driving 10 of them to ask the EU for help. The cities have between 10,000 and 60,000 listings each.The net result is that over the course of a year, popular short-break destinations such as Amsterdam and Barcelona host upwards of 18,000 visitors for each inhabitant, prompting angry protests from locals and forcing city halls to take action.It is not always evident, however, what that action should be – or if it will work. The trade-off between the revenues and jobs generated through tourism and quality of life is a tricky one. So the idea is not discouragement but management, say city halls.Overtourism in the historic centre of Amsterdam had gone beyond the already extreme nuisance of drunken visitors vomiting nightly on 17th-century doorsteps and urinating copiously in canals, according to city hall.With more than 19 million tourists in 2018 thronging a warren of narrow streets and alleyways that are home to 850,000 people, it was getting dangerous. “At times there was a real safety concern,” said Vera Al, of the finance and economic affairs department.The most crowded parts of the city – the red light district and the main nightlife areas of Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein – were becoming unliveable in the old centre shops selling wooden tulips, vacuum-packed cheese or cannabis seeds were replacing chemists, greengrocers and hairdressers. Doctors could no longer find surgery space.More than 60,000 jobs in Amsterdam are directly linked to tourism and visitors to the city spend more than €6bn (£5bn) annually.But over the past two years, the council has adopted tough measures. Tour coaches have mostly been banished to the outskirts and new shops catering solely to tourists have been outlawed by rewritten zoning regulations.There will be no new hotels once developers have exhausted existing licenses. Pending a possible outright ban in some neighbourhoods, Airbnb-style lets must sleep no more than four and cannot be let for more than 30 days a year.Some of the worst excesses, such as beer bikes – a pedal-powered mobile bar groups of drinkers – have been outlawed in the city centre. Tours of the red light district’s windows, running once every couple of minutes, are to be banned from 1 April, when all guided tours of the old centre will also require permits.The new mayor, Femke Halsema, has even tabled four possible options for the historic sex workers’ district, known as De Wallen. These include relocating all or part of it to other parts of the city, which would be a big call, politically, for part of the fabric of old Amsterdam.Somewhat less controversially, city hall has run several successful tourist awareness campaigns, including plastering large posters portraying residentson city centre doors, each bearing the slogan “We live here.”The concerted drive involves the mayor and all eight deputies. “It crosses all departments,” Al said. “None of it is rocket science, and we hope that taken together these measures will add up.”Nationally, said Elsje van Vuuren of the Dutch tourist board NBTC, the strategy is about dispersing visitors to lesser-known but equally attractive towns. The board has stopped promoting the Netherlands as a destination and aims instead to better manage the flow.Amsterdam has no illusions, however, that its programme will reduce the number of tourists visiting the city – or even significantly slow a rate of growth due to bring 40 million visitors a year to the Netherlands by 2030.“The focus is really about restoring liveability for all those who have been affected,” said Al. “It’s about making residents feel at home again. They shouldn’t feel like strangers in their own city. We believe a city is first for living in. Only second for visiting.”About 30 million people will visit Barcelona this year, a seemingly unstoppable tide, which has prompted exasperated residents to resort to ill-concealed irony.“Don’t tell anyone you have been on holiday to Barcelona,” reads one leaflet recently handed out to tourists. “They will steal the city from us, and it will stop being attractive to you and liveable for us.”The city’s response is improved management. Its Plan 2020 initiative aims to change “from managing tourism in the city, to managing the tourist city” – although Xavier Marcé, the councillor responsible, insists residents take priority.“I’m not interested in managing a tourist city,” he said. Dispersal is the answer, Marcé believes: the problem is not so much that Barcelona has sold itself but that it’s sold itself badly. Aware the sector brings in about €10bn a year, he said: “We don’t want more tourists but that doesn’t mean we want fewer.”As the city’s well-known sites, such as the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla and Park Güell are over-subscribed, the idea is to ert people to other areas and activities. The city is in talks with booking and others to devise an alternative visitor’s package.Barcelona has also declared a moratorium on new hotels in its most touristed areas, pushing visitors to the periphery (although as Pere Mariné of the 120-member Federation of Barcelona Residents’ Associations noted, where people sleep “doesn’t make much difference. They all want to go to the Sagrada Familia.”)Despite trying hard, the city seems unable to control the rise of Airbnb and others. According to a Victoria University study, Barcelona has the highest density of tourist apartments in Europe: 12 for every 1,000 residents, compared with 10 in Rome and seven in London.The battle to reduce the number of available beds will not affect the millions of daytrippers. As many as 20,000 a day disembark from cruise ships to head for the sites but spend little ashore. More arrive by coach, clogging up and polluting the city.Marcé plans to force coaches to park on Barcelona’s perimeter and their passengers to use the already saturated public transport network extra buses will be financed by a new Barcelona tourist tax, he says.While residents are fed up with mass tourism, Mariné says there is no real popular movement for change, partly because tourists mean jobs. A demo with the slogan “Barcelona is not for sale” drew 2,000 people: “That’s not going to change anything.”Ultimately, the city’s powers are limited and the Catalan regional government tends to share the hospitality industry’s view that more is better. As tour operators survey the growing Asian market, millions more are due to discover Barcelona’s not-so-secret treasures. Stephen BurgenSick of the sight of tourists picnicking on the steps of Renaissance monuments, the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, announced in 2017 that he would douse the surfaces with water to keep people at bay.The hosepipe ploy never became permanent, only being used a couple of times on the steps of key monuments, such as the Basilica of Santa Croce, the burial place of Michelangelo, and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito. But the message resonated.“There does seem to have been a rise in awareness and sensitivity among visitors,” said Cecilia Del Re, Florence’s councillor for tourism and the environment. “We did a lot of campaigning, telling people not to throw their rubbish on the street and to respect the city, and this is showing some results.”Hefty fines for people caught scrawling their name on the Ponte Vecchio or peeing in the street in the historic centre, a Unesco world heritage site, have also improved decorum.Attracting 14 million tourists a year, Florence is Italy’s most-visited city after Venice and Rome. Boasting a huge and rich variety of the world’s heritage and surrounded by Tuscany’s rolling hills, the city’s popularity is easy to understand.But as with Venice and Rome, the growth in tourism has seen residents driven out of town by the rising cost of living and arrival of Airbnb: according to a Siena university study, one in five properties in the historic centre is advertised as a short-term let.Some measures, however, seem to be paying off. “One of the main issues is that everyone is so focused on the historic centre, which is only a 5km sq area in a city of 105km sq,” said Del Re. “So we are heavily promoting areas outside of the centre.“We are also close to launching an app that will direct people to other sites if, for example, the Uffizi Gallery is too crowded.” The city is also working with lesser known, but equally beautiful, towns in Tuscany, such as Arezzo, to promote them.City leaders are against imposing daily limits on the numbers who can enter the centre, but have increased tenfold the cost of taking tour buses that bring people to the city for a couple of hours. They are also promoting “congress tourism”, where people visit the city for a conference or business meeting and stay for a few days.Meanwhile, Florence authorities have converted some public property into social housing to motivate young people to move in. “We want to re-incentivise people to live in the historic centre,” said Del Re. Angela GuiffridaThe crowds surging into Prague’s majestic Old Town Square to witness last year’s seasonal illumination of Christmas lights were so vast that ambulance crews and squads of police officers were needed in case things got out of hand.The packed scene and cosmopolitan nature of the gathered multitudes seemed to attest to a marketing triumph that had assisted the Czech capital’s arrival as a first-rank global tourist draw.Yet the vast number of foreign visitors crammed into the modestly sized square crystallised what has become one of Prague authorities’ biggest headaches, prompting a major rethink of its tourism strategy that may eventually include a crackdown on short-term lettings.The sheer numbers drawn by the beautiful but relatively small medieval old town – encompassing Prague castle, the 600-year-old Charles bridge and a maze of ancient cobbled streets – has put a strain on resources and quality of life that many long-established residents find intolerable.A rising exodus of native residents and the growth of often tacky tourist shops at the expense of those catering for locals finally forced the authorities to act.The first step is a major publicity campaign to encourage visitors to explore greater Prague, a city of 1.4 million residents, beyond the limited quarter on either bank of the River Vltava, where the majority of its most storied buildings, as well as touristy restaurants and pubs, are located.“Too many people are coming just for a very small number of purposes, of buildings,” said Pavel Čižinský, the former mayor of the Prague 1 municipality, which includes the historic old town district. “To disperse the tourists more, I think it is necessary to involve more those who are running the tourist industry.“The guides must say to their groups, do you want to go through these crowds where everything is twice as expensive, or do you want to go and see something which is maybe half a kilometre from Charles bridge, but which is also nice.”The local tourist authority has published brochures called Prague Walks promoting the attractions of other neighbourhoods of historic interest, including Vinohrady, Karlín, Holešovice and Žižkov. For the strategy to work, however, strategists need to succeed in a far trickier goal: persuading visitors to come back for another look.Compounding the rising volume of visitors has been the growth of alcohol-fuelled tourism spurred by the Czech Republic’s deserved reputation as home to some of the world’s best, and cheapest, beer.Lucrative organised pub crawls and stag nights have become the bane of many locals’ lives, with high noise levels and rowdy behaviour commonplace in a city centre residential area that is home to about 25,000 Praguers.

Brendan uprooted yet another casualty of the kind that now threatens that magical avenue. Four years ago Storm Gertrude toppled two of the 200-year-old trees. Their timber was swiftly transfigured into 10 heavy doors, quite masterfully engraved with dragons, direwolves and the odd kraken sigil. Installed in tourist pubs and restaurants and featured on the glossy Thrones website, this was an impressive initiative. A similar spirit, perhaps, helped carry Northern Ireland through the three-year vacancy game of Stormont’s own thrones. At the North’s Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, for example, civil servants decided it was time the province had an environment strategy. “Under normal circumstances,” its website confided, “officials would have taken our policy direction from the minister . . .” Without a political boss, it invited “big ideas” from the public for use when the next one came along.The minister appointed this month from the ranks of the DUP has strong views of his own. Edwin Poots is a Free Presbyterian, creationist and denier of evolution. He concurs with the 17th century Archbishop Ussher of Armagh that the date of creation could be set at 4004 BC.None of this, it must be said, should predispose Poots against the conservation of bioersity, composed of all God’s creatures and an indispensable thread of any environment strategy. In 2010, as then minister for the environment, he introduced a permanent ban on hare coursing, readily endorsed by the Assembly. How Poots feels about badgers is not on record, but his new responsibility for agriculture lands him with the problem of high levels of bovine TB that join Brexit at the head of farmers’ concerns. His department chiefs again took new initiatives on their own. A scientific partnership, announced in 2018, seems bound to lead to some urgent decisions on preemptive badger culling. The spur for developing an environment strategy was publication of the UK’s State of Nature report for 2019. An earlier report, in 2016, showed that Northern Ireland was the most nature-depleted part of the UK, itself one of the most nature-depleted places in the world. After a long decline, the new report shows no let-up in loss of wildlife in the North. Some of its figures are all-Ireland threat estimates. But warnings, for example, on the future of breeding curlews and other waders, speak from a long record of local research. “Most original habitats have gone,” mourns the Ulster Wildlife Trust, “and natural ecosystems are fragmented. One in five of our species face extinction.”Lough NeaghIntensive farming takes up three-quarters of Northern Ireland. Framed often by neat, close-cropped hedges, its cattle, poultry and pig farms generate quite a disproportionate share of UK levels of ammonia, the report shows.The impact was illustrated dramatically at Moninea Bog in the southwest, a raised bog and Special Area of Conservation. Ammonia from a neighbouring farm severely damaged the bog vegetation, bleaching its mosses and killing algae on trees. Measures to reduce ammonia emissions are expected to benefit bioersity “within five to 10 years”.Farming run-off has historically polluted Lough Neagh, the biggest lake in these islands and a special arena for the North’s wildlife. It holds a notable population of pollan, a herring-like freshwater fish left over from the last ice age, and its eels continue to support a precarious traditional industry.The lake in winter also attracts thousands of migrant European waterbirds. But in 2013, researchers at Quercus, the Centre for Bioersity and Conservation Science at Queen’s University, reported a dramatic decline in the wintering duck population. It had fallen from 100,000 to less than 21,000, or 75 per cent over a decade.DredgingSome of the decline could be attributed to climate change, as the lakes feeding waterbirds in northeastern Europe stay ice-free in winter. But the Quercus team drew another conclusion: that the North’s farming environment schemes have reduced the organic run-off that boosted populations of water snails and other invertebrates, the food of wintering ducks.This finds no place in the 2019 State of Nature report, which does note six additional ducks for the region’s threatened red list. Nor does it delve into the long campaign by environmentalists to stop the commercial licensed dredging from Lough Neagh of some 1.5 millions of tonnes of sand a year.And Northern Ireland still has no national park, 18 years after the Mourne Mountains were selected. Resistance from resident farmers has delayed every effort at decision. In 2010 Poots put it off further. “We need to think carefully, and to debate fully,” he said, “what a Northern Ireland National Park should be like.”With farmers, environment and rural affairs in his care, he still has everyone to please."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150511.1579903935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seamus mallon tributes paid from across political spectrum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeamus Mallon and  John Hume at the SDLP 33rd annual conference at the Wellington Park Hotel, Belfast in 2004. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Tributes have been paid from across the political spectrum to Seamus Mallon, the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and deputy leader of the SDLP, who has died age 83.Mr Mallon served as deputy to John Hume for two decades, and was a trenchant critic of both republican violence and discrimination against nationalists.In a statement, Pat and John Hume said that “history will remember Seamus as one of the great Irish patriots and peacemakers.“He was a man of huge strength and courage, who stood with John for many years in the fight for justice, peace and reconciliation on this island.”They said Mr Mallon was “fearless” in condemning violence, and that “his clarity, insight and political nous sustained the SDLP.”President Michael D Higgins said Mr Mallon’s reputation as a “politician and community activist of unsurpassed courage, civility and fairness is held by all those who had the privilege of knowing him.“Few people have influenced the peace process in Northern Ireland more than Seamus Mallon, a formidable opponent and, a tough negotiator in speech and act, but always honest and honourable.”Colum Eastwood, the current SDLP leader, said Mr Mallon was an Irish patriot. “He lived for our country and has left an indelible mark on the lives of everyone who enjoys the peace he helped to forge.”In a joint statement, First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill paid tribute to Mr Mallon.Ms Foster said he was “instrumental in bringing about peace for our people and that contribution should not go unrecognised”. And Ms O’Neill described him as “a significant political figure” whose “mark on our history is indelible”.‘Extraordinary contribution’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted: “History will remember Seamus as an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, a committed peace builder and a tireless champion of an inclusive Ireland.”Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said she was “saddened” to learn of his death and he would be remembered for his contribution to Irish politics over many decades as the SDLP deputy leader and the key role he played in achieving the Good Friday Agreement.”Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin expressed “ deep sadness” at the death of Mallon. “Seamus made an immeasurable contribution to the cause of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland,” he said.British government Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith said Mr Mallon “dedicated his political career to making Northern Ireland a better place”.Mr Mallon served as deputy to first minister David Trimble in the first Northern Ireland Executive in 1999.Lord Trimble said his role in brokering the Belfast Agreement was a “huge” achievement.“Even though from then to now there have been huge ups and downs in the political system, there has been no move away from peace.”Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said Mr Mallon was a key negotiator for the SDLP in the talks leading to the agreement. “Seamus was strong with courage and he had commitment to peace and making progress for Northern Ireland and this whole island.”A statement from former US president Bill Clinton said: “Hillary and I are saddened by the passing of Seamus Mallon, a hero of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a profoundly good man.“A teacher in practice and in heart, the lessons of his life and power of his example are as important today as ever.”Former British prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Mallon was “one of the most important architects of peace in Northern Ireland. Brave, blunt, often prepared to swim against the tide if he felt it right, he was someone deeply respected and admired across the troubled landscape of Irish politics.”‘Likable stubborness’Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Archbiship of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, said the people of Armagh had “lost one of our most respected sons and bravest leaders”.He called for a renewed effort by political leaders to build a shared home place on the island of Ireland as a “fitting tribute to his legacy”.Tom Kelly, a close political ally and former vice-chair of the SDLP who worked as Mr Mallon’s Westminster assistant in the late 1980s and then on most of his elections, said the former deputy first minister had a “transformative” effect on Northern Ireland, complimenting SDLP leader John Hume.“John Hume painted with broad strokes, Seamus Mallon did detail,” Mr Kelly told The .He said Mr Mallon’s relationship with David Trimble was “an odd one, but it worked”. Mr Mallon could be “Thran” – a Northern word meaning stubborn, but it was “ a likable stubborness”.“But his strength was that his instincts chimed with those of the nationalist community, specifically in rural areas when he said something, it was how people felt, they just couldn’t articulate it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150329.1579884695!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"can the state afford to roll back on the pensions time bomb","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPensioners Christy Waters from Clondalkin, Dublin,  and Pat Daly from Galway at the launch of Siptu’s Stop 67 campaign to reverse the pension age increase. Photograph Nick BradshawIt started with Martin Walsh’s Wednesday lunchtime call last week to RTÉ’s Liveline – a day after Leo Varadkar called the election on January 14th – to complain about his deferred pension.His call to Joe Duffy started a wider debate about the State pension age and the phased plan to raise it, turning it – unexpectedly – into a key issue of this general election.It has left political parties engaging in “auction politics” as they scramble to find solutions, with little or no certainty around the cost in order to appease a powerful political and outspoken bloc of citizens: 60-something voters.“This is grey power coming out now, and the thing is that older people vote,” said Paul Kenny, a former pensions ombudsman.Walsh’s story is typical of the people affected. His grievance was having to sign on the dole for the jobseeker’s allowance to tide him over until next year when his State pension kicks in at 67, despite 49 years of work. This stopgap measure would leave him €45 a week short or €2,350 a year.Politicians reported similar anger on the doorsteps among people being forced to retire at 65 but unable to claim their public pension until 66 after the qualifying age was raised by a year in 2014.To qualify for the allowance or means-tested payments to bridge the gap until their State pension payments start people must show that they are capable of working and are available for and genuinely seeking work. This is not something people retiring from work expect to have to do.The proposed rise to 67 from the start of next year was a bridge too far for many pensioners – the qualifying age is to increase again to 68 in 2028.While the Government has taken steps to protect public sector workers, private sector employees – where companies continue to force people to retire at 65 under set contracts – are exposed.“That was like striking a match in a petrol tank. It just went viral,” said Kenny.Signing on for the dole when you were expecting you pension after a lifetime of work amounted to “absolute indignity”, said Ethel Buckley, Siptu’s deputy general secretary at the trade union’s launch on Thursday of a coalition of groups hoping to stop the State pension age rising to 67 next year.Party promisesThe political reaction to the clamour for a fix made a truism of the old election saying that candidates campaign in poetry but govern in prose.The election pledges to fix the problem came as thick and fast as rhyming couplets, in contrast to past wordy warnings in government reports about unsustainable State pension liabilities.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said last weekend that it was irresponsible not to increase the pension age in line with longer life expectancy, but he recognised the anomalies this caused.To fix them Fine Gael on Friday proposed in its election manifesto a new “State transition pension” of €248 a week, at a cost of €150 million, for those retiring at 66.The party is also planning to introduce a “State pathway pension” for those who had to retire at 65, which will maintain the same payments but eliminate all the criteria and restrictions applying in the jobseeker’s allowance.Fianna Fáil has promised in its manifesto to pay a transition State pension for 65- and 66-year-olds, and to defer next year’s phased increase to 67 pending a review by a new commission to examine the issue.The party’s leader, Micheál Martin, also wants to outlaw contracts that force people to retire at 65.Sinn Féin and People Before Profit have pledged to restore the pension age to 65, at a cost of about €450 million a year, while Labour says it would not support the pension age rising to 67.The cost of stopping the pension age rising to 67 is estimated at more than €200 million a year, with pension experts disputing the €470 million annual cost cited by Fianna Fáil’s spokesman on social protection Willie O’Dea this week as the Government’s own.Reducing the age to 65 would cost €150 million a year, but that would be a gross cost given that the jobseeker’s allowance would be about €119 million, leaving a net cost of €31 million annually.Given that the Social Insurance Fund – the State’s coffers into which PRSI is paid and from which State pensions are paid out – has a surplus of €1.4 billion, these costs on first glance (or at least on the surface) look manageable.Ageing populationHowever, in the slow revolving world of long-term pension planning it is not the cost of paying State pension entitlements to the retired or soon-to-be retired workers that is expensive it is the heavy financial strain of an ageing population and the cost of paying pensions for people retiring over the coming decades who will live longer, well beyond retirement age. There is potential for the fund to run out of cash.The last Government’s Roadmap for Pension Reform 2018-2023, published in July, said the number of pensioners will more than double and the ratio of working-age people to pensioners will fall to two to one.The population of pensioners is set to rise from 586,000 in 2015 to 1.4 million by 2055. “This presents significant funding challenges, with the Social Insurance Fund forecast to accumulate a potential deficit of up to €400 billion over the next 50 years,” the report said.An actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund by accountants KPMG at the end of 2015 (published in September 2017) put the net present value of future shortfalls at €335 billion.The accountants forecast a projected shortfall in the fund of €200 million this year, rising to €3.3 billion by 2030 and €22.2 billion by 2071. Without spending cuts or PRSI increases, State subventions to the fund would need to rise to €1.7 billion by 2025, €5.6 billion by 2035, and €11.4 billion by 2045.In 2017, the estimated cost of public sector pensions to the State – for about 155,000 workers then receiving a pension and a further 300,000 accruing benefits – rose to €114.5 billion, according to a report by John Pender of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland in a report for the Department of Finance.This was an increase of 17 per cent or €16.5 billion in just three years.“The proportion of workers-to-pensioners is going to go down so we have fewer and fewer people paying tax and social insurance to support an increasing population of pensioners – that’s the reality,” said Kenny.Older peopleActuary and pensions expert Tony Gilhawley urged politicians promoting solutions “as a populist vote-getting proposal” to “think of the children and grandchildren who will have to pay for it”.“Increasing the State pension and reducing the age now is in effect writing cheques we expect our children and children’s children to honour in the future. But this will become increasingly difficult when they are supporting more and more older people.”As a solution he supports a means-tested bridging pension from 65 to the State pension age “for those who are genuinely in need”.One aspect that had been overlooked amid the sweep of promises, according to Gilhawley, is that if the State pension age reverted to 65 or stalled at 66, public service employees who joined after January 1st, 2013, would have to have their terms amended, bringing a “double” cost.On the longer-term pensions problem, Siptu researcher Michael Taft, an economist, dismissed the “myth” of the so-called “pensions time bomb” at the union’s Stop 67 launch to halt the rising pension age. He said it was intended to “close down debate” and scaremonger.He believes that Ireland’s youngest population in Europe and one of the highest State pension ages puts the country in a good place, though he acknowledged that the State would have to increase resources to pay for pensions in the future.He said the 2015 estimate on State pension fund deficits needed to be revised as they were based on figures in the recession when “nobody saw the strength of the recovery”. Siptu wants a “stakeholder forum” to examine ideas and evidence so as to mull new proposals to tackle the problem.Jerry Moriarty, chief executive of the Irish Association of Pension Funds, welcomed the idea of expert groups looking at the issue to cater for options where some people are happy to work longer.Work longerHe said it was a “myth” to think the only way of dealing with the pension challenge “is to raise the retirement date to make everyone work longer”.However, Kenny warned that erting money to pay pensions a year earlier than planned would inevitably take discretionary spending from other areas such as health.Longer-term, he believes that future emigration to countries with more lucrative job prospects will lure away many younger workers, the State’s income engine who could pay for a greying population.“There is a time bomb. Some people might go into denial about it, but the reality is that a lot of the young people who will be coming on stream, going through the educational system here, will not be working here.”He said the election promises “distort the debate because people take these promises at face value. It may be very difficult to honour those promises.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150382.1579887098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 i have quietly said to myself does loyalty exist nowadays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil candidate Eugene Murphy meets Son Doyle and his son Kenny, in their Roscommon factory. Photograph: Brian FarrellMurphy, the only Fianna Fáil deputy for Roscommon-Galway in the 32nd Dáil, leans in through the window for chat, as the vehicle pulls over near the Roscommon Arts Centre on the outskirts of the town. The woman declines to give her name to The  but Murphy afterwards relays the gist of the conversation with a knowing and satisfied nod.“She said: ‘I didn’t like what was done.’”He is referencing the last-minute addition by the party hierarchy of Orla Leyden, a local councillor and daughter of Fianna Fáil Senator and former minister Terry Leyden, to the Fianna Fáil ticket in the tight, three-seat constituency. Murphy is well known around Leinster House for his sunny demeanour and endearingly high-pitched voice but his mood at the outset of Election 2020 is far from his trademark bubble and squeak. But he has a more electorally potent weapon – sympathy – and is not afraid to use it. Few things in politics play better than a perceived shaft from them up above in headquarters. Sympathy card“You know I am under a bit of pressure,” he says quietly to voters as he goes about his business. “Things happen in politics, but nobody would stand for Fianna Fáil in 2016. I am not some super sub.”In Casey’s filling station – a huge plaza that includes a Londis, a coffee shop, Supermac’s and much else besides – he pushes the sympathy card hard.May Feeney from Ballymacurley, who has been working in Casey’s for 14 years, doesn’t think Murphy has much to worry about. “I think he’ll make it,” she says. “He’s a nice fella.” Feeney, like other voters on the canvass, says the future of Roscommon Hospital is the number one issue locally.“I’d say the hospital is the biggest issue of the lot, to get more beds from the way it is.”Seán Fitzmaurice (65) and from Ballygar in Galway is a Fianna Fáil supporter but declines to say if he will vote for Murphy or Leyden.“Well, I have to make up my mind on that,” he says. “I am not going to tell you.” Fitzmaurice raises the increase in the age at which people become eligible for the State pension, an issue that has featured heavily in the campaign to date.“I think I should get my pension if I wanted to go. I am not saying I am going. That’s a mistake that should be reversed. Fianna Fáil said they’d do it, but I don’t hear them talking about it.”Alphabetical orderIt is clear Murphy feels bruised by the addition of Leyden, and argues that she initially withdrew from the selection convention for the general election. He faced a similar situation at the 2016 election, when former Roscommon goalkeeper Shane “Cake” Curran was added by party HQ after Murphy was selected at convention.Murphy takes a call from a local party organiser as he drives back to his constituency office and they discuss the design of election literature. “It goes on alphabetical order,” Murphy says reassuringly to himself, as it becomes apparent that Leyden’s name is set to come first on the Fianna Fáil constituency flyers.Micheál Martin visited Lanesborough in the neighbouring Longford-Westmeath constituency the previous evening, just near Murphy’s Strokestown home. The fact that Leyden was photographed shaking the party leader’s hand – even making it on to RTÉ’s evening news – is recounted with a shake of the head. “I won’t comment,” Murphy says when asked if he has made his displeasure known at Leyden’s addition known to Martin. “Look it, the decision has been made.”Supporting Martin’s call to enter into a confidence-and-supply agreement with Fine Gael wasn’t easy, he adds. “I have quietly said to myself, does any loyalty exist nowadays. That’s all I’ll say. Politics can be a strange business.”Territory carve-upYet a hint of defiance enters his voice at the prospect of a directive from party headquarters ordering a carve-up of territory between the two candidates.“I have made it quite clear I am not going to agree to any ide. There has been no official communication in terms of a ide but even if it comes I won’t be doing it.”He says there is a risk the party could lose its seat in Roscommon-Galway, although most predict Murphy, along with outgoing Independents Michael Fitzmaurice and Denis Naughten, will be returned.“If it is a Fianna Fáil-led government, which I believe it will be under Micheál Martin, and we don’t have government representation in this constituency, it is bad news.”And if the party does win two seats, Murphy puts Martin on a bit of notice.“There’ll be nobody happier and I’ll be knocking on the door of Micheál to get some ministerial representation for the area.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150397.1579904878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"men like seamus mallon don t come along too often","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeamus Mallon was an architect of the Northern Ireland peace process and a key figure in negotiating the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Photograph: PALast night representatives of the SDLP’s foundation generation and current one reflected on the political and historic importance of Seamus Mallon, who has died after a short illness aged 83.“He was a giant of a man,” said his friend, Bríd Rodgers, a contemporary and former colleague in the Northern Executive where he served as deputy first minister from 1998 to 2001, with Ulster Unionist David Trimble as first minister.“Ireland has lost one of its most fierce champions for justice, equality and peace,” said present SDLP leader Colum Eastwood (36), recently elected as MP for Foyle.Mr Mallon from Markethill, Co Armagh, died on Friday. He was diagnosed with cancer late last year and, according to Ms Rodgers who last visited him on Christmas Eve, was prepared and reconciled for what was to come.And recalling their days from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, through to the foundation of the party and failed Sunningdale powersharing executive of 1974, to the heady days of the 1998 Belfast Agreement and, finally, the powersharing institutions just restored, Ms Rodgers characterised Mr Mallon as a politician with a “fixed moral compass”.She recalled also how he was assailed from many sides, including facing death threats, for the principled stances he took throughout his political life.‘A force of nature’Mr Eastwood said he joined the SDLP “because of people like Seamus Mallon”, describing him as “a force of nature”.Mr Mallon was a former teacher. He served as MP for Newry and Armagh and also as Assembly member for the same constituency. From 1979 he was deputy leader of the SDLP with John Hume as leader, both men viewed as pivotal in achieving the peace. The two had occasional differences but were respectful of each other.With John Hume quite ill it was last night left to his wife, Pat Hume, to pay tribute. “History will remember Seamus as one of the great Irish patriots and peacemakers,” she said.And she added: “Men like Seamus Mallon don’t come along too often.”Mr Mallon is predeceased by his wife Gertrude and is survived by his daughter Orla, son-in-law Mark and granddaughter Lara."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150318.1579884459!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters in d%C3%BAn laoghaire every single way i look at it it s difficult","story":"Jennifer O\u0027Connell speaks to mothers attending the Turtle Tots baby and toddler swimming class in Dun Laoghaire and asks what are the important issues for them in this election.

Photograph: Bryan O’ BrienAnnie, Ruairí, Sebastian, Rory, Shea and Benjamin don’t have a lot to say about the election – but then, with an average age of eight months, they don’t have all that much to say about anything. For the parents getting them ready for their Turtle Tots class – which is designed to introduce infants and toddlers from three months to the basics of water safety – there’s one issue dominating discussions.It was Bill Clinton’s strategist, James Carville, who mastered the art of the three-word campaign slogan: “The economy, stupid.” Here, in a constituency with creche fees that are the highest in the country, at €256 per week, it’s childcare, stupid.The first to arrive for the 10am class are Ruth Daly and seven-month-old daughter Annie Kelly. Daly is undecided about the election, and wrestling with bigger decisions personally than how to vote on February 8th. She is due back to her job as a nurse from maternity leave in April. Her partner is also a nurse, which makes finding childcare that works for them even more problematic. “We can’t afford childcare,” she says simply.And because they’re both nurses, “a creche doesn’t really work for us anyway. The hours don’t work they don’t match.”“So the best solution at the moment is that, because we’re both working in the same hospital, we would probably try to work opposite shifts. So we won’t see each other, but we’ll see her, and she’ll be looked after.”She watched the debate during the week, but she wasn’t won over by anything promised by either Taoiseach Leo Varadkar or Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin on the housing front. She’s worried that Fianna Fáil’s proposed new special savings incentive allowance (SSIA) to help first-time buyers save for a deposit and Fine Gael’s €30,000 promised tax break “will possibly drive prices up anyway”.How does the future look for her and her family? “It looks as if it’s going to be a struggle, to be honest. Owning my own property having my baby looked after staying in the healthcare system as a nurse. Every single way I look at it, it’s difficult. I said on a whim last night: We’ll just go to Canada, we’ll just leave.”That’s a recurring refrain among her friends, she says. “Young people here that want to start their families and their lives are saying, let’s just leave.”She looks at her daughter. “Maybe if this one hadn’t come along, we maybe would already gone for a year or two years. Saudi Arabia is definitely calling a lot of my friends and colleagues. We can still go. We can still pack up with little one and go.”With only two of the four incumbent TDs standing again here – meaning Fine Gael’s chances of holding on to its three seats are dramatically reduced – Fianna Fáil and the Greens will be both hoping to win over undecided voters. All of the parents who speak to The  on Thursday fit that category none have yet been swayed yet by the promises of any of the 13 candidates.Childcare insuranceAs she wraps 10-month-old Ruairí in a towel after his swimming class, Siobhán Gannon says she does know what she wants to ask canvassers who might call to her door. The first question is about insurance. “How are they going to address insurance costs? There’s one insurer left in Dublin to insure childcare, soft plays, bouncy castles – all the things young families want. After that, it’s ‘what can you do for young families?’”She’s also wrestling with the cost of childcare. “I’m due back at work next week, and it’s a big decision whether I’ll go back or not. The cost of childcare is almost the same as what I earn . . . So that’s a big consideration. I spent many, many years in college and I’ve done a PhD. Did I really spend all those years studying to not work, and to not set a good example to them?”As she makes up her mind, she’ll be looking for “positive suggestions instead of rhetoric . . . Let’s look to other countries and cherry pick the best solutions.”Once again, childcare is among the key issues for Murieann O’Donnell, mother to Rory, and Brona Karlsson, who’s here with her son, Sebastian. Other “key issues for all families will be healthcare, education and housing crisis, particularly for young families. They’re all having to move out of Dublin,” says O’Donnell.Rising insurances costs means parents how have a new worry to add to their list: “It’s in the back of your mind. What happens if the creche has to close?”Sebastian is Karlsson’s second child. Among the parents here, she alone sounds a warning note about the economy – specifically, she is concerned about the Government’s ability to attract multinationals outside the tech sector.Green issues“We need to think global, and I’m just not sure that in every sector we do. I appreciate in tech that there are a lot of companies here, but I think that it’s quite limited. We have such a well-educated, well-rounded cohort of people coming out of third level, and I just think that if we just had the ersity of jobs to offer them, Ireland could really prosper.”Environmental concerns are important to her too. Might that translate into a first-preference for the Greens? She thinks about this briefly. “Yes . . . As Greta Thunberg says, what we do now, we can’t undo. So it’s going to affect their future.”It was the promise of good employment prospects, the chance to own their own home and a better quality of life that attracted Kristi Fetherston, who came to Ireland with her Mayo-born husband last March from New York. Their son, Shea, was born here. “He’s the reason we came,” she says, as he falls asleep in his carseat after a vigorous swim.So far, they’re happy with the decision, and “how welcoming everyone has been. It’s the little gestures. People eager to hold the door for the stroller. People eager to offer to hold him, or just to give me a kind nod when he’s crying on the train.”There have been some rude awakenings too, however. “One of the reasons we left New York city was because we expected the housing to be more affordable. And I . . .” her voice trails off. “It’s shocking actually. It feels a bit like New York city.”As an American citizen, she won’t be voting, but her Irish husband will, and they’ve been talking about the issues at stake. Beyond housing, “I think there are not nearly enough creches. I’m on a million waiting lists . . . even the policies around wait lists for creches and schools feel a little crazy. I’d like to see something to take the stress and anxiety out of that.”Kristian Oglend, who’s here with his son, Benjamin, is the only father at the pool this morning. From Norway, he won’t be voting in the election either, but he does have a few things on his wish list for families.The family relocated to Dublin for his wife’s job, and he likes it for its playgrounds, friendliness and free GP care for under sixes, but he has been dismayed by how inaccessible buildings are for wheelchair users and buggy pushers. And – once again – there’s childcare. In Norway, he says, the average cost per child is €3,400 per year. “Here you pay €1,000 per month. That’s crazy.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150527.1579900737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pall hangs over germany ahead of auschwitz anniversary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVisitors at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in Oranienburg, Berlin. Sachsenhausen was the first camp to test the use of gas chambers.  Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesOn Monday some 200 survivors of Auschwitz-Birkenau will have a stark message for the world when they gather one last time, to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp.“We have a dark premonition because we know” is the motto of this year’s gathering, as new waves of anti-Semitism, populism and nationalist extremism spread across Europe and the world.Amid efforts by some countries to reframe their war responsibility or relativise Holocaust horrors, the urgent warning from the final eyewitnesses is clear: beware the beginnings.If the Auschwitz gas chambers are the end, the beginnings can be found 570km northeast: a grand villa, glowing bright in the flat winter sun, on the shore of the calm Wannsee lake outside Berlin.It was here on January 20th, 1942, during a brisk 90-minute breakfast meeting, that 15 senior Nazi officials and bureaucrats collated and streamlined efforts to murder Europe’s Jews.“The meeting was conducted very quickly and with much courtesy, the waiters served cognac,” recalled Adolf Eichmann during his trial in Israel in 1960. He was made logistics man for what he called the “killing business” and kept minutes of the meeting, all copies of which were to be destroyed.‘European Jewish question’One copy survived and is stored in the foreign ministry villa visitors can inspect a facsimile detailing “ . . . this final solution for the European Jewish question considers 11 million Jews”.This week a new €2 million exhibition was unveiled at the Wannsee villa, casting fresh light on the blueprint for the Holocaust. The exhibition is a complete departure from its predecessor, criticised by many visitors for being text-heavy and off-putting.\u0026nbspMuseum director Hans-Christian Jasch says the aim now is to encourage visitors to linger longer and reflect on how the Holocaust was not simply a top-down endeavour.“There was a high level of societal participation,” he said. “Many motives are documented as to how ordinary people participated in the murder of Jews.”Just as the orders were not carried out in isolation, the new exhibition highlights the “conducive political climate” for anti-Semitism at the time, which made possible the persecution of ethnic minorities and the Jewish population.As well as the new exhibition, the Wannsee Conference museum has a new seminar programme for a wide range of visitor groups, from police to nurses, to discuss reacting to ethical questions then and abuses of power in their working lives today.Watching the opening of the new exhibition with a wary gaze was Éva Pusztai-Fahidi. The 95-year-old Auschwitz survivor suggested the Hungarian Jews in her homeland were “hypnotised” by the Nazis. Even when discriminatory anti-Jewish laws came into effect, curtailing their rights and squeezing them out of society, they couldn’t believe the looming danger.Gas chambers and flamethrowersDespite converting to Catholicism, she was rounded up with her parents and sister and, on July 1st, 1944, arrived in Auschwitz.She was the only one of her family to survive in total she lost 49 relatives. It was 59 years before she spoke of her hellish experiences.“The SS drove people into the gas chambers with flamethrowers, people knew they were facing their death and tried to struggle, wailing a lot,” she said. “The dogs barked and the SS set them on the people. There were many children, so many children.”As Monday’s anniversary approaches, a burden hangs over Germany. Despite decades of “never again” campaigns and education, the last years have seen the rise of the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland and a series of high-profile anti-Semitic attacks: on Jewish schoolchildren, on young kippa-wearing men in Berlin, on a rabbi in Hamburg and more.Last October, a 27-year-old German man killed two people in the eastern city Halle while trying to gain access to the city synagogue during Yom Kippur ceremonies. Only luck and a reinforced door kept him out, sparing Germany a bloodbath.Like many other survivors, Éva Pusztai-Fahidi is ambivalent about the direction of the world ahead of Monday’s Auschwitz anniversary.“In many ways my generation, and survivors in particular, were more attuned to the dangers,” she said. “I know that as soon, anywhere, it starts with ‘dirty Jew’ it ends in a crematorium.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149978.1579857872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit european presidents sign withdrawal agreement","story":"There was mixed emotions among British MEPs as they cleared their offices in Brussels.

Speculation about his successor started immediately. Such speculation is based on the out-of-date idea that it matters who holds the job.Once upon a time, the Director-General did matter, for two reasons. The first was that he (always he, not she) exercised real editorial control, and therefore decided what was broadcast. The first Director-General, Sir John Reith, did this hence the phrase “Reithian values”. The second reason was that the BBC was so dominant in broadcasting that the person in charge of it was unassailably powerful.Whenever prime ministers got fed up with the BBC, they therefore used their right to appoint the corporation’s Chairman. The Chairman they chose would get rid of the “wrong” Director-General and put in the “right” one.Thus the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, wearied of his Left-wing former supporter, the Director-General Hugh Greene, and put in as Chairman a former Tory minister, Lord Hill, to edge him out. Thus Margaret Thatcher, furious at the BBC’s anti-Tory bias under the Director-General Alasdair Milne (father of Jeremy Corbyn’s lovable lieutenant, Seumas), made Marmaduke Hussey Chairman. In due time, Hussey appointed the highly effective moderniser John Birt as Director-General.Things are different now. The BBC is such a huge bureaucracy that no D-G can give it an editorial character. There are no “Hallian” values. Nowadays, its executives are entirely ensnared in their own processes. Look at the comical row about its rates of pay for women – for which the BBC’s only solution is spending much more licence-payers’ money.The bigger change is technological, and therefore competitive. Satellite and cable television, deregulation of radio, and then the internet and all its works have meant that you can watch or listen to British media all day, all your life, without ever having to use the BBC. Millions under the age of 40 do exactly that. But if you have any form of live terrestrial television on any device, you must pay the BBC £154.50 a year for a TV licence. If you fail to do so, you can be dragged to the magistrates’ court, where you will be fined up to £1,000. Nearly 200,000 people, most of them poor, are thus humiliated in court every year.Should the BBC TV licence fee be scrapped pollEven this scale of unjust persecution cannot prevent technological evasion, so the BBC’s revenue is starting to slide. The system looks doomed. Until quite recently, politicians were so scared of being trashed by the BBC that they dared not reform it. Indeed, the modernising project of David Cameron’s leadership was a way of getting kinder coverage from the BBC by seeming less Right-wing. Now alternative technologies, and the victory of Brexit after nearly four years of unremitting BBC opposition, have altered all that.Boris Johnson’s thumping majority has proved it is possible to win big without having to talk to the BBC on its terms. His party paid no electoral price for defying the traditional BBC invitation to come on and be humiliated. For the first time in the corporation’s century (due in 2022), it will have to get used to the feeling that the Government does not need it.How, then, should the Boris administration treat the BBC? It is being advised to avoid “trench warfare”. It is true that the soft Left will try to unite behind the proposition that the BBC is a “national treasure” which the Tories are trying to destroy. Its rhetoric is starting to equate the BBC with the NHS as a sacred cow. There might be some backlash, especially among more educated voters, against Tory “philistinism” and political interference.The danger of braking, however, is greater than that of accelerating. Big bureaucracies always try to win over their critics with soft words – the well-known phenomenon by which ministers “go native” among officials. This is already happening. Note the sudden prominence given on the BBC to the late, great Sir Roger Scruton, the Tory thinker whom, in life, it scorned.Don’t be fooled: much better to maintain the Dominic Cummings refusal to take the BBC at its own valuation. It is well worth any government’s while to harass the BBC when it lets slip its political views. As a chartered body funded by a compulsory licence fee, it has to take seriously all accusations of bias. And as a body with its own impermeable, uniform, would-be-right-on culture, it is frequently guilty as charged.Indeed, if the Left does try explicitly to turn the BBC into its fortress in the culture wars, that will only confirm what millions know already, that it has been such a fortress for decades. When I say “the Left”, I am not speaking in strictly party terms (though I am sure very few BBC high-ups vote Conservative). I mean the more generalised de haut en bas wokery which treats Greta Thunberg as Joan of Arc and the wider population as prejudiced idiots.At present, BBC News is running items under the title “Our Planet Matters”. Of course it matters. One resents the insulting implication that millions of us think it doesn’t. But in what sense is this news? Why are we forever being preached at and ticked off? The long story of the Brexit struggle has shown millions of Leave voters that the BBC despised them, and tried to deny their voice – for example, by weighting almost all panels and audiences on Question Time and Any Questions? against them. To jumble two well-known metaphors, Boris should strike while the iron has entered our souls.When Nick Robinson grilled me on the Today programme a few weeks ago, he warned me against a split society, such as that in the United States, where no media is shared by people of differing views. My answer was that such a split has already been created here – by the BBC. Of this, the Brexit story is the final proof.In terms of methods, however, it would be foolish – and wrong – for the Government to try to act like some exterior super-editor trying to “gag” the BBC. Except in egregious cases, the Government’s concern should be not particular programmes, but the system, especially the money.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisIn taking its stance, it is rightly looking at the issue from the point of view of the licence-payer. The phrase “poll tax” is an exactly correct description of the licence fee. Like all undifferentiated poll taxes, it bears heaviest on the poorest. And every year, the service has more and more free riders as the rising generation finds ways of not paying.There are two obvious steps to take. The first, already hinted at by the Government, is to decriminalise non-payment, turning it into an ordinary debt without the shame of a criminal court. The second would be to cut the licence fee substantially, say by half. Rather than trying to dictate what programmes should be cut, this would leave the decision to the BBC. For the first time, its “wider still and wider” doctrine would have to reverse. Then it would have to make up its mind what mattered, and how to keep it.I do not necessarily disagree that some things on the BBC – notably Radio 3 and 4 – are good for our culture. If they are, ways, such as subscription, can be found of paying for them.

Australia also reported its first case last night while Malaysia confirmed three cases.Speaking after Cobra, which was chaired by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Prof Witty, said: “We think there\u0027s a fair chance we may get some cases over time.“Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.“I think we should definitely see this as a marathon, not a sprint we need to have our entire response based on that principle.”The Department of Health said most people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so it was essential they knew what to do if they became ill. When asked why no physical tests were carried out on arrivals into the UK from Wuhan, before flights had stopped, Mr Whitty said: Every country does this slightly differently, that\u0027s always been the case.”He said that after a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group of Experts, it was concluded: The screening would not really provide any appreciable increase in benefit for the UK public.How the coronavirus spreadsDr Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England (PHE) said: “There are no positive cases in the UK as yet, but we will go on testing and those numbers will of course change,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think it\u0027s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one.”All the people tested in the UK are thought to have visited Wuhan and four out five patients tested in Scotland were from China, Downing Street said.Dr Cosford said anyone returning from China who experienced symptoms should avoid ‘pitching up’ at hospitals or their GP, and instead contact NHS 111.But he said that the majority of people would probably recover if they contracted the virus.The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims, while Disneyland Shanghai and parts of the Great Wall of China have been closed to visitors. Starbucks said on Friday that it would close all of its coffee shops in the Hubei province during the New Year holiday.It comes as China expanded severe travel limits to more than 18 cities, corralling at least 56 million million people in a wide-ranging quarantine as authorities desperately attempt to demonstrate that they are in control of the coronavirus ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations.All 70,000 of China’s cinemas, as well as attractions such as the Shanghai Disneyland and the Beijing stretch of the Great Wall of China, closed their doors.In Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, construction of a brand new 1,000-bed hospital - which the government pledged will be completed within a week - also began, amid concerns about a shortage of beds and equipment.Coronavirus | Total cases by countryBut the virus has continued to spread internationally, with the United States recording a second infection - this time a woman in her 60s in Chicago. Singapore has now confirmed three cases, while Nepal has identified its first and Thailand its fifth.Private school groups are advising their members to consider planning for the possibility that pupils may not be able to travel during upcoming half term holidays in mid-February.A spokesperson for The Girls\u0027 Schools Association said “We are monitoring the situation carefully and are advising schools to consider planning for the eventuality that some pupils may not be able to travel home, or may choose not to travel home, for the half term or Easter holidays”.China sends more students to UK fee-paying schools than any other nation, data shows.The World Health Organization (WHO) is still refusing to declare an international public health emergency, which some experts said is ‘surprising.’In the past, the agency has been accused of overreacting to emerging pandemics, such as its response to bird flu in 2009.Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds, said:  The proportion of severe cases appears high. My hope is that this is not a decision that we might come to regret.Peter Piot, professor of global health and director at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak is in a ‘critical phase’ in which intensified international collaboration and more resources was crucial.Comment: There’s a job-share vacant since Harry and Meghan leftComment: The folly of HS2 is a modern telling of the Seven Deadly SinsComment: Of course Trump should go - but it\u0026#39s the voters who should kick him out Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Powerful earthquake hits Turkey, killing 20 and sending panicked residents onto the streetsWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceCoronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedCoronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseHugh Laurie: Celebrities who turn down honours are \u0026#39pompous\u0026#39Donald Trump\u0026#39s US Space Force logo compared to Star Trek Starfleet Command badgeDonald Trump accused of lying about 34 US troops injured in Iran airstrikeScratch \u0026#39n\u0026#39 sniff patch to help vegans and vegetarians beat their craving for baconFraudsters in UK are \u0026#39operating with impunity\u0026#39 amid sharp rise in cases, report revealsThree children found dead at house in DublinBoris Johnson faces test of \u0026#39friends and sovereign equals\u0026#39 post-Brexit relationship with EU over fishing rightsMinister says railways are built \u0026#39for our children\u0026#39 in strongest hint yet that HS2 will go aheadComment: In the 21st century we should be able to imagine life without the BBC licence feeFewer than four per cent of offences investigated by police in crime-ridden area of London end up in courtChildren should be able to legally change gender, charity backed by Scottish Government saysGovernment advises schools that transgender boys need access to free period products We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/24/TELEMMGLPICT000222161290_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqB9TNGSg3mw1zIYGf6IZil_PnnjZCHM7buvIhfynOWKk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"need do better job showing saudi arabias new ambassador uk reveals","story":"Prince Khalid, pictured in the Saudi embassy in London, is the son of the country\u0026#39s former long-standing ambassador to the USFor someone who has endured the rigours of military training at Sandhurst, the newly-appointed Saudi ambassador to Britain has the qualities needed to mount a robust defence of his country’s interests.The experience of being an officer cadet at Sandhurst in the 1990s has certainly left an indelible mark on Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the new Saudi ambassador to London. “Anyone who has undergone any military training will tell you it can often be a trying time,” he recalls.“Whether it was hallucinating on 80 kilometre enforced marches in the Brecon Beacons, or being told your college buildings are in the wrong place and you have to spend all night moving them two metres to the right, these experiences shape you and make you who you are. They also teach you that if there is a problem there is a solution.”Since taking up his position as Saudi ambassador to London last year, Prince Khalid has had more than his fair share of problems to deal with, usually with no easy solutions on offer.He took up his position amid the controversy over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018, an outrage that has had profound consequences for Riyadh’s relations with traditional allies such as Britain.The 42-year-old, who was educated at Eton, is married to the niece of the 12th Duke of NorthumberlandAnd this week he has had to deal with the fall-out from the allegation that Saudi Arabia’s all-powerful Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, was involved in hacking the phone of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.On the Khashoggi affair, the ambassador is unequivocal in condemning the journalist’s brutal murder at the Saudi consulate, which he visited to obtain documentation so that he could marry his fiance.Speaking in his first British newspaper interview since his appointment, Prince Khaled said: “There is no question that the events in Istanbul were a stain on our society, our country and our culture.”As for the Bezos controversy, he argued it was difficult for the Saudis to defend themselves when they had not been presented with all the facts. “It is very easy for people to throw these unsubstantiated allegations against Saudi Arabia because they know that it is very difficult for Riyadh to defend itself when it does not have proper access to the details,” he explained.“We need to see the evidence before we make any response, because the evidence made public so far is  circumstantial at best.“In Saudi we do not always represent ourselves very well because we are a reticent people and our culture does not push us to talking about ourselves. We need to do a better job on showing the world who we really are.”The dynamic 42-year-old ambassador, who is directly descended from Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, has impeccable credentials for his current position, having spent much of his childhood at the Saudi embassy in Washington, where his father Prince Bandar, was his country’s long-serving ambassador.He is also well-versed in the more elite institutions of British society, having been educated at Eton and Pembroke College, Oxford before going to Sandhurst. In his bachelor days he dated the actress and model Vanessa Haydon, who later married Donald Trump Jr, and is now himself married to Lucy, the niece of the 12th Duke of Northumberland.Indeed, his ties to the British aristocracy are such that his wife’s maternal great grandmother, Lady Celia Crewe-Milnes, was actually born in the opulent mansion in London’s Curzon  Street that now houses the Saudi Embassy. Prince Khalid has decidedly mixed emotions about his privileged English upbringing.“No experience comes without highs and lows,” he recalls. “I remember arriving at boarding school in England and  being asked all kinds of questions - did I have camels? Was my life like it is in the movie in films like Coming to America?”Nevertheless he believes the experience helped him to acquire a profound understanding of Britain, a country he now regards as being his second home.“The experience of living abroad showed me that , while we may have different cultural backgrounds, as human beings we are all fundamentally the same.“My experience in the UK has given me a unique knowledge of the country. I have spent some of the formative years of my life here so I feel I know it well. I have a British wife and two half-British daughters. It is almost a second home for me.“As I result to want to bring these two countries together as I feel they should be. The Uk is one of our oldest allies in the West. One of the first countries we had dealings with following the creation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Britain.”One of his main tasks as Ambassador will be to lobby the British government to take a hard line on the Iran issue, where Riyadh is a fierce critic of the nuclear deal signed with Tehran in 2015 as it does not address other issues, such as Iran’s activities elsewhere in the Arab world.“Iran’s meddling in the region is as challenging as the nuclear programme,” he explained. “This is why we were concerned with the nuclear deal, because it did not address all the other things that Iran was doing in the region.“We do not seek conflict. We do not seek escalation. We have always been supporters of taking a firm stand against Iran. Our issue is not with the people of Iran, it is with the regime running the country.But we do not believe in appeasement. At no point in history has appeasement proved to be a successful strategy. You cannot give in to a country like Iran because they will see it as a sign of weakness.”The other important issue Prince Khalid will be dealing with during his tenure as ambassador will be to promote the dramatic changes taking place in his country as part of the wholesale economic and social reforms being undertaken by the Crown Prince known as Vision 2030.“The biggest challenge facing SA at the moment is domestic,” he said. “We have a country where we are trying to radically change the quality of life for  ordinary Saudis for the better. These are very ambitious aims. You have seen it encapsulated in the programme Vision 2030 that the Crown Prince has launched. It is a very ambitious programme, but I think we are up to it.”He is also keen to encourage a better understanding of Saudi Arabia among ordinary Britons.“There are a lot of misconceptions about Saudi Arabia. We want people to come and see Saudi Arabia for themselves, and not rely on what they have read somewhere or heard somewhere to form their opinion of the country. “There is plenty to see, and you will find a warm, generous and hospitable people there waiting to greet you.” Comment: There’s a job-share vacant since Harry and Meghan leftComment: The folly of HS2 is a modern telling of the Seven Deadly SinsComment: Of course Trump should go - but it\u0026#39s the voters who should kick him out Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Coronavirus: hunt for 2,000 travellers who flew from Wuhan to Britain in last fortnightPowerful earthquake hits Turkey, killing 20 and sending panicked residents onto the streetsWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceCoronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedCoronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseHugh Laurie: Celebrities who turn down honours are \u0026#39pompous\u0026#39Donald Trump\u0026#39s US Space Force logo compared to Star Trek Starfleet Command badgeDonald Trump accused of lying about 34 US troops injured in Iran airstrikeScratch \u0026#39n\u0026#39 sniff patch to help vegans and vegetarians beat their craving for baconFraudsters in UK are \u0026#39operating with impunity\u0026#39 amid sharp rise in cases, report revealsThree children found dead at house in DublinBoris Johnson faces test of \u0026#39friends and sovereign equals\u0026#39 post-Brexit relationship with EU over fishing rightsMinister says railways are built \u0026#39for our children\u0026#39 in strongest hint yet that HS2 will go aheadComment: In the 21st century we should be able to imagine life without the BBC licence feeFewer than four per cent of offences investigated by police in crime-ridden area of London end up in courtChildren should be able to legally change gender, charity backed by Scottish Government saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/01/23/TELEMMGLPICT000222274640_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?im","title":"totalitarian china incapable telling truth virus","story":"Openness to science has not translated into openness for ordinary citizens.Beijing has got better at managing disease, but the desire for total control still leaves it exposedThe temples will not hold their fairs, the trains and planes will not run and the new movie releases, from Leap to Chinatown Detective 3, have been cancelled. China must spend this New Year holiday racing to detect and contain a new respiratory disease, the Wuhan coronavirus, which has killed at least 26 people and scientists think has spread to several thousand.There is good news. The virus is not as deadly as SARS. In fact, it is only about 10 times as deadly as seasonal flu, meaning 98 per cent of people who get it will survive (versus 85 per cent for SARS). While this isn’t exactly wonderful, it isn’t apocalyptic either. Crucially, however, China is managing the Wuhan virus very differently from how it managed SARS in 2003.According to Peter Kellam, a virus professor at Imperial College, the most important factor in managing a pandemic is “sharing”. This is hardly an area in which Chinese authorities have traditionally excelled, but for scientific purposes, both China and international institutions appear to have learned from Beijing’s disastrous attempt to cover up SARS. Scientists across the world have been given access to data like confirmed infection rates and the virus’s genome, allowing the system to gear up quickly, developing diagnostic tests and researching potential drugs. An inspection team from the World Health Organisation visited Wuhan this week and “commended” Chinese authorities for their handling of the crisis.As so often in China, however, the boundaries of freedom are strictly drawn. Official state media outlets have kept reporting low-key, placing news of the outbreak below reports of Xi Jinping’s latest marvellous speech. For now, non-state media have had their leash loosened, but they are ever-alert as to when it shortens again. Whether it is air pollution, anti-foreign rage or product contaminations, the pattern is the same. Periods of relative openness are followed by crackdowns before the debate gets “out of hand”.In some ways, a totalitarian regime might be seen as uniquely well-suited for handling a pandemic. Quarantining a zone of some 30 million people, as China is attempting around Wuhan, has never been done elsewhere. Beijing’s desire to build a surveillance network capable of tracking every single inidual always and everywhere sounds like it might be useful in tracing infection. And Westerners are dumbfounded to hear that the city’s authorities are erecting a new hospital within a week.Human adaptation to threat is not quite so straightforward, however. The desire for total control, and the illusion of having it, can be just as dangerous as it is efficient. On Monday, President Xi issued an edict commanding officials to put “safety and health” before all other objectives. Unfortunately, when you have built a political culture on lies and censorship, it is difficult to change the habits of a lifetime by decree.There are multiple reports suggesting that Wuhan city authorities leaned heavily on local media and hospitals to stop news of a new virus from spreading in the initial stages, and information is still being tightly controlled. Scientists abroad may well have been inspecting its genome well before locals were given any comprehensive information about the disease.From here, it might seem inconceivable to think that a government can control the spread of domestic news about a major disease outbreak involving a 30-million person quarantine during the busiest travel time of the year. But Beijing is experienced in such matters. In 2008, authorities permitted a cover-up that led to 300,000 babies being poisoned by contaminated milk formula in order to avoid embarrassment ahead of hosting the Olympics. And across the country, the real 20-40 million person death toll of Mao’s great famine, just two generations ago, is still not widely known.Where cover-ups become tricky is when they hit international scrutiny. It was New Zealand that blew the whistle on the poisoned formula scandal, just as it was the international backlash that made the suppression of SARS impossible and therefore highly politically damaging to the Communist Party. Clearly, the party has learned this lesson when it comes to managing disease.Quick spread of CoronavirusDomestically, however, Chinese citizens know full well that they rarely get the full story from their media or government. It might not directly affect medical collaboration abroad, but it undermines the trust needed to manage public responses during a crisis like a pandemic. If the government tells its citizens not to travel, to report suspicious symptoms or to take protective measures, for example, its advice is more likely to be heeded if it does not have a longstanding habit of lying. And in a really deadly epidemic, living under a government that views its people’s lives as disposable could rather change the calculus over whether to go and get tested for a suspected infection.More broadly, it is difficult to change ingrained habits in a system riddled with corruption and distrust. New diseases like the Wuhan virus, as well as bird and swine flu, are known to be especially liable to emerge from food systems in which live, wild game mixes freely with concentrated populations, cooking and slaughtering. Officially, trade in wild animals, from delicious-sounding wild duck to the rather less appealing civet cats and pangolins, is strictly controlled in China.In practice, undercover reporters find live specimens of the poor creatures on sale all over the place, like the market from which the Wuhan virus is thought to have originated. I’ve seen such a sight myself in a Chinese market, though it was about seven years ago: rows of sorry-looking, panting animals in cages or live insects being snapped in half right next to raw meat being prepped for cooking.For now, Chinese media are being given relatively free rein to report on the problem. But how long will it be before they investigate too far up the chain and cross the wrong person – some senior official with an interest in the trade, for example – and the window of freedom closes?Clearly, China’s management of disease has improved enormously in the last 15 years and we are all safer for it. But openness to science has not translated into openness for ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, this capricious boundary means that a society that produced outbreaks like SARS, H7N9 and a live swine flu epidemic that is even now devastating the country’s pork industry still cannot openly debate the question: “How does this keep happening to us?”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall. Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueWe already do this fairly frugally, but I’ve been focused on making sure we’re not warmer than we need to be. So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress​, writes Olivia PetterI despair when I watch Love Island. It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Apple set to release cheaper and smaller iPhone, report saysBut Apple rejected that characterisation, suggesting that phone manufacturers had actually unified around two different ports. All iPhones have used its Lightning cable for nearly a decade, and most new Android phones use USB-C, it pointed out, claiming that this approach does work.Apple is unlikely to license its proprietary Lightning port to other phone manufacturers, meaning that any new EU rule would almost certainly mean the company would be forced to switch to a new port. That would mean Apple customers throwing away their wires and other accessories, the company claimed, which would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.Instead, Apple suggested that regulators should\u0026nbspfocus on the other end of the wire, where the charging cable plugs into the power. Unifying those ports would allow users to plug their charging cables into similar ports\u0026nbsp– in hotel rooms or\u0026nbspcafés, for instance – no matter what plug was on their phone.We do not believe there is a case for regulation given the industry is already moving to the use of\u0026nbspUSB\u0026nbspType-C through a connector or cable assembly, Apple said in its statement. This includes Apple’s\u0026nbspUSB-C\u0026nbsppower adapter which is compatible with all iPhone and\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspdevices. This approach is more affordable and convenient for consumers, enables charging for a wide range of portable electronic products, encourages people to re-use their charger and allows for innovation.The Lightning port was introduced in 2012, with the iPhone 5, as a replacement for Apple\u0027s old 30-pin connector. Since then it has been used on almost every one of Apple\u0027s portable devices, though the recent iPad Pro uses the industry standard USB-C port.Apple gave no firm indication that it would stick with the existing Lightning port in its iPhones. It has been rumoured that the company is moving towards getting rid of the charging port entirely, and recent handsets have included wireless charging that does away with the need for a wire.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen. As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he?

Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be.

Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysThe first cookie — in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) — ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I can\u0027t tell you whether it\u0027s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn\u0027t look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That\u0027s the beauty of baking in space, according to former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It\u0027s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution\u0027s National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can\u0027t be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What\u0027s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There\u0027s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They shine so intensely that they challenge traditional astrophysical models, which have been unable to account for such a bright star.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists think they have found the cause of the blazing brightness coming out of\u0026nbspSN\u0026nbsp2006gy. And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The police are only contacted if the user requests help, or does not answer their phone.If it is accidentally triggered, the alert process can be stopped by entering a code. However, there is still the risk of false requests.“The false positives, believe me, we took them into account,” said Match chief executive Mandy Ginsberg. “If someone doesn’t respond, worst case someone shows up and knocks on the door. It’s not the worst thing in the world.”Grace Millane’s killer ‘quite taken by morbidity’ says Tinder dateOther new safety features planned for Match’s suite of dating apps include photo verification and an updated in-app safety centre.A recent investigation by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations found that Match Group did not have a uniform safety policy across its apps and claimed it allowed known sexual predators to use them.The dating giant admitted at the time that it would not know if registered sexual offenders were using its platforms, as it did not collect enough personal information.“As technology evolves, we will continue to aggressively deploy new tools to eradicate bad actors,” a Match Group spokesperson said at the time.Bars and restaurants have previously offered low-tech ways of raising the alarm, including asking for a pseudonymous staff member to alert workers to dangerBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu.

The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters. Unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts, floods and land desalinisation threaten the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.In Dakar, street artists from all over the world make their markThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated: “A number of countries in Africa who already face semi-arid conditions may see a reduction in projected crop yield by up to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin 2020 and reduced revenues by as much as 90 per cent by 2100.”However, a new generation of small scale farming has emerged from women in the region. They are defying\u0026nbspwhat predominantly male farming practices\u0026nbsphave done for generations and are adapting to the climate changes.Most Senegalese\u0026nbsphave noticed changes in the weather and seasons – they talk of drought, increases in temperature and distinctly shorter rainy seasons but most do not draw the connection with global climate change.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to the climate crisis.Leigh Daynes, CEO for Y Care International, explains:\u0026nbsp“The high unemployment and poverty levels experienced by young people in this remote and rural area of Casamance have only been further exacerbated by climate change.

The petition, addressed to Mr Trudeau, reads: “Canadians wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, all the best as they seek financial independence. That goal is important because Canadian taxpayers shouldn’t have to cover the couple’s bills.”The Canadian island rallying to protect Meghan and Harry’s privacyAaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a campaign group “dedicated to lower taxes, less waste and accountable government” told The Independent there was no personal animosity aimed at the royal couple, who are living in the town of North Saanich, 20 miles north of Victoria, the largest town on Vancouver Island.“In the last two weeks I received lots of phone calls from people saying the couple were welcome here, but that they did not want to pay for them,” said Mr Wudrick.\u0026nbsp“I think in recent weeks, that feeling has become more clear. Canada is a welcoming country, but some people excited they are here are viewing them as wealthy celebrities, rather than official members of the royal family where there is a protocol.”Meghan Markle’s father accuses daughter of quitting royal family for moneyHe added: “They are coming here because they want to leave the royal family, but part of that is paying their own bills.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While having offered them a warm welcome, and even helping them avoid media scrutiny, there is a view Canadians should not pay.“I think the point is, they are either private citizens or members of the royal family,” said Bruce Welsh, 70, a former musician and radio show host in Sidney. “If they are private citizens, they should not need security guards. Either way, Canada should not be paying.”Royal family: Is Prince Harry still in the line of succession?Canadian shopkeeper who served Prince Harry glad he returned ‘home’Oprah defends Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s royal exit Meghan Markle’s father admits he lied to Prince Harry about photosMena Brash, a retired political scientist who was having coffee in the Georgia Cafe on Thursday morning, said Mr Trudeau would be required to study what laws existed.\u0026nbsp“If there’s an agreement in place, we will have to pay it. A petition will not make any difference,” she said.Michael Phillips, 73, who moved to Canada from Britain three decades ago, described himself as an arch anti-royalist. He said he thought the media should leave the couple in peace, but said Canadians should not bear the cost of that privacy.“Canadians should not pay a single cent,” he said. ‘The royal family should be disbanded and they should all be allowed to live their own lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University.

She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The measures are largely arbitrary and have been used to clamp down on dissent and inconvenient voices.\u0026nbspPussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina leaves Russia despite ban on leaving“The threat of criminal prosecution in Mr Dolgopolov’s case is very real,” said Samir Gainutdinov, a lawyer working for the Agora advocacy group. “Just mentioning Jesus in the same sentence as profanity could serve as a pretext to a charge.”\u0026nbspIt is not clear\u0026nbspexactly which part of Mr Dolgopolov’s routine provoked the complaint.\u0026nbspBaza, a publication\u0026nbspconsidered close to Russian law enforcement, blamed\u0026nbspprofane jokes involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary.\u0026nbspIn the recording of his February stand-up performance, Mr Dolgopolov\u0026nbspcertainly does mix themes of\u0026nbspGod,\u0026nbspatheism and profanity\u0026nbsp– often hilariously. But President Putin, his political system and his supporters also come in for particular ribbing. In one section, the comedian\u0026nbspsuggests Russians would walk into molten lava in their masses if “the wise leader” Putin told them.\u0026nbsp“As far as I know it was because of the religious jokes, but I don’t exclude there being another reason,” Mr Dolgopolov\u0026nbspsuggested.\u0026nbsp‘Gift for satire’: Russian humourist on law banning criticism of stateThe comedian said he was always conscious of the fact his routine touched on taboo subjects. Indirectly, authorities even made their feelings about him known – in one case, police called a venue to warn them “not to joke about Putin like that” after he had performed there. But\u0026nbspMr Dolgopolov also believed his relative obscurity was insurance against the authorities taking a more active interest.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

providing no other complaints are lodged.The doctors sudden denial comes after he confirmed to both The Sun Online and trade site World Trademark Review that he was behind the objection notice.Hours later, his family also flip-flopped over whether he was involved.His brother Ammiel, of Salford, Manchester eventually claimed it must be a mix up.Speaking from his doorstep, the told The Sun Online: Ive been in touch with my brother and he insists its not him.Dr Worcester worked as a doctor in the NHS in London from  to  and studied medicine at University College London before moving to Australia.According to the General Medical Council register, Dr Worcester is currently registered in the UK without a licence to practise.However, he registered with the Australian Medical Council in  after moving overseas with his family.The formal ‘notice of threatened opposition was filed to the UK Government’s IPO on Tuesday and could have meant Harry and Meghan would have to shell out in lawyers fees and other costs to get the right to use the name in the UK.But the trademark application can continue to go ahead after the objection notice was rescinded.The Queen has yet to decide whether they can still use the “royal” part of their name - which could be worth billions.After registering a trademark, there is a period of ‘opposition’, when anyone against its use is first allowed to make this known and has the effect of extending the time before the trademark can be used.It gives opponents the time to mount a case against its use, although they may decide not to object.The period of opposition for Harry and Meghan’s application was due to end on February , but that period is now extended until at least March .June : The couple file for the Sussex Royal brand with the Intellectual Property OfficeJanuary  : Meghan and Harry reveal they intend to step back as senior royals and become financially independentJanuary : The Queen allows the couple to step back, and they agree to pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on Frogmore CottageJanuary : A notice of threatened opposition is filed against the Sussex Royal trademarkJanuary : The Intellectual Property Office confirmed the notice was being rescinded Lee Curtis, a chartered trademark attorney and partner at specialist law firm HGF, said: “Filing a notice of threatened opposition is relatively easy and can be done online for free.“The filing of a formal notice of opposition is much more involved.“Right now, the threatened opposition delays the progress of the Sussex Royal application by at least one month, buta formal opposition is ultimately mounted, this will involve the payment of an opposition fee, the drafting of formal grounds of opposition and the filing of evidence and legal submissions in support of the opposition.“The whole opposition could take at least a year to get to a decision and is thus not an action entered into lightly with a possible costs award against the losing party.”Meghan and Harry were previously reported to have trademarked  items including pencils and socks six months ago in their bid to become financially independent.The couple agreed to drop their HRH titles and pay back the £.million spent on renovating their Frogmore Cottage home as part of the deal to quit the Royal Family. Experts predicted they could rake in millions in commercial deals while still pocketing £million a year from Prince Charles.However Charles has urged Prince Harry and Meghan Markle not to profit from their Royal titles with strict rules expected on branding.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He can now eat mash.We hope that he will be able to drink soon, with a straw to start with.He cannot use his left arm but he manages to open his left hand when we ask him to do it .In a previous GoFundMe post, the family said: We have very good news to share with you. Our little knight begins to speak.He pronounces one syllable after another, not all of them, and most of the time we have to guess what he means but its better and better. Its a wonderful progress.Bravery admitted a charge of attempted murder earlier in December at the Old Bailey in London and will be sentenced next February.After throwing the little lad from the building he approached a member of staff and said: I think Ive murdered someone, Ive just thrown someone off the balcony.When Bravery, from Ealing, West London, was arrested he told police he had travelled to the London gallery with the intention of hurting someone so he could be on the TV news that evening.He said: I wanted to be on the news, who I am and why I did it, so when it is official no-one can say anything .Bravery then said he heard voices tell him he had to hurt or kill people and wanted to prove a point to every idiot who said he didnt have mental health issues.Appearing via video link from Broadmoor Hospital at the Old Bailey, Bravery could be seen closing his eyes and speaking under his breath during the hearing.The victim, who was visiting the UK from France, was forced to spend two months in intensive care and left unable to speak or eat after the horror attack on August .His French mum and dad dubbed their son their “little knight” as they revealed previously he could only smile to communicate.CPS prosecutor Emma Jones said: This devastating and shocking incident at the Tate Modern on  August of this year changed the lives of Bravery’s young victim and his family forever.The boy was singled out by Bravery who threw him from the viewing  intending to kill him.That he survived the five storey fall was extraordinary.Eye witness accounts and CCTV footage, along with Bravery’s admissions at the time of the arrest that his actions were pre-planned, meant he had little choice but to accept responsibility for his actions.In the message to generous supporters, the family thanked everyone who has contributed to the fund.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off.

Then they heard a house master coming down the corridor and everyone rushed to get back into bed.They dropped the boy tied to the chair and he crashed to the ground below and broke his back. We never saw him again.”Nights were “absolutely fearsome”, when the lights went out and the dormitory monitor was in charge.Tom, who now lives in Plymouth and has written his le story, The Last Foundling, said: “We knew that before he went to sleep he’d want to have his bit of fun.”One day, while waiting outside the headmaster’s office aged , he overheard a staff member say his mother’s name and where she lived.He secretly kept the information to himself during his ten years in the institution and five years spent with a foster family and their daughters, Monica and Janet. After another five years in the Army, Tom finally tracked down his mother, who by that time was married to a solicitor and worked as a legal secretary in Edinburgh.He said: “I wanted to make it a surprise.

He is also said to have referenced breasts, virginity and sexuality, North Wales Live reports. The messages believed to have been sent by the principal at the £,-a-year school also apparently suggested he would visit the girls at university and asked one of them where her aposlove for your principalapos had gone. Mr Belfield had previously been dubbed Britainaposs strictest head teacher after he hit the headlines for threatening them with expulsionthey formed romantic relationships while attending the school.

In another exchange, Mr Belfield is accused of telling a pupil the boarding schoolaposs staff had been warned was a apospotential sexual threat to young boys. The principal is also said to have bragged on social media about taking first-class and staying in five-star hotels on global recruitment drives to recruit pupils, who hail from countries including China, India and Nigeria.

David Lee had been trimming the heel of a shoe in his shop when his hand suddenly got caught in the machine and he was forced to watch his severed thumb drop onto the floor. After freeing himself, he immediately started thinking about how he would be able to earn a living after the accident.He told Derbyshire Live: “Straight away, I knew how bad it was and I just worried that I wouldn’t be able to fix shoes again. I cried my eyes out when I thought about it, as I thought I was going to lose my shop.“I was more concerned about that than my thumb because this is my passion. It all happened so fast but I felt no pain at all and straight away just turned all the machines off and actually went outside for a fag, while I waited for the ambulance!” David went to King’s Mill Hospital, in Mansfield, where he was then transferred to the Pulvertaft Hand Centre, at Royal Derby Hospital where the idea was put to him that a new “thumb” could be created using one of his big toes. Hearing that there could be a chance for him to carry on his job, David instantly said he would do it. He said: “As soon as it was put to me that attaching my toe gave me a chance to carry on my job, I instantly said let’s do it. I’d never heard of a procedure like this before but I also knew that the Royal Derby Hospital had the best hand surgical team in the country.” Five days later, David underwent the -hour operation surgeons spent around  hours, which has been performed only a handful of times at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton and is only considered for patients with certain types of amputations. Miss Jill Arrowsmith, one of the two consultant hand surgeons who performed the operation, said: “This procedure is only offered to patients who have lost a lot of their thumb, usually down to close to the knuckle. “Not having any of the thumb can be very disabling, especially for those who do a manual job. This type of injury could mean that these patients are not able to remain at work, so we’re delighted to be able to provide this treatment option. “Toe-to-thumb reconstructions are quite rare but we have been really pleased with all of the outcomes these patients have achieved. There are lots of dferent ways to reconstruct thumbs but using the big toe gives the best al and cosmetic benefits, as it is the thing most like a thumb on the body.

The family is convinced this had a profound impact on his mental health. And while he always had their love and support, Michael would often keep his feelings locked away. The son of Michael and Janice and brother to Joanne, Lyndsey and Jak, Michael grew up in Pallister Park and worked as a steeplejack and was a much-loved member of a very tight-knit family.  He had a gorgeous partner, a good job, nice house and three lovely babies, said Lyndsey. Youaposre just asking questions over why it happened. Joanne, , added: We think a lot of it stemmed from prison and not attending nannaaposs funeral. I do think there should be more support for people in prison and for their rehabilitation. But Michael kept everything to himself, he was a very private person, he wasnapost on social media. He was quite self-conscious and would have been mortied by all the posts for him on social media. I donapost think he realised just how much everyone loved him. Lyndsey agreed.  He wouldnapost do anything to hurt anyone and he wouldnapost have wanted us worrying about him, she said.  We would all have been there for him but I think he just didnapost want us to know about his heartache. We will never get over it. The family believe there is still a lot of stigma around mental health issues, particularly concerning men who are most at risk of suicide Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged under  in the UK and men are more at risk than women. It is thought they may be more vulnerable because they may feel a pressure to stay strong. Michael was the adored father of Kacie, , Bailee, aged seven, and three-year-old Mason. He lived with them and his partner of  years, Jade, and the couple lived just around the corner from his mum, who he was very close to.  She has been left distraught by her sudden loss, Jade also said there were no signs that Michael was suffering. They had a brilliant Christmas with the family and had just booked a holiday to Spain.    Our Kacie absolutely worshipped him, said Jade. She broke down last night saying she misses her dad and just wants him to come home.   Bailee loved playing games with him. He is a lot like his dad. Jade and Michael got together as teenagers at Keldholme School and were together ever since. I remember we had the last dance at the school disco, said Jade. He was my first love and my last love.  The family are supporting each other and taking comfort in their treasured photos, kind messages of condolence and the sharing of memories. My mam always said Michael was the most accident prone of us all, said Joanne. She said he was never out of hospital and probably broke every bone. Lyndsey laughed as she remembered how Michael could be absentminded at times. He was so laid back and could be a little bit docile, she said. One time my mam sent him out to get fish and chips and he came back saying, aposWhat did you want again, a Gazette !apos  He was beautul, he took mamaposs eyes and we called him Mickey Blue Eyes. Michael was also the joker, they recalled. Joanne told how, after a couple of drinks, he would call himself aposAunty Michelleapos. And when his mum came back from a holiday to Mexico, Michael slathered himself in fake tan so he would still have the best tan. Jade said: He was so orange I said to him, aposIf Rudolph is ill on Christmas Eve this year, at least you can guide Santaaposs sleigh!

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A grieving mum has shared a devastating image of her daughteraposs coffin in a desperate bid for an NHS law change.Mum-of-two Angela Bain, , is campaigning to enable families to escalate their concernsthey feel their loved ones are not receiving proper care after the death of her little girl Amy Lornie. She believes hospital medics aposignoredapos her pleas and failed to diagnose the five-year-oldaposs deadly brain tumour.Amy was just four when she fell ill in April  and visited doctors with vomiting, weight loss, headaches, lethargy, clumsiness and out-of-character mood swings.However it was five months before the youngster was scheduled for an MRI on August , the mum says. Angela claims that instead of conducting the scheduled MRI, medics left Amy screaming and writhing around in agony in her hospital bed for around nine hours. She says nurses repeatedly dismissed her concerns about her daughteraposs aposdeterioratingapos condition, instead giving Amy paracetamol that aposdid nothingapos to ease her suffering. When one nurse allegedly responded to Angelaaposs plea for help by askingAmy had missed her nap time and might just be tired, the mum demanded to see a doctor. But when Angela got back to her daughteraposs bedside, she says Amyaposs body was completely limp as she had stopped breathing - and the little girl would never wake up again. Doctors and nurses got Amy breathing again and rushed her for an MRI which revealed a large brain tumour and bleed on the brain. Despite emergency surgeries to relieve the pressure on Amyaposs brain and remove the tumour, Angela says it was too late for her daughter whose brain stem was apossquashedapos during the bleed. Angela also claims doctors who removed the tumour told her that Amy would have had an % chance of surviving with cancer treatment. After weeks hoping Amy would wake up to begin chemotherapy, the family made the heartbreaking decision to take the little girl off her le support and she died days later in Angelaaposs arms. The mum believesher concerns about Amyaposs worsening condition had been listened to, her daughter would still be alive. She is now campaigning for aposAmyaposs Ruleapos to be enforced.  Angela, of Aberdeen, Scotland, said: I was back and forth finding doctors, nurses, anybody because Amy was rolling around in bed absolutely screaming in pain. I was going crazy for somebody to listen. Iaposm normally a nice person, I donapost raise my voice. But I was angry, I was shouting, I was swearing. It was so frustrating. I knew something wasnapost right. They kept saying they would give her paracetamol but that wasnapost doing anything for her pain. It was horrible watching her suffer like that. Around pm I went to the nurse and told her Amy was deteriorating right in front of my eyes and she asked meAmy was tired because sheaposd missed her nap time. Amy was five, she hadnapost had nap time for a long time. I told the nurse I needed to speak to a doctor. When I got back to Amy, her body was just floppy. Sheaposd stopped breathing. After they rushed her away I remember thinking aposwhy did no one listen to meapos. I really didnapost recognise myself that night, I was so angry. She never woke up again after she stopped breathing. The last moments that Amy was Amy were just pure pain roaring out of her. Those are my last memories of her. I feel like I canapost really remember her voice, all I can remember is her screams. The surgeons got a really really sick little girl and did their best to try to fix her but it was too late. In reality she was gone before she even got to them. Her brain stem has been completely squashed. It was flat as a pancake.  aposHappyapos little girl Amy, who was aposfull of leapos and loved to sing and dance, first fell ill in April  when she became unable to keep food down due to bouts of aposviolentapos vomiting. Over the next five months, Amy visited her GP and out of hours hospital doctors several times - always with the same symptoms of sickness, loss of appetite, tiredness, headaches, clumsiness and mood swings. At first Amy was treated for a viral infection, then a urinary tract infection, then reflux and even referred to a dietician with possible food intolerances but nothing was helping. Mum Angela and her partner Ross Lowe, , watched in despair as Amyaposs weight plummeted, going from wearing clothes for five-year-olds to those for three-year-old. Some months all Amy could stomach was a teaspoon of water every five minutes, given to her night and day by Angela and Ross just to keep the little girl hydrated enough. When her daughter took a particularly bad turn on August  - just two weeks after her fth birthday - Angela took Amy to Royal Aberdeen Childrenaposs Hospital. Angela claims hospital nurses carried out tests, raising concerns about Amyaposs problems balancing and that one of her eyes appeared to be larger than the other. The mum-of-two says Amy was scheduled to have an MRI at the hospital the next day at pm but this didnapost happen until after pm when Amy stopped breathing. Amy was then taken for emergency surgery to put a shunt in her brain to relieve some of the pressure before she could be flown to Edinburghaposs Royal Hospital for Sick Children on August . In Edinburgh, surgeons were able to remove the entire tumour from Amyaposs brain and the mass was found to be a cancerous medulloblastoma growth. The oncologist allegedly told Angela that with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Amy would have an % chance of beating the cancer completely and surviving. With newfound hope, the little girlaposs family waited for weeks for her to wake up for treatment but Amy never opened her eyes again.  Angela said: Amy was a happy little girl, everybody loved her. She was amazing. She was a natural performer and loved to sing and dance. She was obsessed with Cats the musical. She was just so full of le and then bang - she wasnapost anymore. The surgeons in Edinburgh couldnapost have done any more. When they managed to remove the whole tumour, it gave us a sense of hope. Thataposs what doctors do, they fix people. It was a huge shock to find out Amy had cancer. I knew something was really wrong for months but I never expected that. It was just unreal. It was like it wasnapost happening to me. It was like I was standing back watching somebody aposs le. But the oncologist was really hopeful. He told us Amy had an % chance of survival with treatment. She just needed to be awake for the treatment. As time went on and she wasnapost coming around, I realised there wasnapost going to be a happy ending. We know now that her brain stem was pretty much dead from the pressure of the tumour and the bleed. And the brain stem doesnapost regenerate. If she had just got to Edinburgh sooner,Aberdeen had done the MRI they scheduled,someone had listened to me when Amy was in pain, she would have survived. It all comes down to her diagnosis not being fast enough because thereaposs a complete lack of awareness of the symptoms of brain tumours in children. Itaposs not fair, she should still be here. She didnapost even get the chance to fight and she had a lot of fight to give. A medulloblastoma PNET is a malignanttumour formed from primitive or poorly developed brain cells, according to the NHS. Less than  children a year develop medulloblastoma in the UK. However, it is still the most common malignant brain tumour in children, representing % of all childhood brain tumours. They are most common in children between the ages of three and eight, and are slightly more common in boys than girls. Symptoms include: nausea and vomiting , lethargy and irritability, headaches, clumsiness, dficulty with tasks like handwriting, gradual decline in school work, changes in personality and behaviour and abnormal gait. After being informed that Amy would only live for three months without cancer treatment, her family made the heartbreaking decision to take her off le support. Amy was transferred to Rachel House Childrenaposs Hospice in Kinross where she took her last breath on September  while in her mumaposs arms. The family held a funeral on October  and Amy was buried in a white cat costume to honour her love for Cats the musical. Her tragic death has had a devastating impact on Amyaposs family with Angela still struggling to process what has happened. And Amyaposs big sister Melissa Lornie, eight, wants nothing more than to see her sibling again. Angela said: Taking Amy off le support was the hardest decision but we knew she was going to die anyway. I was lying on the bed and Amy was lying on me with her head on my chest when she took her last breath. It was really peaceful. There was no struggling. It sounded like a really contented sigh when youaposre sleepy. And then she didnapost breathe again. I think she was waiting for it to just be me and her. We hadnapost been alone for so long, there were always doctors and nurses and family but as soon as we were alone she took her last breath. To this moment, I donapost think I have fully processed whataposs happened. I know sheaposs gone because she died on me but at random points in the day it hits me again. Itaposs like I have been totally paralysed. Getting up in the mornings is hard but I have to for Melissa. When Amy died a part of me died too. Melissa is really not good, she misses her sister. None of us like being in our house anymore. Itaposs like being trapped. There are so many bad memories.

Andrea Horvathova was found unconscious at a property in Mutley, Plymouth, on the evening of Sunday March , . The hearing was told her boyfriend suggested she had taken a couple of lines of speed, a couple of lines of MDMA, and maybe ketamine, along with spiced rum. Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted the cause of death was given as sudden cardiac death brought on by her response to multiple drugs being consumed. He concluded he would record a verdict of drug related death. Police had also been called to the address after a group of people were reported to be under the influence of drink and controlled drugs, Plymouth Live reports. Andrea and another woman were both suffering the effects and raced to Derrord Hospital. The other woman survived, but Andrea died three days later on March , aged just . An inquest, presided over by senior coroner Ian Arrow noted how she had amphetamine, alcohol, Ecstasy, cocaine and a potent designer drug nicknamed Flakka in her system.

Plymouth Coroners Court heard a pathologistaposs toxicology report found Andreaaposs heart and liver had been damaged. The combination of drugs would have very likely resulted in a heart attack, the court heard. She had no physical injuries on her body. A statement from a close friend of Andreaaposs was read to the court.  She said she had known Andrea for two years and they regularly went to social events.She said Andrea, who was born in the Czech Republic, had revealed she had grown up in a care home and in June  had met a man called Alex whom she had a relationship with and had talked about going travelling with. The statement noted how Andrea and Alex had taken drugs together, but after their relationship ended Andrea began to take even more drugs, adding: she was upset by the end of the relationship. Her friend said Andrea worked in a factory and took le to the max and loved parties, saying up late, drinking and partying. She described Andrea as happy-go-lucky strong and independent woman. However, she then began another relationship with another man, who she lived with. At .pm on March  Andrea had emailed her friend askingshe could come around to visit. The pair later attended a small gathering at a house where Andrea began drinking.

In the historic Manger Square, the heir entered the Mosque of Omar, the only mosque in the Old City of Bethlehem, before signing his name in Arabic in the visitors’ book to the delight of his hosts.  A while later he made the short walk across the way, to make a personal pilgrimage to the exact spot where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born, in the crypt of the Church of the Nativity.  Charles was universally praised by religious leaders from several faiths who came together for his historic visit, saying the heir was responsible for “giving hope to all Christians”. The Prince has been a long term supporter in multi-faith dialogue and said he had always strived to bring people together.  Speaking at a reception in Bethlehem celebrating the ties between British and Palestinian people, the prince said it was his wish that “a just and lasting peace” would be established for all peoples in the region. He said: “Throughout my le, I have tried, in whatever very small way I can, to foster greater understanding between people of dferent faiths, to heal isions and to remind people of so much that we share in common as opposed to what ides us. Elsewhere in the world too, I have endeavoured to build bridges between dferent religions so that we might learn from each other and be stronger together as a result. It breaks my heart therefore that we should continue to see so much suffering and ision.  No-one arriving in Bethlehem today could miss the signs of continued hardship and the situation you face. And I can only join you, and all communities, in your prayers for a just and lasting peace. We must pursue this cause with faith and determination, striving to heal the wounds which have caused such pain. It is my dearest wish that the future will bring freedom, justice and equality to all Palestinians, enabling you to thrive and to prosper. “It is a great regret that my time here has been all too short and I pray that one day I shall be able to .”Charlesaposs words of support came as US President Donald Trump was expected to unveil his long-awaited Middle East peace plan.But the initiative, intended to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is thought to be an unfavourable one for Palestinians, with the Israelis reportedly set to receive territory gains and other concessions.  Charles is due to fly back to the UK this evening after his two day tour of the region which aides said he has enjoyed immensely. The governor of Jerusalem Kamel Hmeid  told the prince how Christians and Muslims had lived for centuries in a peaceful coexistence in Bethlehem, and recounted the story of how Omar was invited to pray inside the Church of the Holy Nativity.  He refused, saying thathe did it would become a mosque and instead he prayed outside.  The Omar mosque is named after the Caliph Omar, who conquered Jerusalem in  but guaranteed that Christians would be free to continue to worship. The message of religious co-existence was, said Charles, a wonderful example. In the afternoon, Charles held a historic meeting with Palestinian president Mahmood Abbas who thanked him and the UK for its support in support for a two state solution.  The Prince beamed as he spoke of his “great joy” at being able to visit the region, adding: “I have been looking forward to this opportunity for nearly  years, therefore visiting Bethlehem is a great joy.” Charles, , said he his visit had made him “even more aware” of the issues and challenged faced by the Palestinian people.  The prince later sampled a range of traditional Palestinian olive-based products on a visit to a convent and monastery in Bethlehem.  Visiting the Carmelite Convent and Sacred Heart Fathers Monastery, which dates back to , the heir to the throne revelled in sharing his interest for conservation with others with the same passion.  He spent over  minutes chatting to conservationist Vivien Sansour, who told him about the key place of olive trees on Palestinian heritage, cuisine and practises.

Paige Dobson, , would try and stop the skin on her chin aposcrease, pull and dimpleapos by keeping her expression neutral. But it left her looking aposconstantly miserableapos and appearing to permanently sport a aposresting b***h faceapos. But her le has been transformed after she underwent a gruelling five-and-a-half-hour operation on her jaw, which included a nose job. The op saw her jaws broken, realigned and secured in place with metal plates and screws. Speaking a year on from the surgery, Paige, from Netheravon, Wiltshire, said: Before my surgery I was so self-conscious and always avoided smiling. I hated having pictures taken and always covered half my face with my hand. Whenever I closed my mouth it would crease up andI laughed too much Iaposd be really gummy, it held me back from enjoying myself and being able to smile nicely in photos. The orthodontist said braces wouldnapost do anything because my overbite was so bad. When we looked back on pictures my mum always used to say aposPaige why have you got a resting b**** face apos She was obviously kidding, but it was from where my mouth was pulling so I constantly looked miserable. I felt it because I looked it - but now all I do is beam in photos. Paige suffered years of ridicule from cruel bullies who imitated the way she laughed and even followed her home from school, with the teen trying to hide her overbite by refusing to smile for pictures.  But since the le-changing surgery, Paige has gained so much confidence she now loves to smile - banishing her  b***h face once and for all. In addition to hating having pictures of herself taken, Paige also had to deal with bullies who mocked her appearance with cruel impersonations. Paige said: When I was  I got bullied to absolute hell. There was a group of people who would always make comments, laugh and impersonate how I would lookI was laughing, it was really cruel.  The main girl in this group got her boyfriend to follow me home from school and shout abuse at me for six months - it was so bad we had to get the police involved. After two-and-a-half years in braces, Paige underwent surgery, known as bimaxillary osteotomy, at Salisbury District Hospital in Odstock, Wiltshire, on January  . Surgeons broke Paigeaposs top and bottom jawbones and fixed her jaw in a new position with plates and screws.  Once theyaposd re-positioned her jaw, doctors realised her nose was off centre so they had to break her septum to be able to realign her nose with her jaw - effectively giving Paige a aposbonusapos nose job. The transformation was so radical that when Paigeaposs mum, -year-old hairdresser Tracey Dobson, walked into the room post-surgery she didnapost recognise her daughteraposs side profile. Paige said: I didnapost come round from the anaesthetic until pm that night.  When my parents came in the room my mum said as she walked towards me she took a step back and went to walk away because she didnapost recognise me as my side profile was already dferent. The operation hasnapost just changed my jaw itaposs changed my nose too - everything is completely dferent. Paige took six weeks off college where she was studying Performing Arts A levels to recover, and at the six-month mark had her braces removed. A year on from the op, Paige says she aposdoesnapost recogniseapos the person she sees in the mirror and feels like le has just begun.

Treorchy, in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, triumphed over better known high streets because of its commitment to the local community, an improving customer experience, an innovative approach to retail and an environmental mind set. A newly launched aposVisit Treorchyapos website has helped give local businesses a greater presence online - before this, only  per cent of businesses had a website - while a strategic partnership provides digital training and support to local entrepreneurs. A aposHop, Shop and Saveapos scheme offers businesses advertising space on local buses infor instore discounts for customers, helping to promote public transport, reduce air pollution and drive footfall to high street outlets -  per cent of which are independently owned. Treorchy also hosts year-round activities. Last year the town hosted a two-night outdoor cinema event, which was attended by  people each night, an art festival and its annual Christmas Parade. It took home a £, prize for the local community in the coveted Great British High Street Awards, in partnership with Visa. The news comes as research from Visa found  per cent of consumers said a thriving high street makes a town or village a more appealing destination. Belper Town Centre was named a aposChampion High Streetapos in England, as were High Street, Newtownards, Northern Ireland, and Main Street, Prestwick in Scotland. aposRising Star of the Yearapos, which identies the high street taking the lead to adapt and ersy, was awarded to The Square in Kelso, a market town in the Scottish Borders area.It was commended for its innovative initiatives designed to drive footfall and consumer spending on the high street. The ceremony, in Edinburgh, was attended by the High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP and representatives from  shortlisted high streets. Rt Hon Jake Berry MP said: Every place has its own unique strengths and challenges, but all our town centres and high streets have one thing in common - they are the beating heart of our communities.The Great British High Street Awards celebrate the grit and determination of local people who are dedicated to supporting their communities, growing their local economy and finding innovative solutions to modern day challenges. In Edinburgh, I saw the very best of our high streets and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of this yearaposs winners and to give my personal thanks to the iniduals and communities helping to build the future of the high street. I am delighted to see such strong examples of thriving high streets from every nation in our United Kingdom.  Jeni Mundy, managing director UK  Ireland for Visa, said: Treorchy and The Square in Kelso are fantastic examples of communities that have made huge strides in transforming their high street to signicantly improve the experience for locals and visitors alike. Their success goes to show that where you shop really does matter. For Treorchy, a rich cultural calendar combined with a desire to experiment with new ways to drive people to shop local shows how independent businesses can come together to make the high street a better place for all. Visaaposs research reveals four in five consumers say a thriving high street makes a town or village a more appealing destination, underlining why we all need to get behind our local businesses.

Saleswoman Michele Kobke says she has been in love with the -tonne jet for the past six years - even describing it as the love of her le. The -year-old German is now planning to wed the Boeing - after first locking eyes on the aircraft through the window at Berlinaposs Tegel airport. Michele says she was first attracted to the Boeingaposs wings, winglets and thrusters. But she has only managed to meet aposhimapos twice, admitting when she canapost be close to the plane she cradles its components in bed at night. But the besotted romantic has an affectionate nickname for her mechanical aposfiancéapos -  aposSchatz,apos which means aposdarlingapos. After six years of only being able to aposmeetapos the aircraft through the glass window of the airport, in September , she was finally able to get up close. In September , she was able to kiss it and even stand on one of its wings in the hangar. And now her dreams are likely to come true as her thoughts turn to marriage. Unlike a traditional wedding, Michele doesnapost want to wear a white gown and veil. Instead, she imagines wearing black trousers and a black blazer on her big day.  She has plans to meet the plane again in a hangar in Amsterdam, on March , . While her friends and family have accepted her relationship, her family are not interested in meeting Schatz and she wants her wedding to be an intimate affair. The time in the hangar was the most beautul moment of my le and when I was with him, we enjoyed our time together, we kissed and I caressed him, Michele said. The hangar is home for Schatz and me we can enjoy our time together undisturbed there. I plan to move into the hangar one day and my biggest dream is to be with Schatz and to live with him. I also want to marry him in the hangar and spend the whole night with him. I wouldnapost want to put on a white dress, but dress really smartly with black trousers and a black blazer. I want to have someone to marry us and say, aposdo you want to marry your -apos and I say, aposyesapos, we kiss and then Iaposm immortalised with him and we can be together forever. Michele has met him twice so far - both times last year. She spends time with parts of the Boeing to stay connected to aposSchatzapos while they are apart. I sleep with my darling every night, either with real components like the spoiler, flap track fairing and tank valve or five-foot-two model intimacy is part of our relationship.  Experts call this type of love affair objectophilia, where a person is attracted to an inanimate object. People with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation. Some objectophiles believe in animism and a sense of reciprocation based on the belief that objects have souls, intelligence and feelings and are able to communicate.

The Silicon Valley CEO wants a nanny, housekeeper and cook all rolled into one- and she wants them to commit the next five years to looking after her kids. Nannies applying to care for her two ten-year-olds will be required to ski, drive in foreign countries, cook vegan meals, and coordinate overseas holidays for the family. The ad called for a candidate who is CPR-certied, a strong swimmer and leguard, and is a spreadsheet whizz capable of juggling the childrenaposs lives and the housework - all the while tracking budgets and expenses. Twitter user Kimberley Harrington tweeted screenshots of the ad which quickly went viral as people were stunned at the mumaposs ambitious list of requirements.aposLook I know what day it is and where I’m posting this but I still challenge you to find ANYTHING more bananas bat sh*t than THIS. I DARE YOU,apos Harrington wrote.  The ad didnapost identy the CEO or the company she runs in San Franciscoaposs Silicon Valley.However it noted she is based in city Menlo Park, home to the headquarters of countless start-ups and tech giants including Facebook.The job description shared by the CEO included a formidable list of desired qualities. Major responsibilities are keeping the household family and staff and its processes and programs well organized, cooking organic foods that meet our allergy requirements, planning vacations, camps and after school activities, errands, and spending time with the kids,apos the job description reads.   Whoever gets the position will have to agree to a scheduleof five days a week aposapproximately .am to .pm Sunday- Thursdayor Monday-Friday apos. aposMom is a CEO and needs to relax on weekends. Weekends are busy with sports and play dates. Live-in option is the full kitchen, one-bedroom pool house.apos The ad said the CEO was looking for an intelligent multi-tasker with a university degree or equivalent, who will also need to help her children with homework and play maths games with them. An example of a maths game the nanny would be expected to play was included in the ad: aposHow much fish should we buy today for five of us apos  The nanny would also be expected to organise the familyaposs vacations, alongside budgeting and organising the housework using spreadsheet tools. aposConduct research into domestic and global vacation options based on criteria, populate information into a simple Excel spreadsheet, recommend and book vacations, track vacation expenses in Excel including track vacation home deposits getting ed.apos The nanny was also expected to organise the childrenaposs social lives and chores. The ad continued that the successful candidate should be: aposemailing and texting vendors, friends and parents in a professional manner, using Word to track kidsapos chores, plan household meetings, track allowance and household expenses, and monitor and track purchases and make s on timeapos.  The nanny will also be in charge of the household menu, which the ad made clear would be mostly vegan. aposFamily eats organic and is allergic to cow and goat dairy, chicken eggs, green beans and watermelon.apos  The job also required the worker to be a strong swimmer and be a skilled outdoors and sports person. aposCan do short mountain hikes, willing to work out together in the home gym with the mom, can ski, is CPR-certied, excellent driver, experience driving in snow, experience driving in other countries, skilled at coaching kids and has room in their heart to love the kids and the mom.apos  Twitter users reacted with disbelief to the job advert, with some calling it an impossible list of qualications. Others suggested anyone qualied to meet all her requirements deserved a six-figure salary. While another joked they thought the ad was going to end with: This is an unpaid internship.  Naima Cochrane wondered whether the perfect candidate even existed, writing: First of all, this is an actual IMPOSSIBLE list of qualications - literally impossible.

What should have been the happiest day of her le was completely ruined because she spent the day knocking back detox shakes, resulting in disaster when she gambled on a fart and lost in a big way. She ended up ruining her £, dress, but refused to let that get that stop her from having a first dance with her husband in front of their nearest and dearest. But things went from bad to worse and ended up with the couple feeding each other wedding cake with poo-stained hands. The wedding planner was first alerted to the issue when she heard the dreaded words we have an issue over her headset. She took to Reddit to share the horrying details, which she admits still make her cringe. Her post has attracted more than , comments with most users being pretty grossed out by the turn of events and others labelling her a hero and a champ. Things didnapost exactly start well, and the planner claims the bride had been quite the bridezilla from day one. She wanted the reception to take place in a historic barn at one of the family properties, which caused numerous issues.  It had no water or electricity, leaving the planner to arrange for a bank of generators, buckets of water, additional auxiliary tents - as the barn wasnapost big enough to house all the guests. After hearing what had happened the planner told guests there would be a short delay before heading to the loo to help her poor assistant, who was cleaning the bride off with toilet paper. She claims the bride had let out a substance no human body should emit. She writes: Iaposm just looking at her manicured nails. Residue of diarrhea are just embedded in her nail bed. I start trying to scrape the poo out with a fabric stain wipe.  But the bride insisted the show went on. Despite the stench that she brought out of the bathroom with her - which the groom noticed - the newlyweds took their place on the dance floor to start the choreographed number. The planner writes: As the groom spun his bride around, hand on her waist, he is squishing the poo up the insides of the waist trainer, up and out the back waistband. To our horror, we watch as a oily stain spread across the mid back of the gown. As we are still cringing from this, the groom sets his hand firmly in the middle of the poo stain.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Teenager Ibolya Knill was wearing bright red high-heeled sandals when she was rounded up by Nazi troops in surprised raids on Jewish homes in Hungary.A week later, the -year-old was to marry, and in the pocket of her carefree summer dress nestled a pair of wedding rings she had just had engraved with the date of their big day: June , . Tragically, that date was to take on a very dferent signicance.For when the morning of June  finally arrived, Ibolya – known as Iby – still wearing her red heels and by now filthy summer dress, found herself crammed “like cattle” into a wagon heading to the notorious death camp Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland.Where there should have been flutters of girlish excitement in her stomach, now there was just a heavy, gnawing sense of dread. There was no way of getting word to her fiancé, Gaspar, and there was no reasoning with the guards. “I went to them and said, ‘Today is supposed to be my wedding day’,” she recalls. “They said it made no dference. I didn’t talk of [Gaspar] again. There were a group of us in the wagon who decided to stick together. But we also decided to talk of nothing from the past, not our families or friends. It was our way of coping. I didn’t tell them.” Monday marks the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops. Iby, now , remains bright and resilient as she reflects on the devastating turn her le took. Originally from Bratislava, in what was then Czechoslovakia, she was born to a Jewish mother. After the Nazis invaded, she was smuggled to Hungary, where she lived with non-Jewish family of her father, carrying  documents that stated she was not a Jew. But in March , the Nazis also invaded Hungary. Iby was at the house of a Jewish friend that was raided, and she did not have her fake papers on her. Even with them she would have been in a precarious position, as she had been arrested and interrogated over her involvement in the resistance. She was also frightened of being caught out as an illegal immigrant. She confided these worries in a man she had recently met, Gaspar. He proposed, in the hope Hungarian citizenship would keep her safe.  Iby recalls: “We had only known each other for a matter of days, but I think he fell in love with me. “Under the circumstances, that was enough. People didn’t know what was going to happen to them, and le moved quickly. “He gave me money to buy the wedding rings and to get them engraved.” She would never see Gaspar, or those rings, again. Before she got on the transport to Auschwitz they were stripped from her, along with her earrings. The conditions of her five-day transport were appalling, and by the time she arrived at Auschwitz, exhausted and terried, Iby had every reason to feel utterly crushed. But instead, anger surged. Pushed onto the railway  of the death camp, she linked arms with friends she made during the journey.  Scared and starving though she was, Iby – in her defiant red heels – burst into the Hungarian national anthem, leading the group in song as they walked towards the camp’s notorious Angel of Death, Dr Josef Mengele. This was the man responsible for deciding which of the frailest new arrivals to send straight to the gas chambers. Her act of courage protected her and her new friends. She says: “We didn’t think we had anything to lose, and had been told to look livelywe wanted to live. Mengele laughed – he thought it was funny. I remember him – a very smart chap, with two dogs and two women in unorm behind him. He just waved us on through the gate. I was so angry. And that anger stayed with me. It helped me survive.” After her brush with Mengele, she was pushed into a “huge room”. “They stripped me of everything but my high heels – prisoners kept their shoes – they looked absolutely crazy.”  She is able to laugh a little, despite the horror of the memory. “Prisoners in striped pyjamas came and cut the hair all over our bodies. “We were pushed into showers and dressed in rags.” Iby was not tattooed with a registration number, because the tattooists ran out of ink. She has since found it out:  it remains ingrained in her mind. She was marched to Birkenau, the largest of the sub-camps within Auschwitz, where prisoners were crammed  to a hut. Chillingly, “There was no trees, grass or birdsong,” she recalls. Iby, who now lives in Leeds, West Yorks, has never ed to Auschwitz – and has no desire to ever go back. “I’m told it’s still the same, the atmosphere has stayed the same,” she says. They lived in just two rooms - one containing buckets for toilets and another to sleep in.  “The only way was to lie like spoons, heads on hips,” she says. “You had to fight your way outyou needed to get to the buckets in the night. But you wouldn’t be able to get back in. You’d have to sleep standing by the wall.” The prisoners called the green-flecked soup they were served from buckets ‘grass food’. “But the thirst was worse than the hunger,” she recalls. The only way she and the others knew which day it was, she says, was because once a week they were taken to be showered. The showers were in the same location as the notorious gas chambers – and Iby had no way of knowing to which they would be taken. Worst of all, she explains, was the smell that pervaded the camp. “The whole place smelt of burning flesh,” she says adding that she cannot attend a barbecue to this day.  She had no idea what had happened to her family, until one day a prisoner emptying the buckets told her that her mother was in Auschwitz, and searching for her. They never saw each other in the amp, but were reunited after the war. Later, Iby found out her father had been in Auschwitz, too. “But he was gassed – the very last time the gas chambers were used.” Iby herself left the death camp after “ days and  nights” – still wearing her red heels, with her rebellious spirit burning bright. Pretending to be a nurse, she volunteered for a slave labour transport to another camp, in the hope it would be better. As she waited to be loaded onto a wagon, a teenage girl approached. Iby recalls: “She was a twin. She and her sister and watched their parents go to the gas chambers, and were being experimented on by Josef Mengele. They knew that after that they would die. “She asked me,I survived, to tell the story of Auschwitz. I promised I would.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lunar new year what being","story":"NewsLunar New Year: What does being born in the Year of the Rat says about you Chinese New Year superstitions say that those born in dferent years of the countrys zodiac have dferent characteristics, so what does this mean for those born in the Year of the Rat ShareCommentsByDave Stubbings:,  JAN News\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Not only are the animals battling to survive the impact of climate change, which is melting the ice they need to hunt on, but trophy hunters and a soaring demand for their skins in China are speeding their extinction Awarding-winning wildle photographer and conservationist Ole Liodden, who has spent four years working on a project to highlight their plight, also told how hunters target the healthiest, strongest males, which leaves only the weakest iniduals to pass on their genes. He warned: “We have to stop trophy hunting and the commercial skin trade. “It is the only way polar bears have a chance of survival.” Nearly , polar bears were killed by hunters in the Arctic between  and , the most recent figures available. More than , polar bears have been killed since  – twice as many as today’s remaining population. The figures, much higher than previous estimates, were only brought to light after the Norwegian’s lawyers forced the Canadian government to release them under Freedom of Information laws. Explaining the allure of the species, he told the Mirror: “The polar bear is one of the most exclusive species for trophy hunters to pursue. But it is the mammal species least suitable because of low cub survival, low reproduction rate, and climate change.  “Although a warmer climate may largely determine the future distribution of polar bears, the vast majority of population reductions over the past  years are attributable to unsustainable hunting.” Polar bear trophy hunting started in Alaska, USA, and Svalbard, Norway, in the s, with only a few killed. But the expeditions attracted wealthy clients, who fuelled an industry that soon used planes, helicopters and ships to pursue the bears.Russia banned polar bear hunting in , followed by the USA in  and Norway a year later.  Canada’s Arctic region is now the only place in the world where hunting polar bears is still legal. Liodden says Inuit leaders are against trophy hunting but that the Canadian government encourages them to act as guides for it. Skins can fetch up to £,. Last summer a Daily Mirror investigation uncovered a host of firms offering hunts in the Arctic Circle marketed as “the most memorable” trophy collectors would ever find. For £, the -day hunts include the services of a taxidermist.  The companies proudly boast “% success rates”. There are ,-, polar bears left in the wild, according to the World Wildle Fund. But that number could be cut by two thirds by mid-centurythe Arctic continues to warm, and they are “vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List. The Mirror is campaigning for a ban on the cruel trophy industry.

I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that. I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Here, she explains the basics...So, how does it work The basic principal is that the moon has a pulling effect on all water. This includes the sap in plants, which rises during the ascending moon and falls towards the roots when it descends.When the sap rises, its a good time to sow seeds when it descends, its time to do work that involves the plants root system, such as planting seedlings, thinning them out and propagating by ision or layering.Lunar gardening tracks the .-day sidereal path of the moon, which is its journey around the zodiac in relation to the constellations, not the path which consists of one complete cycle of the moons phases, such as from one new moon to the next.How do you work out which phase youre in The easiest way for newcomers to lunar gardening is to download an app such as Moon  Garden , which gives details of the lunar calendar and shows you what you should be planting and the jobs you should be doing at any particular time.Where do signs of the zodiac come in Each sign of the zodiac belongs to a particular element - Air, Earth, Fire or Water. The theory behind lunar gardening is that as the moon moves through each sign, it transmits the energy of that element to the earth.Whether youre digging the soil, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, weeding, hoeing or pruning, always do it when the moon is in the appropriate element for the type of plant youre tending.Fire plants These are plants grown for their fruits or seeds, including soft fruits such as strawberries, stone fruits like apricots and top fruits such as apples and pears, as well as tomatoes, cucumbers, chillies, peppers and beans.Earth plants These are grown for their roots and include carrots, parsnips, potatoes and onions.Air plants These are plants grown for their flowers, such as geraniums, violets and roses, as well as flowering bulbs and rhizomes. In the vegetable garden air plants include broccoli and artichokes, because their heads are flower buds.Water plants These are all grown for their leaves. Lettuces, cabbages, leeks and leafy herbs are in this category.The idea is to only work on plants that belong to a particular element, or the soil in which the plants will be grown, when the moon is in that element. So,youre just tidying up your greenhouse to prepare to plant out tomato seedlings, do it on a Fire day.When should I harvest Harvest Fire element plants on Fire days, preferably when the moon is ascending, but not on Air days. Harvest root plants on Earth days but not on Water days. Air element plants should be harvested on Air days but not on Fire days, and Water plants are best harvested on Fire or Air days.The moons influence regulates the amount of moisture in the plants, so storing them at the wrong time can mean they will be either too dry when you eat them, or too wet when you store them. Make sure you check on the correct lunar phase for the best result.Are there any times I should avoid gardening Dont do any gardening at least six hours either side of a new or full moon, and at least  hours either side of an eclipse, because the moons energy is too strong and may adversely affect the plants and the soil.Moonpower by Jane Struthers is published by Eddison Books, priced pound..

ScotWind Leasing will present Scotland as an attractive destination for the signicant investment needed to deliver the scale of offshore wind projects we want to see.’Employment was on the agenda at Campbeltown Community Council’s meeting last week.Chairman Alan Baker said: ‘We discussed the unemployment in the area due to ious redundancies that were issued, namely at Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind.‘It was felt that after the initial meeting at the MACC premises that nothing further has been forthcoming.‘There is also to be a meeting in March with Fergus Ewing MSP to discuss further action.’The Courier asked both Mr Ewing’s office and the press office at the Scottish Government but no one could confirm the meeting was taking place, or when, by the time we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"former-depute-lord-lieutenant-receives-telegram-queen-diamond-wedding","story":"Marlene, , and Stan, , married in  and have four children together ndash now aged between  and .

At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness. But the seat, the box and most of all the stories, stopped Jessicarsquos nana from melting."},{"url":null,"title":"bypass-old-craighall-sheriffhall-shuts-two-nights","story":"Maintenance workwill take place on the A eastbound carriageway from Wednesday until Friday next week , betweenpm and ameach night.To allow the workto take place, there will be a full closure of the A eastbound carriageway between Sherfhall and Old Craighall.

interested to know your garden could perform betteryou plan your gardening schedule according to the path of the moon, through the zodiac each month.So says astrologer Jane Struthers, whose latest book Moonpower offers an introduction to lunar gardening. Here, she explains the basics...So, how does it work The basic principal is that the moon has a pulling effect on all water. This includes the sap in plants, which rises during the ascending moon and falls towards the roots when it descends.When the sap rises, its a good time to sow seeds when it descends, its time to do work that involves the plants root system, such as planting seedlings, thinning them out and propagating by ision or layering.Lunar gardening tracks the .-day sidereal path of the moon, which is its journey around the zodiac in relation to the constellations, not the path which consists of one complete cycle of the moons phases, such as from one new moon to the next.How do you work out which phase youre in The easiest way for newcomers to lunar gardening is to download an app such as Moon  Garden , which gives details of the lunar calendar and shows you what you should be planting and the jobs you should be doing at any particular time.Where do signs of the zodiac come in Each sign of the zodiac belongs to a particular element - Air, Earth, Fire or Water. The theory behind lunar gardening is that as the moon moves through each sign, it transmits the energy of that element to the earth.Whether youre digging the soil, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, weeding, hoeing or pruning, always do it when the moon is in the appropriate element for the type of plant youre tending.Fire plants These are plants grown for their fruits or seeds, including soft fruits such as strawberries, stone fruits like apricots and top fruits such as apples and pears, as well as tomatoes, cucumbers, chillies, peppers and beans.Earth plants These are grown for their roots and include carrots, parsnips, potatoes and onions.Air plants These are plants grown for their flowers, such as geraniums, violets and roses, as well as flowering bulbs and rhizomes. In the vegetable garden air plants include broccoli and artichokes, because their heads are flower buds.Water plants These are all grown for their leaves. Lettuces, cabbages, leeks and leafy herbs are in this category.The idea is to only work on plants that belong to a particular element, or the soil in which the plants will be grown, when the moon is in that element. So,youre just tidying up your greenhouse to prepare to plant out tomato seedlings, do it on a Fire day.When should I harvest Harvest Fire element plants on Fire days, preferably when the moon is ascending, but not on Air days. Harvest root plants on Earth days but not on Water days. Air element plants should be harvested on Air days but not on Fire days, and Water plants are best harvested on Fire or Air days.The moons influence regulates the amount of moisture in the plants, so storing them at the wrong time can mean they will be either too dry when you eat them, or too wet when you store them. Make sure you check on the correct lunar phase for the best result.Are there any times I should avoid gardening Dont do any gardening at least six hours either side of a new or full moon, and at least  hours either side of an eclipse, because the moons energy is too strong and may adversely affect the plants and the soil.Moonpower by Jane Struthers is published by Eddison Books, priced pound..

And it ainrsquot pretty. In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course. But such isiveness also works as the ultimate distraction technique, stealing our focus away from the deliberate running down of public services, the re-writing of the social contract.And so far itrsquos working a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Scotland could rejoin the EU  but would it want to ","story":"But fear not, because Nicola Sturgeon says we can rejoin whenever we want.

But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back.

Protecting and restoring those that remain should be an urgent priority.ldquoAt the same time, we need to encourage both professional and amateur gardeners to use the peat-free products which are readily available. Ending extraction in the UK without tackling demand for peat-based compost will only lead to further damage to peatlands in other parts of Europe.Scottish Natural Heritage video highlighting some of themethods they have used to restore peatlands in Scotland.The CCC calling for major and urgent changes to how land is managed to help the UK reach its legal target to cut emissions to net zero by  said there should be a ban on \"damaging practices rotational burning on peatland and peat extraction\".And it suggests there should be an \"obligation\" for water companies and on landowners in areas of sites of special scientic interest to restore peatland on land they own.The CCC also suggests fth of agricultural land needs to be taken out of production and freed up for natural methods of storing carbon such as more woodlands and trees, the first in-depth report on land use from the committee urges.Encouraging people to cut the beef, lamb and dairy they eat by a fth - which the committee said was a \"modest\" reduction within Government health guidelines - will help cut greenhouse gases and free up land for storing carbon.Around , hectares or  million trees a year need to be planted from  up to mid-century, a signicant increase on todays levels of planting, which were around , hectares last year.A system similar to the subsidies which have boosted renewable energy in recent years, with auctions for contracts for planting and guaranteed long-term payments for land managers, could deliver the required increase.An alternative method would be a carbon trading scheme, and either policy could be paid for by greenhouse gas-emitting industries such as fossil fuel providers or airlines, the report suggests.Public money should also go to creating and managing woodlands, planting trees and boosting hedgerows which deliver other benefits such as flood prevention and wildle habitat.All the changes outlined in the report would cost around pound. billion a year in private and public funding up to , but would deliver pound billion in annual benefits, the committee said.Some % of the UKs total greenhouse gas emissions came from the way land is used in the country in , but with the right support for farmers and land managers, that could be cut by almost two thirds by , it said.The report is being published as land management policies are undergoing a huge shake-up as the UK quits the EU subsidy regime and, in England, shts towards payments for \"public goods\".Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, said: \"Changing the way we use our land is critical to delivering the UKs net zero target.\"The options we are proposing would see farmers and land managers - the stewards of the land - delivering actions to reduce emissions.\"Doing so can provide new revenue opportunities for farmers, better air quality and improved bioersity, and more green spaces for us all to enjoy.\"But he said the changes could not be delivered in the normal course of business, and warned: \"We are in a race against time, theres no doubt urgency must be the hallmark of what we are doing here.\"Achieving emissions reductions should not be at the expense of producing less food in the UK and increasing imports, the report said.Committee chief executive Chris Stark said British beef and lamb has some of the lowest rates of emissions in the world but greenhouse gases from livestock still needed to be cut.He said it was a question of eating \"a little less meat, but when you eat it, you should know you can go for high-quality produce in the UK and know it has lower greenhouse gas emissions than imports\".Measures to sht diets could include increasing plant-based options, better labelling and,needed, subsidies and taxes to encourage lower carbon eating, the report said.A Government spokesman said ministers would consider the reports recommendations closely, and added: \"Tackling climate change and the impact on our environment is both a national and international priority, and the UK is already leading the fight against it by delivering on our world-leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by .\"Thats why were reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"island-group-calls-ferry-procurement-shake-up-amid-losses","story":"A day after the disastrous project to build two new ferries at the Ferguson yard in Inverclyde was laid bare in a Holyrood inquiry, the Arran Ferry Action Group said decisions on ferry procurement must be based on cold commercial logic ndash not politically motivation.Its intervention comes in the week the Scottish Parliament heard that the two dual-fuelled ferries being built at the now-nationalised Ferguson remain ldquosignicantly less than half-built.The Arran Ferry Action Group, which has , supporters on the island, called for Transport Scotland, ferry infrastructure body Caledonian Maritime Assetsand operator CalMac to adopt a new approach to vessel ordering, stating that Scotland should look overseas for examples of best practice.It said attention should be paid to the views of island communities and maritime experts such as Alf Baird and Roy Pedersen.The group said: ldquoThe need to build new ships should not be confused with the wish to preserve shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde or, as in the case of Ardrossan harbour, the regeneration of a small town.ldquoSubsuming one aim to another or conflating the two, as in the case of Ferguson Marine, will only result in the failure of both.The Arran group also offered its view on the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to nationalise Ferguson to deliver the vessels, and the future award of contracts for new ferries.It is now expected that the cost of building the vessels will be more than double the pound million specied in the original contract."},{"url":null,"title":"eve-livingston-rise-employment-may-not-cause-celebration","story":"This is the logic employed by governments the world over when it comes to work and unemployment, particularly those like the UK, run by right-leaning parties ndash and never more so than when the Office for National Statisticsrelease the latest round of employment figures, as they did this week.In the UK, employment is at a record high, rising at a similar rate in Scotland, with . per cent and . per cent respectively of working-age adults in work between September and November . The rise follows similar increases in previous reports. Politicians celebrate, a new data point is plotted on a graph, workers keep on slogging and the country moves on, apparently more buoyant and prosperous than it was three months ago.But behind such figures is a truth that is becomingly increasingly hard to ignore: that the measures of old mean little in todayrsquos unequal, poverty-marred society where work no longer pays and jobs for le are few and far between. We might be going out to work of a morning, but it no longer follows that wersquore paid enough to live on, that our work is secure and dignied, or that wersquoll still be going to the same job next week, month or year. Rises in employment are little cause for celebrationthey donrsquot take account of the kind of employment they measure.Take, for example, the most recent ONS statistics on zero-hours contracts, which show , people in Britain employed with no guarantee of any work at all. These figures show an epidemic when compared to the , people on such contracts in . What they donrsquot show is the impact that such insecurity and precarity has on someonersquos le: shts cancelled with an hourrsquos notice no way to plan ahead financially in direct competition with colleagues for work, and little possibility of taking on a second job when yoursquore permanently at the whim of your first one. The top-line success of Britainrsquos employment figures includes these people.It also includes, when you dig deeper, a record increase in women working full-time, thought to be driving the overall growth. With feminists having long decried the low-paid, part-time work women find themselves locked in, and the undervaluing of domestic work and care, you might expect this to be welcome. But within the rise are the nearly four million so-called Waspi women affected by changes to the state pension age which mean they will have to work until  instead of . According to the campaign, many report struggling to continue in their previous jobs due to health issues ndash in many cases, caused by the dficult work theyrsquove undertaken for more than  years.And crammed into this figure alongside them is a fall in the number of working-age women out of work to care for children and relatives. Many of those young children and sick relatives havenrsquot gone anywhere instead, women across the country have chosen between this low or unpaid care work and a job that just about covers the costs of paying someone  to do it. Not to mention that analysis by the Fawcett Society suggests that many of these full-time employed women will effectively stop earning in mid-November thanks to the countryrsquos enduring pay gap.In Scotland, the rise appears to have been driven by men gaining work. But a similar increase has also occurred in the nationrsquos levels of in-work poverty, with  per cent of those in poverty also in employment, a figure that has continuously increased since . Low wages, insecure contracts and unscrupulous practices have conspired in Scotland just as where to create a situation where social security may be more lucrative than employment, and where the person who sells you ingredients for your dinner may well be reliant on a food bank for their own.Such blunt figures on employment clearly donrsquot tell us the whole, important, story about work in Scotland and the UK. But even by their own standards, they may not be entirely accurate. In October last year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentreleased research suggesting the UKrsquos real unemployment figure may be around three million higher, with ldquohidden unemployment ndash those who report themselves economically inactive for reasons such as health, caring or early retirement ndash re across the country. The OECDrsquos assessment serves to show how the cold, hard statistics to which we attach so much weight can easily become just as subjective as political spin.And while the uncomfortable reality of the UKrsquos employment landscape presents a compelling case for dropping our hero worship of black-and-white statistics, itrsquos only one example. Just as governments like that of Scotland and New Zealand have made the case for GDP being a blunt measure when it comes to quality of le, the oversimplied metrics we use to assess the likes of productivity, educational attainment and crime can preclude us from engaging with a range of dferent experiences and interpretations.We will always need data when done well and using the right metrics it can uncover, illuminate and emphasise a range of dferent aspects of our society. But we will also always need a critical eye with which to view it, and a genuine interest in the people and stories behind the numbers. Out of context, statistics are nothing more than pixels on a screen or ink on paper.If we were to devote the same energy to improving the landscape of work across the UK as we do to celebrating largely meaningless statistics, many of these problems could be addressed. But it would require stronger legislation on insecure contracts and poverty wages, and the creation of high-quality, long-term and unionised jobs. It would require restoring the power that has been ripped from the trade union movement and rebalancing the relationships between workers and bosses.

One time, it was because I caused a scene over a stolen jacket, but usually, it was because I was drunk and being a bit of an ****. One thing I can say, though, is that Irsquove never been thrown out of a nightclub because of my beliefs.But this is what appears to have happened at the Polo Lounge in Glasgow. The Polo is a LGBT venue in the centre of town, and according to a video on social media, a woman was kicked out of the club recently for wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo ldquoLGB Alliance. Some people are said to have complained the T-shirt was anti-trans and the woman was told to turn it inside-out or she would have to leave.The womanrsquos reaction to the situation was pretty much the reaction of everyone whorsquos ever been kicked out of a club: it wasnrsquot me. ldquoIrsquove just been removed, she said, ldquobecause trans people, who I didnrsquot even see, said I was threatening to them... Donrsquot I have the right to support lesbians, gays and bisexuals  Trans people, she went on, had the power to have her kicked out because they didnrsquot like an acronym on a T-shirt.:We must fight against the rolling back of trans rightsI realise the street outside a nightclub in the early hours of the morning is not the best place for nuance, but I wish we had more subtlety in this debate. My sympathy ndash instinctively and empirically ndash is with the nightclub I am a supporter of the right of trans people to identy their gender and to have all the rights of that gender. But I also dislike the idea of people who do not agree with a particular view being excluded from a public place.That said, I understand why many LGBT people dislike the LGB Alliance. Take their horrible website for a start. Therersquos nothing critics of trans reform seem to love more than pictures of trans women who do not ldquopass as women, which may explain why the LGB Alliance website is full of pictures of beautul, thin people and women who conform to traditional feminine images ndash they ldquolook like women in other words.Therersquos an unpleasant air of supremacy about the pictures and they make me deeply uncomfortable.Some of the language on the site is also worrying. I was speaking to Michael Cashman, the co-founder of Stonewall, the other day, and, although we didnrsquot talk about the Glasgow case specically, what he said on trans rights was interesting. Young peoplersquos attitudes to gender are in advance of older peoplersquos, he said, but he also believes some of the ways in which trans people have been portrayed are similar to the way gay men used to be portrayed ndash as a threat to children for example. ldquoDangerous to children is a phrase that appears on the LGB website, along with multiple uses of the word ldquothreat. We have been here before.The fact that some gay people have signed up to the LGB Alliance does not change its flaws.They do not explain, for instance, in what way the right to self-identication is a ldquomortal threat to gay rights. They also do not appear to acknowledge that legislating for equality involves a balancing of rights and risks. And they certainly do not explain on whose authority they seek to remove the T from LGBT. They do not have that right.: Scotland can learn lessons from Canada on trans best practiceIrsquom not saying their views are extreme ndash far from it, opposition to trans equality is not an unusual opinion, which is why we should take a nuanced view of the woman who was thrown out of Polo.What she was doing was insensitive and many people will have found her shirt offensive and unpleasant, but in Britain you are allowed to be insensitive, offensive and unpleasantyou want to be.My advice to the woman, had she asked me, would have been to get over herself and not to go to a gay bar wearing that shirt, because why would you want to upset people in a place where they feel safe But my advice to the club would have been to let her stay. Anyone who goes to a gay bar and claims therersquos no T in LGBT is being insensitive and provocative, but the gay bar can be better.It can say: we are a liberal, mature and progressive place we are tolerant and we tolerate even you."},{"url":null,"title":"1917-succession-hand-glasgow-economy-12-5m-boost","story":"Glasgow Film Officesaid big-budget Hollywood films including oscar-nominated  - co-written by Glasgow-born Krysty Wilson-Cairns - and award-winning tv dramas such as Succession - which features Scottish actor Brian Cox - setting up filming in the city ldquogenerated signicant economic activity.:Lets have letime bans for gobby cinema and theatre goersIt comes as Glasgow is set to take a starring role as Gotham City in the latest Batman adaptation starring Robert Pattinson.Council leader Susan Aitken said: ldquoThese latest figures point to the continuing attraction of Glasgow as a location for film production and, crucially, the successes of the councilrsquos Film Office in facilitating that.ldquoMajor productions like  and Succession not only generate signicant economy activity within the city but they profile what Glasgow has to offer to the film and broadcast industry, from our locations to our crews and facilities.:Glasgow screenwriter given Oscar nodShe added: ldquoThis approach has been so successful that I am sure we can look forward to hearing some super news about more major productions coming to Glasgow in the very near future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10941551.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jeanie-smoking-cigarette-love-loss","story":"Maybe wersquod have gone out for a meal or gone to the movies. You loved the movies. You werenrsquot fussy. At some point Irsquod have kissed you and told you I loved you, like I did every other day.But not this birthday. Not this year. For the first time since  I wonrsquot be able to do any of that.Ah, Jeanie.My we Jean died on October  last year at .am in Strathcarron Hospice. Outside, birds were singing.Shersquod been in the hospice for a couple of days. On the Thursday it had reached the point where I was no longer able to look after her properly at home.I had spent the Friday night trying to sleep in a chair beside her bed. Every so often Irsquod lean over and talk to her as she slept, letting her know I was there. Or so I hoped. The voice gets through, one of the hospice nurses had told me.Just after eight her breathing changed. It began to slow and slow as I held her hand and cried. And then it stopped.Such a strangely peaceful thing, I remember thinking in between the tears. Nothing traumatic. Just a sht into stillness.An ending, one that had been waiting for us since she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in .Shards of memory from that morning keep coming back to me. They still cut me open. The face of the nurse I spoke to earlier that morning as the enormity of what was ahead of me was finally sinking in the same nurse who came through the door  minutes later when Jean stopped breathing. The drive down the hill to Denny knowing that I had to tell Jeanrsquos mother and sisters, our daughters, what had happened.And then the drive back. The final moments we spent with her, all the words we didnrsquot get to sayunspoken.I am writing this three-and-a-half months later. No time at all. An eternity.Most mornings I reach across the bed to where she should be, where she isnrsquot. I go through each day knowing that the person I have loved most in this world is no longer in it.I want to hear her say my name one last time. I have been trying to remember the last time she did. Somewhere in the couple of weeks before she died, I guess, before illness took language away from her. A last time that I didnrsquot realise would be the last.The thing I struggle to get my head around is the way she is somehow everywhere and nowhere now. Every road I drive down, every song I hear on the radio, she is in them. Everything is a trigger, everything points to once-insignicant memories now charged and potent, small moments from the past suddenly weighed down with an impossible weight of loss and longing.I have nothing original or unique to say about grief. Irsquom sorry. No eloquence, no insight. Mostly itrsquos a drudge illuminated by spikes of pain.The truth is, I suspect Irsquom still only in the foothills anyway. I cry most days. Sometimes I prompt it deliberately bring her to mind in a way I know will hurt, like sticking a needle into an open wound, just to remind myself that Irsquom feeling something.Other times I try to distract myself. Football on the radio, bad movies on the telly, books that seem a safe distance from her memory.But griefrsquos a sneaky f***er. Last week I was reading a passage in a book about starfish. My subconscious made the connection for me. From starfish I thought of the word seahorse and suddenly I remembered Jeaniersquos tattoo, little black ribbons and bars of ink in the shape of a cartoon-cute seahorse.And, in the same moment, I realised that I hadnrsquot thought about it since she died. How was that even possible  Was it on her left arm or her right arm  Suddenly I wasnrsquot sure. was the cruellest year. On the last day of  we were told we had run out of treatments. In May we were told Jeanie had, at best, a few months. Before we left, I remember, her oncologist gave her a hug.How did we get through the rest of that day  Itrsquos a blank to me now.Weeks passed. Irsquod repeat my mantra to her most days. ldquoYoursquore okay today, so things are okay. I was in a state of deep denial. Jeanie knew better.By July and August it was clear that her illness was beginning to have a real impact. She began to lose memory and speech. It seemed a final cruel punishment for someone so articulate, so engaged with the world. The last weeks were marked by her slow withdrawal from all of us, a withdrawal that became final on that October morning.Three-and-a-half months ago. No time at all. An eternity.ldquoNo tenses any more, the poet Denise Riley writes in Time Lived, Without its Flow, her essay about grief in the wake of the sudden death of her son. ldquoHis sudden death has dropped like a guillotine blade to slice through my old expectation that my days would stream onwards into my coming le. Instead, I continue to sense my daily le as paper-thin. As it is. But this cut through any usual feeling of chronology leaves a great blankness ahead.No tenses any more. In truth, we both had been living in a continuous present for years, ever since Jean was first diagnosed. The first mention of the word cancer cut away the notion of a future.She was diagnosed in the autumn. ldquoIrsquoll not see Christmas, she told me then. We saw another . But even so the future, or the idea of it at least, had been taken from us, even as we grew older and watched our kids grow up.Worse, the past had been taken from us as well. It was too painful for her to think about. Even everyday intimacies and nothing-special moments were out of bounds. We had the present and nothing . And now I donrsquot even have that. I am already living in that great blankness that Riley talks about.That said, maybe I have the past again. I can revisit it. And I do.Most days I find myself fantasising about going back in time, inserting myself into a moment we once shared. It doesnrsquot have to be anything special. Just as long as we are together, where I can hear her voice, where I can see her face, where I can touch her arm, her cheek, know that she is there with me. Given the choice right now, I would live forever in that moment. Reliving it again and again.In some ways I already am. Just before Christmas I had our wedding video transferred to DVD so I could watch it. I donrsquot think I had ever watched it before,Irsquom honest. Now I canrsquot stop.Itrsquos not really a wedding video, just some footage my friend Mark filmed that day back in . Watching it again took me back to our old flat in Bruce Street, Stirling. There are our two cats, my sister-in-law looking impossibly young, my dad, Jeaniersquos dad, now no longer with us. And here are friends who have drted out of our lives.But, really, when I watch it, Irsquom only watching Jeanie. She would have been  when it was filmed. God, she looks beautul. She had her make-up done professionally that morning and she hated it. And yet on video itrsquos clear how great it looks on her.She hated being filmed. It explains why she hardly says anything in the video. That was not like her at all. I wish she had said more on camera, just so I can hear her speak. But the fact that she is there is enough, occupying a space in this world, a grainy image of her physical presence that is now out of touch.Already there is a moment in the video I find myself waiting for every time I put it on. At one point she comes through the swing doors that separated our kitchenette from the living room and, as the camera adjusts to the March light streaming through the window, itrsquos clear she is smoking. Jeanie is smoking.I had almost forgotten. How could I have forgotten  It had been something she had done as long as Irsquod known her.She would give it up a year, maybe  months, later with the same steely self-will she later brought to learning to play guitar or speak Esperanto. A task to be achieved.But in the fuzzy, flickering yellow video light, the image rolling and glitchy with age, she can be seen drawing fumes into her lungs with such obvious pleasure that the sight of it felt like a depth charge in my head, a memory of who she once was, of the girl I first met in a student kitchen in Stirling University in September . We were both  then. She was barefooted and wearing a headscarf because her hairdresser had given her a buzzcut, much to her disgust.She sat there smoking and swearing and talking. She was this leforce. I donrsquot know how  to describe her. She was self-confident and outgoing, all the things I wasnrsquot. I was totally smitten. What she saw in me, I still donrsquot know.In time I realised that we had some things in common. We were both working-class kids in a still largely middle-class environment. She had her own vulnerabilities like everyone . Irsquom not sure what I represented to her, but I was happy to represent something, anything.I asked her out. In the most roundabout of ways. And she said no. And then she said yes. And that was the start of the rest of our lives. We got together, stayed together, grew up, got married, had kids, were happy.In my head there are all these dferent versions of Jeanie the -year-old firebrand, the thirtysomething mother, the dedicated professional , the girl who would get drunk with her dad and her sisters every Hogmanay and start singing Leaving on a Jet Plane. The Jeanie who immersed herself in anything that interested her. The Jeanie who could make you laugh just by the way she looked at you.For a few days after her death I found myself resentful about the last incarnation of Jeanie, the one who increasingly was drting away from us, the one I had been caring for in the last weeks of her le. I loved that version too, of course, but the memory of this last Jeanie was so close, so tight against me, that I couldnrsquot see past her to all the others Irsquod spent the best part of  years with.It took my friends Karina and Michael to put me right. Jean and I had met Karina for a coffee in September just before Karina went back to Buenos Aires to look after her own sick mother. It was a farewell meeting. We all knew it.A few weeks later, after Jeanrsquos funeral, Michael told me what Karina had told him about that day, about how, when I was off where for a few moments, Jeanie had told her that she knew what was happening to her and that she was at peace with it.Hearing that felt like a damn breaking inside me. My viewpoint shted  degrees. Suddenly it came home to me how stoical that last version of Jeanie was, how brave. When she was initially diagnosed in , she had struggled to deal with it. But when it ed in  she refused to give into despair. All she wanted, she said, was to see the end of Game of Thrones. She managed that at least.The thing is she wouldnrsquot want you to know any of this. Jeanie was intensely private. She hated me mentioning her in anything I wrote. And this illness. Well, this was her business. But I guess itrsquos my business now. And what is this business  That Irsquom not sure I know.I do know that over and above losing herI have somehow also lost my own sense of self. I was so synced to Jeanie that I amnow unfixed, ungrounded. What Irsquove realised in this no time eternity that Irsquom currently living in, is I donrsquot really know what Irsquom for any more.I am still a father and a son and a brother and brother-in-law and a friend . But I navigated through the world with Jean as my lodestar. And now that star has disappeared, and the night is dark.I donrsquot believe in heaven but I have taken to thinking about the possibility of parallel universes. I like the idea that somewhere there is another Jeanie even now. In most of them I guess she would never have met me. Or maybe she met me and didnrsquot like me, or vice versa . But I want to believe she is out there. Somewhere, I hope, Jeanie is smoking a cigarette and enjoying it as much as she does in our wedding video.In the week after Jeanrsquos death we put a notice in the Falkirk Herald. The Philip Larkin line from his poem An Arundel Tomb seemed appropriate: ldquoWhat will survive of us is love. It comes at the end of a poem in which Larkin is trying to suggest otherwise. But I want it to be true.Yesterday would have been your birthday, Jeanie. What survives of you is love. Thatrsquos why this hurts so much.

townrsquos revamp include repurposing the Paisley Centre shopping hub into a new residential quarter with ground-floor retail, as well as introducing a European-style food hall housing independent bars and eateries.Public spaces for outdoor activity could also be introduced, alongside lanes and streets creating new views and routes to lsquohiddenrsquo parts of the town centre.Meanwhile, vacant historic buildings such as the Liberal Club, YMCA building and TA Building could be brought back into use, and a high street cinema opened to attract visitors.Parts of university and college campuses could also be relocated into the heart of the town centre.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the study ldquorepresents another signicant milestone in the regeneration of Paisley and is further evidence of the ambition and commitment of the local community and partners.She said: ldquoA huge opportunity now exists to use this collaborative vision to create more positive change in the

It will, above all, be a test of her judgment.If she persists in the fiction that she can have Indyref this year, her reputation may never recover.You can see why itrsquos hard to admit the gamersquos a bogie though.Besides letting down the SNP members she has marched up so many hills, Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP last month would stop Brexit, stop Boris, and deliver Indyref.The first and second didnrsquot pan out, leaving her clinging to the third.If she gives up on that too, itrsquos three strikes. Not a good look for a leader under daily attack for over-promising and under-delivering in government.But a wistful climbdown is surely better than a damaging pantomime.After all, when she hit pause on independence for two years after the  snap election, she ultimately went on to greater success.Itrsquos hard to see who Ms Sturgeon could even convince. Not even SNP HQ appears to believe her timetable.Last week a number of former party luminaries said the Yes movement needed a new campaign vehicle, something like Yes Scotland in .But while the legal entity behind Better Together was dissolved after the No vote, Yes Scotland actually lives on, maintained in a state of suspended animation at Companies House by the SNPrsquos in-house solicitor.It could be cranked back to lewanted. Instead, it gathers dust.Then there are the campaign website names the SNP bought on the back of the Brexit referendum.You may remember the party launched a poundm fundraiser through the ref.scot website after Ms Sturgeon first announced in March  that she intended to hold Indyref.It has since fallen into disuse.The SNP also bought mobilise.scot and organise.scot as part of its push.The ownership has been allowed to lapse and both are up for sale again.Nor is there a refreshed case for independence, and time is flying by.The SNP has yet to prepare public opinion for its new position on adopting a Scottish currency as soon as practicable after independence.It has not said how it would respond to Brexit, particularly how it would handle trade and customs arrangements with Englandit was out of the EU and Scotland rejoined.ldquoIf we go into a referendum offering a hard border at Gretna wersquore f***ed, as one SNP MSP puts it.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland redefining what it means to be successful nationIndeed, itrsquos hard to see how anyone could offer such plans until we know what Brexit looks like - after the UK-EU trade talks this year.Then there is White Paper .It was reported yesterday that Ms Sturgeonrsquos officials continue to revise the slab-like prospectus of  to ensure Scots can make ldquoan informed choice over the future of our country.The Tories were duly outraged at this, given Mr Johnsonrsquos rejection of referendum powers for Holyrood.I was not at all outraged. As independence is the governmentrsquos avowed policy, it is natural for it to task civil servants with developing that policy. But where is it The original White Paper was published almost  days before the  referendum to give voters time to study its  pages.As Ms Sturgeon holds up that referendum as the ldquogold standard template for the next one, it would seem White Paper  is already late.Agreed, there are  days left in . But December and November arenrsquot candidates for Indyref because of Christmas and the massive COP climate conference in Glasgow draining police resources.The last practical date would be October, and that means there is already less time to study any new White Paper than last time.Yet the Scottish Government said only this week, in response to a freedom of information request, that it would be updating the White Paper ldquoover the next few months.Soit ever does emerge, there may be only half the time of  to come to ldquoan informed choice, plus it would be full of holes about Brexit.It would hardly be an advert for efficient, joyous government outside the Union - and thatrsquos before the stooshie about the bill for printing it and getting it to every household.Ms Sturgeon would be accused of taunting taxpayers with their own cash, sending them a non-prospectus for a non-referendum.The First Minister is a formidable politician. Her opponents may criticise her record and goals, but they respect and envy her ability.They would not characterise her as slapdash or unprofessional.Butshe were to blow millions on a rush-job White Paper without a legal referendum in sight, or play to impatient Yessers by attempting a hillbilly referendum of her own, that respect would be lost overnight.She would be damned as cavalier, a loose cannon not to be trusted with devolution far less independence.Ms Sturgeon wonrsquot like it, but her choice is between retreat now with dignity or retreat later without it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10944130.jpg?type=article-full","title":"volunteers-needed-build-17th-century-house-glencoe","story":"The National Trust for Scotlandis offering those with an interest in the past an opportunity to build a replica house fit for a th-century crofter ndash complete with turf roof and wattle and daub walls.The project is part of a push to explore the story of Glen Coe and find the ldquolost villages which vanished from the map in the aftermath of the infamous massacre of .Volunteers will help create the type of dwelling used by the glenrsquos inhabitants on the eve of the attack by government soldiers, which led to the deaths of around  men, women and children.Many of the buildings were put to the torch while livestock were driven off, and settlements which had stood for centuries disappeared from the map.Now a new ldquoturfhouse, which would have been familiar to those departed villagers, will rise again in the grounds of the Glencoe Visitor Centre, which reopened last year after a major refurbishment.Glencoe Operations Manager Emily BryceGlencoe Operations Manager Emily Bryce said: ldquoItrsquos nearly a year since we revamped our Glencoe visitor centre and this project, with the support of public donations, is our next step in sharing the story of this incredible landscape which we are so proud to protect.ldquoItrsquos very exciting that wersquoll be able to involve the public and visitors in such a hands-on way. Wersquoll also be working with our local community and schools too, and are keen to make sure that the whole area benefits from this project.Glen Coe was the scene of one of the clan erarsquos most notorious episodes in Scottish history, when the British state conspired with local chiefs to attack the MacDonald clan who called the glen their home over their failure to pledge allegiance to King William III in time.Soldiers from the Earl of Argyllrsquos regiment, who had been staying in the glen and enjoying the famous Highland hospitality of its inhabitants, suddenly turned on their hosts on the morning of February , .Dozens were slaughtered while many more were driven over the bleak hills in the dead of winter, where they died from exposure as they fled ill-clothed and unprepared.In the years that followed the area was largely given over to sheep farming, with the remaining inhabitants forced to move where.The Trust has been investigating three villages which were abandoned during that time ndash Inverigan, Achnacon and Achtriochtan ndash and the reconstructed turfhouse will be used to highlight the way their inhabitants lived, more than  years ago.Archaeologists have been excavating in GlencoeHolidaymakers who help build the structure will get the chance to work in a wide iety of tasks, including whittling wooden pegs to weaving wattle walls, archaeological excavations and mud daubing.To oversee the project, NTS has recruited a team with vast experience in traditional building methods, while archaeologists who have explored the area will work on the buildingrsquos design.These specialists in turf-building, heather thatching, wattle and daub, timber creel and cruck frame structures will lead trainees and volunteers over the course of the year in the unique experiment in historical reconstruction.The project is being made possible thanks to members of the public from around the world who donated to a fundraising appeal last year.In  the conservation charity that protects Scotlandrsquos national and natural treasures invested over poundm in Glencoe Visitor Centre, transforming the existing eco-friendly buildings into a more modern, immersive and welcoming ldquogateway to the world-renowned glen.The visitor centre has a  seat film screening space showing a specially-commissioned film which takes viewers on a -minute journey from the glenrsquos volcanic origins and its tragic past, while also examining its enduring popularity with tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.A large D map and an Info Hub was also installed to help visitors plan their adventures and share advice on how to explore the area responsibly.The Glencoe Visitor Centre also plays an essential part in generating income to support the NTSrsquos conservation work in Glencoe National Nature Reserve, where it oversees the protection of more than , acres of wilderness, including km of footpaths and eight Munros."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-got-english-casual-arrogant-ignorance","story":"She doubted many things in her ordinary, extraordinary le her middle years spent in England like many of her country women but she never doubted her right to live in a free Ireland.Born into a Republican family she was reared on the injustices meted out to her poor country as her own le weathered servitude, poverty, sickness and all the tragedies that make up a personal history.At the same time, Irsquom reading Victoria Hisloprsquos lsquoThose Who Are Loved,rsquo a family saga set against the backdrop of wartime occupation in Greece and the subsequent civil war.The two books couldnrsquot be more dferent in setting and pace and yet so alike in the fierceness of the determination of the two central women to set their countries free.One grew up in the Irish Free State, where homes were still ided in the bitter aftermath of the civil war, and the country lanes were dotted with hand spun memorials to the fallen and the murdered.The other fought with the Communists against foes who were once allies, and at warrsquos end, like so many, was tracked down, captured, re-educated by torture ndash by her own people whorsquod learned well at the hands of the fascists.One book a biography, the other a novel. One woman real, the other a beautully drawn imaginary portrait.Laying down the books what stayed with me was the essence, the spirit of both, and the feeling that one had grasped the mood of both countries.I know one country well, the other not at all. I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster. A desire ndash long before the words were so grotesquely appropriated by the Brexiters ndash to take back control.I lsquogotrsquo it. And I lsquogotrsquo the English too in their casual, arrogant ignorance and lack of interest in anything other than them.I got it having grown up in a country which also was powering towards a new destiny remembering the past but not in thrall to it looking forward to Europe and not back to the chains of an inglorious Empire.So, when I comment, I comment from a little knowledge, from a tapping in to, not just the history, but the spirit.It is why I am constantly surprised by commentators who pronounce on Scotland, on referendums and on the Party, which is the driving force for Independence.Many words are expended on reasons why that should not be, using suspect financial lsquofactsrsquo and endless repetition of half, long negated arguments that research would have knocked down immediately.Some of the arguments against Scotland leaving the Union are well-reasoned and well worth consideration but these too are knocked down by the lamentable chippiness of some who are as blind as the commentators they dismiss.Itrsquos a word blindness activated by what is seen as a malevolent force robbing and battering the Scots from time immemorial. That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode. But the British made a mistake and murdered them in Kilmainham Gaol, creating heroes and firing up the land.The British always make a mistake because they never understand the soul of a country.Patience."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-bawdy-beautiful","story":"IT being Burns Night this evening, we would be remisswe didnrsquot celebrate the bonnie, bawdy Bard of Ayrshire on this page.

This caused much hilarity among the crew, who decided to prolong the fun.They borrowed the skipperrsquos  teeth and placed them in a creel as it was brought on deck. What a miracle, they explained. What a chance in a million for the sea to yield up the dentures which had been so cruelly lost. The victim of their hoax was quite amazed and put in the said  teeth. But they remained in his mouth only a few seconds. ldquoAch, these arenrsquot my teeth, he grumbled as he pulled out the skipperrsquos dentures and tossed them into the sea.Dodgy docLIKE Burns, Chic Murray was a genius of a very Scottish sort, whose material was sometimes a smidgen saucy.

Those who can harness it quickly discover that it can be turned into sharp profit without meddlesome factors like human labour, factory costs and a care for the environment. This has transformed the act of placing a bet on a sporting outcome.:Brian Rice case highlight how approach to gambling in Scottish football has to be revisitedPreviously, the issues associated with addiction and problem gambling were unintended and unsought. Irsquom not saying here you could ever have characterised this industry by its empathy for the flawed human condition. Once, there had been a degree of humanity though, where checks and balances might be provided simply by visiting a bookmakers and interacting with friends and neighbours.Now, billions are spent by the online gambling industry to ensure that addiction isnrsquot an unfortunate consequence but a desired outcome. And professional football, the most popular sport in the world, is where the lowest-hanging fruit is to be found.This week, Brian Rice, the respected manager of Hamilton Academical FC, became the latest high-profile football person to admit that he has been struggling with gambling addiction for most of his adult le.His story is only the latest in a long litany of human tragedies associated with football and gambling.Almost immediately the football tribe ndash managers, players and journalists ndash threw a protective cordon around him and praised Mr Rice for his dignity and courage in going public with his ordeal. Predictably, they strove to absolve the football authorities and our major clubs from any blame that might have attached to them owing to their lucrative association with online gambling.Some of their arguments were reasonable.After all, much of the sponsorship cash can be spent on developing young players and supporting nearby health and wellbeing initiatives in local communities.This though, is a bit like saying thatyou swim with sharks it can give you a greaterappreciation of their natural environment.  There is a reason why the predatory giants of the online gambling industry have targeted professional football. In no other sphere of human endeavour do so many working-class people gather in such huge numbers at regular intervals.According to recently reported research the industry is using third-party companies to collect personal data and thus enable online casinos to target low-income customers and ex-gamblers. One former digital marketing specialist in the industry said: ldquoThird-party data providers allowed us to target their email lists with precision. Lower-income users were among the most successfully targeted segments.The eye-watering profits accruing from gambling allow operators to use every artice and lever at their disposal to ensure they are ring-fenced. In the House of Commons several MPs recently sought to defend fixed-odds betting machines , the so-called ldquocrack cocaine of gambling in the face of Government proposals to limit them. These politicians were later revealed to have received expensive gts and hospitality from the betting industry.:Neil Cameron: Brian Rice case nothing to do with hypocrisySo vast and pernicious is the influence of the gambling lobby that in , the former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, was forced to admit defeat. She resigned after the government refused to back down on the timetable for reducing the maximum stake on FOBMs. She had wanted the change to be made earlier than the planned date of October . Yet senior colleagues ignored her even when she said that the delay could lead to hundreds of people killing themselves because of gambling addiction linked to these machines.Ms Crouch wasnrsquot indulging in emotional hyperbole here. In , research published in the journal Neuron, found that gambling makes people susceptible to depression and anxiety by altering the brainrsquos physical structure. Previous research had consistently found links associating gambling with debt, family breakdown and a suite of mental health issues.The new research though, found thatthese affective disorders diminish the capacity to tolerate economic risk.The online behemoths prey on menwhen they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they are watching live football and drinking.Their smartphone devices are weaponised by the online companies to extract as much money as possible from them in the two-hour window available to them.Odds are offered on every twist and turn of the action by a bewildering array of online products that bookend the televised pictures and analysis. The Gambling Commission recently fined a major online firm poundm after it missed more than  incidents indicating behaviour associated with a problem gambler. On one occasion the gambler immediately re-staked substantial winnings, suggesting this was either a money-laundering operation or an affluent addict. Yet this occurs much more often further down the financial scale but escapes scrutiny owing to the smaller sums.The football authorities which solicit these firms and the clubs who prostitute themselves to them are just as culpable in spreading the disease of gambling addiction. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to destroy the lives of their most vulnerable and disadvantaged supporters.My own team, Celtic, have won more trophies than I could ever have hoped for during my letime. Yet I would gladly trade all of them to redeem the le of one person and their family ruined by addiction to gambling.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help. Repossessions and homelessness increased.-: Payday loans, combined with a lack of affordable housing, caused unprecedented levels of debt. Welfare reform left many families in debt, with Universal Credit generating enormous numbers of enquiries."},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Around  places will be available on these Glencoe Thistle Camps.Glencoe operations manager Emily Bryce said: “It’s nearly a year since we revamped our Glencoe visitor centre and this project, with the support of public donations, is our next step in sharing the story of this incredible landscape which we are so proud to protect.“It’s very exciting that we’ll be able to involve the public and visitors in such a hands-on way. We’ll also be working with our local community and schools too, and are keen to make sure that the whole area benefits from this project.”The trust has recruited a team of Scotland’s most experienced traditional building craftspeople to work with their archaeologists on the building design. This follows a series of archaeological digs investigating long-lost historic dwellings at the heart of the glen at Achtriachtan.These specialists in turf-building, heather thatching, wattle and daub, timber creel and cruck frame structures will lead trainees and volunteers over the course of the year in this experiment in historical reconstruction. The building will be located in the grounds of Glencoe visitor centre, offering access for more than , visitors every year.The project is being made possible thanks to members of the public from around the world who donated to a fundraising appeal last year.As Valentine’s Day approaches, the charity is launching its Hugs of Heather campaign, which will give supporters the chance to show their love for the glen and support the project.The conservation charity that protects Scotland’s national and natural treasures last year invested more than £ million at Glencoe visitor centre, transforming the existing eco-friendly buildings into a more modern, immersive and welcoming ‘gateway’ to this world-renowned glen.The visitor centre has a -seat film screening space showing a specially-commissioned film that takes viewers on a ten-minute journey from the glen’s volcanic origins towards the scene of the tragic events of the  Glencoe Massacre.The massacre took place on  February , with the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe slaughtered while they slept by Captain Robert Campbell and his men.The day is imprinted in Scottish history, not only because of the number of people who lost their lives, but because the men had enjoyed their victims’ hospitality in the days leading up to the massacre.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots. He may be an apex predator, but he’s only asubstandard quarter away from losing his crown.Thegig economy is sold with promises of self-empowerment and personal agency thereality for Ricky is -hour days, a black box all-seeing eye that has timingsdown to the second, and financial penaltiesa sht is missed # for whateverreason, whether family emergency or personal injury.

On his first day with PDF, Ricky ishanded an empty plastic bottle by a co-worker. For male drivers in a hurry, itis an essential piece of equipment.Ricky’smachine-tooled existence is mirrored by his we’s.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Paisley sees vote dip but he keeps vice-like grip on North Antrim Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic returning to normal after ballyclare collision","story":"Road users are advised that an earlier road traffic collision in the Tildarg area has now been cleared.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: “An earlier road traffic collision on the B Collin Road in the Tildarg area of Ballyclare has now been cleared and traffic is getting back to normal.”Police are at the scene.Drugs and cash seized after three vehicle collision - PSNI also raid drivers home Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2691691.jpg--.jpg?1579168441000\n","title":"good health matters and christmas cheer at glarryford wi","story":"PRESIDENT Vera McBurney welcomed speaker Robert Dick to the November meeting in Glarryford Farmers’ Hall.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

The third person is a parent of one of the first two people diagnosed, the ministry said.In part because of Europe’s open borders, the minister said she expects more cases.“We see how dficult it is in today’s world to close the frontiers.

Hence the need to piece together patient histories and to find people who were in contact with the patient,” she said.“We will do everything possible to confine this epidemic,” she pledged.The French minister promised “total transparency” as the country battles the outbreak and said her ministry would give daily news updates “so there is no  information on social networks”.She said informing the public is “the most effective barrier” against the spread of the virus, more so than taking people’s temperatures as they arrive at airports and other entry points to testthey have a fever.“People only need to take aspirin  minutes before landing to no longer have a fever,” she said.The number of confirmed cases around the world has climbed sharply to more than , the bulk of them in China.

Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, who lives in the Creggan area said it is a “vital and important” development for the community but also expressed his concern that the project received no financial support from the government or local authorities. “It has been four decades since Creggan has had direct and convenient access to dedicated professional health care services on its doorstep. I would commend Creggan Enterprises, a local charity and social enterprise, for their vision and commitment to delivering on this much needed community service. googletag.cmd.push “And it must be noted that despite the constant state and media focus on Creggan, and the clearly articulated need for investment in communities like Creggan – it is inspiringsomewhat concerning that Creggan Enterprises was required to self-finance this crucial capital project.” Cllr Donnelly added: “It is indeed concerning that this much needed, innovative project did not receive financial support from any local authority, government body or department – despite the massive health inequalities facing the inhabitants of this community. “It is my understanding that the new state of the art facility will provide not only GP provision but also a dedicated MDT service, which will help address many of the physical and mental health needs of this growing community. googletag.cmd.push “I wish the project every success and I am sure that it will generate enormous health and well-being benefits for the people of Creggan and beyond.” Sinn Feacutein Cllr Tina Burke welcomed the facility as a “great addition” to community infrastructure within the area. “It is timely because we are actually in the middle of the Triax mental health week which is where all organisations are trying to promote services within the area. “I’d like to say well done to Creggan Enterprises in leading it and for pushing forward with the initiative, it’s a much needed service and it’s great that we will have it here in the middle of Creggan.” ‘Accessible’ Local health spokesperson for the SDLP, Mark H. Durkan described it as a “very positive development.” He added: “It’s well accepted that the best way to deliver health care is by providing services in the community. “It brings services closer to people and reduces pressure on our hospitals at the same time. It’s vital that these services are accessible to people, whereas in the past we have seen huge dficulty in accessing some services, particularly in the area of mental health.” Meanwhile, People Before Profit Cllr for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, enthusiastically received the hub saying: “It brings the provision of medicine and health care closer to the community. “It will make it less stressful for people going to seek basic medical treatment. At times services like medical centres and post offices have been seen to desert the community so what’s happening in Raacuteth Moacuter, which sits in between the Bogside and Creggan, will benefit the entire community. “We have to create a healthy environment for people in terms of air quality and so on but also create medical facilities for those who fall ill. It’s the type of development People Before Profit and I would welcome.” Commenting on the -year gap in medical provision in Creggan, he added: “It’s a bit of a paradox. It’s no surprise but all statistics would show that the poorer a community is, when inequalities exist in a community, then the more likely you are to have medical problems. “So, it’s important that health provision should be as close as possible to those most likely to need it.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They often neglect to inform the applicant until the application has been in the system for weeks, causing unnecessary delays and obviously frustration.”“It stands to reason thatwe had a passport office in the north, which would be more accessible to residents from Donegal to Antrim, issues would be easier to resolve.”“In the meantime, our office in South Derry has a supply of blank passport forms and we are happy to sign them for everyone.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s just not about buying equipment and supplying resources, said Mr McLaughlin.Don’t get me wrong, the doctors are amazing in the unit and le savers, but as parents you just don’t bond with them the way you do with the nurses.They are there  hours a daycaring for the babies.The McLaughlins endured a dficult time after the birth of their daughters, with two premature babies to care for.The Twin to Twin Syndrome meant the girls had received an uneven blood supply in the womb and because they were also born early they needed help to feed and breathe.The couple spent many anxious hours by their daughters incubators and during that time they saw first hand the work of the nurses in the unit.Good news or bad news, the nurses are there to celebrate with you or to pick up the pieces, said Mr McLaughlin.They prepared us mentally for everything coming and saw us through it.Many times we saw nurses miss lunch breaks and dinner breaks because the unit was stretched.We saw them missing their children’s or husbands birthdays because the unit was understaffed.One thing about those nurses, their patients always came first.Mr McLaughlin said he fully supported the recent strike action undertaken by nurses and health service staff for pay parity and safer staffing levels.Spending nearly two months with them we saw that they have financial commitments and dfi- culties like everyone . It was very upsetting for us to learn they were being treated dferently from their colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales.If the person who makes these decisions walked in the footsteps of our neonatal nurses for a week, they might think dferently.Just before Christmas, Saorlaith and Soairse deliveredpound, of Foyleside Shopping Centre vouchers to the nurses, which was raised through a raffle and quiz night.This year we organised a stand alone event for our NICU nurses simply because they deserve it and we wanted to let them know how much the public think of them,”said Mr McLaughlin.We have received Facebook messages and thank you cards from nurses we have never met so it just showed us how much it meant to them.The night we left over their Foyleside vouchers the strike was a hot topic and it was the perfect time to reassure the nurses they had massive support in our community and that we understood why they were doing it. It was just nice that the community were there for the nurses when they needed a bit of help and support with the strikes and I know they were over the moon with the Foyleside vouchers.In Saorlaith and Saoirses eyes it was mission accomplished.Earlier this month, the twins delivered the latest cheque forpound,. to the NICU.A spokesperson for Western Health and Social Care Trust said: This is the fourth donation the McLaughlin family have made toNICUas a show of appreciation for the great care Saorlaith and Saoirse received during their time there in .The family has raised a total of pound, for the Unit.Staff in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are overwhelmed by the incredible generosity of the McLaughlin family, the local community and businesses who have been fundraising to support our premature babies and their families who we care for in the Unit.Thank you to everyone who has donated it is very much appreciated. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any directive to make savings.In addition, CIL argues that plans to replace the existing filament light with a modern LED will not result in major changes to the sweeping beam.They contend that the proposed changes will deliver a ldquobetter quality, environmentally superior solution which aligns with current health and safety requirements and allow for the retention of the historic Fresnel rotating lens which was installed in .Commissioners also insist that the range of the new LED light will be  miles in accordance with the Navigation Requirements for the UK and Ireland, with St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

renowned tourism designation.Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion feature heavily in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for prestigious UNESCO geopark status which has the potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

four defendants contended on the basis of what was disclosed, their respective clients should not be ed for trial.But District Judge Steven Keown rejected their argument and held the prosecution case ldquohad not fallen short. He ruled there is satisfied there is a case to answer against all defendants, and any evidence which was disputed is a matter for the crown court.The committal procedure went ahead during which the defendants chose not to call witnesses or give evidence on their own behalf.Judge Keown remanded them on existing bail to appear before Dungannon Crown Court for formal arraignment next month.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here, she explains the basics...So, how does it work The basic principal is that the moon has a pulling effect on all water. This includes the sap in plants, which rises during the ascending moon and falls towards the roots when it descends.When the sap rises, its a good time to sow seeds when it descends, its time to do work that involves the plants root system, such as planting seedlings, thinning them out and propagating by ision or layering.Lunar gardening tracks the .-day sidereal path of the moon, which is its journey around the zodiac in relation to the constellations, not the path which consists of one complete cycle of the moons phases, such as from one new moon to the next.How do you work out which phase youre in The easiest way for newcomers to lunar gardening is to download an app such as Moon  Garden , which gives details of the lunar calendar and shows you what you should be planting and the jobs you should be doing at any particular time.Where do signs of the zodiac come in Each sign of the zodiac belongs to a particular element - Air, Earth, Fire or Water. The theory behind lunar gardening is that as the moon moves through each sign, it transmits the energy of that element to the earth.Whether youre digging the soil, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, weeding, hoeing or pruning, always do it when the moon is in the appropriate element for the type of plant youre tending.Fire plants These are plants grown for their fruits or seeds, including soft fruits such as strawberries, stone fruits like apricots and top fruits such as apples and pears, as well as tomatoes, cucumbers, chillies, peppers and beans.Earth plants These are grown for their roots and include carrots, parsnips, potatoes and onions.Air plants These are plants grown for their flowers, such as geraniums, violets and roses, as well as flowering bulbs and rhizomes. In the vegetable garden air plants include broccoli and artichokes, because their heads are flower buds.Water plants These are all grown for their leaves. Lettuces, cabbages, leeks and leafy herbs are in this category.The idea is to only work on plants that belong to a particular element, or the soil in which the plants will be grown, when the moon is in that element. So,youre just tidying up your greenhouse to prepare to plant out tomato seedlings, do it on a Fire day.When should I harvest Harvest Fire element plants on Fire days, preferably when the moon is ascending, but not on Air days. Harvest root plants on Earth days but not on Water days. Air element plants should be harvested on Air days but not on Fire days, and Water plants are best harvested on Fire or Air days.The moons influence regulates the amount of moisture in the plants, so storing them at the wrong time can mean they will be either too dry when you eat them, or too wet when you store them. Make sure you check on the correct lunar phase for the best result.Are there any times I should avoid gardening Dont do any gardening at least six hours either side of a new or full moon, and at least  hours either side of an eclipse, because the moons energy is too strong and may adversely affect the plants and the soil.Moonpower by Jane Struthers is published by Eddison Books, priced pound..

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
