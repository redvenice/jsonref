Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsEmployees hoping to work from home in future may have to carry out a self-assessment on issues like the suitability of their workspace and data protection requirements under the proposed new law to provide the right to request remote working.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar unveiled the heads of the Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2021 as he said that, now Covid-19 restrictions had been lifted, he wanted workers to have a choice of being able to work remotely or in hybrid arrangements if they wished.Under the plans, employers will be able to refuse to grant an employee’s right to work remotely on at least 13 different grounds.However, they will have to be able to justify the decision if it is appealed either internally or to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).Mr Varadkar said reasons for a refusal would “have to stack up and be solid” and that decisions of the WRC would be binding.‘Easier to say yes’He said working from home was not possible in some jobs but the intention of the new law was to “make it easier for employers to say yes and harder for them to say no”.Under the proposals, all employers must have a formal remote working policy and they can specify the self-assessment requirements in relation to the proposed work location in these policies. The draft legislation says an employee’s written request for remote working will have to include a “self-assessment of the suitability of the proposed remote working locations regarding specific requirements for carrying out the job such as data protection and confidentiality, minimum levels of internet connectivity, ergonomic suitability of proposed workspace and any equipment or furniture requirements”.Codes of practiceThe  asked the Department of Enterprise if employees will get assistance in completing self-assessments of the proposed work location given that most people do not have expertise in areas like data protection or ergonomics.It said information would also be provided in the form of templates for remote work policies to assist employers develop their own policy and to help them identify the types of information and procedures that should be outlined in it. The statement added: “The requirement for a self-assessment, and the information required to be contained within one, will be matters for employers to specify in their remote work policy, and an employee will be guided by that policy and the codes of practice in completing same.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord d%C3%A1il s big reopening day turns out to be not so big","story":" Around Leinster House the canteen was purring again with all tables reinstated and the lunchtime buzz well and truly back. TDs were allowed bring guests into the building again. Photograph: Getty ImagesThere was more than a hint of the Hey Presto! about Micheál’s lavish Restoration drama on the steps of Government Buildings.Catherine Connolly was certainly dazzled by the performance. “I know that with a ‘puff!’ from the Magic Dragon the restrictions were lifted at six o’clock last Friday,” acknowledged the Independent TD for Galway West, “and it would be churlish of me not to recognise the sense of relief and excitement felt by a lot of people.”However, the decision was taken outside the Dáil despite Deputies having discussed Covid-19 measures throughout the pandemic. Now TDs are getting phone calls looking for clarification on a number of important issues. People say they are still not allowed into nursing homes to visit their loved ones, and others want to know why daycare centres are not operating. There are also questions about compensation schemes and pandemic payments.She called for “a full and frank discussion on an informed basis on the floor of the Dáil” as soon as possible on the “context of the lifting of Covid restrictions”.The Taoiseach, looking relaxed after enjoying a few restorative Restoration pints over the weekend, was taken by Catherine’s opening line.“It’s the first time I’ve ever been referred to as a magic dragon...” he replied, cracking that knowing little smile of somebody who thinks he is about to say something funny, “... but eh, but there might been a few dragons in it…but, eh…”Whatever the Taoiseach was going to say next about whomever (ears could have been burning down Nphet way or maybe he was thinking about certain Cabinet colleagues) he thought the better of it. Swiftly changing course, he clamped his serious face back on again. “Eh, but in terms of the public health decision I think it is a good idea to have a Dáil debate.”Next week should be a good time, he reckoned. So another lengthy pandemic debate is on the cards, hardly a happy week into the Restoration. This is Long Covid, Leinster House-style, where the humdrum dragons never run out of puff. Old chamberNonetheless there was great excitement in Kildare Street at the prospect of the Dáil returning to full capacity again after almost two years of reduced numbers and passionless politicking. Tuesday was a big day in the old chamber, with no more social distancing required and a welcome for everyone in a free-for-all House.Finally, not forgetting the spaced out months spent wittering for Ireland in the cavernous Dublin Convention Centre, normal service was being resumed.There was great excitement about the place, wasn’t there? Not really.The 2020 intake of first-time TDs did not flood the chamber for their inaugural burning cheek by quivering jowl experience of full-throated roaring during Leaders’ Questions. The old hands, for all their whinging during the unpleasantness about missing the old atmosphere, didn’t bother their booster shots to make it inside either.When the week’s business commenced at 2pm with Micheál and Mary Lou set to potentially perform before a packed hall for the first time in ages, it quickly became clear that there wouldn’t be any need to hang the “house full” signs from the handles.At least Sinn Féin made the effort. Mary Lou McDonald’s troops displayed their trademark discipline and fully populated their portion of the benches, looking like a proper opposition. Full marks to party whip Padraig MacLochlainn for turning them out.The same can’t be said for Government TDs. The Taoiseach was supported by four Ministers, five Junior Ministers and a piffling three coalition backbenchers, none of whom were from his own Fianna Fáil party. It was not a good look. The other parties and groupings fared no better. Six TDsBy contrast Labour leader Alan Kelly, pencilled in for a slot during Leaders’ Questions, managed to muster a full half of his Dáil team for Restoration Day. Impressive, until you realise he only has six TDs. The SocDems were a no-show until later in the proceedings, when Gary Gannon put in an appearance.The main theme was the rising rate of inflation and the Government’s efforts to counteract it. As the cost of living rises and household bills soar, Mary Lou had surprisingly little faith in the coalition’s ability to deal with the mounting crisis.“Far too slow to react,” she said. There has been no “step change” in policy over the last two years. “What we have seen is more of the same,” she told the Taoiseach. Apart from the hike in utility prices, this is also evident in the continuing rise in house prices and rents. “The truth is that you have continued with the same of the same.”Not content with heckling about house prices, Sinn Féin’s property intellectual in residence Eoin Ó Broin also had the time to tweet his thoughts about the Taoiseach’s replies to his leader Mary Lou.“Micheál Martin in total denial about housing, health and cost of living crises in Leaders’ Questions today. Like Waylon Smithers, he is detached from reality, out of touch \u0026amp out of ideas…#Time4Change,” he dashed off while Leaders’ Questions was still in session.Unfortunately multitasking Eoin tweeted a picture of Simpson’s character Monty Burns with his sizzling social media burn. Fortunately his error was quickly corrected and Smithers got the heave-ho in the updated version. MiserlyThe spiraling cost of living – “even pasta has gone by 5 per cent in the last two months” said Alan Kelly – was held up against the Government’s intention to give people €113.50 off their electricity bill, a move which was rubbished by various speakers as “a joke”, “miserly”, “insulting” and “tokenistic”.But the Taoiseach said “targeted ways” were needed to help people achieve acceptable living standards “without adding to the inflationary cycle”. He kept mentioning “the Vincentian Model” as a good system to follow, but didn’t explain what that is.“We need to avoid a wages spiral,” he cautioned.“You didn’t worry about a wages spiral for the general secretary of the Department of Health,” shot back Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy.Elsewhere around Leinster House the canteen was purring again with all tables reinstated and the lunchtime buzz well and truly back. TDs were allowed bring guests into the building again. And the stools returned to their rightful place at the counter in the bar.Business was very quiet, though. It was well past teatime before the first visitor crossed the threshold for a drink. Anthony Monaghan from Tipperary earned that singular honour, up at the bar enjoying a quick pint courtesy of his host Mattie McGrath, who was delighted that his guest was the first visitor in almost two years to raise a glass in the Dáil bar."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the

targeted covid vaccine in us","story":"‘While . . . boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time.’ Photograph:  Mahmud HamsAFP via Getty Images A clinical trial to test a new version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine specifically designed to target the Covid-19 Omicron variant, which has eluded some of the protection provided by the original two-dose vaccine regimen, has started, the companies said on Tuesday.The companies plan to test the immune response generated by the Omicron-based vaccine both as a three-shot regimen in unvaccinated people and as a booster shot for people who already received two doses of their original vaccine.They are also testing a fourth dose of the current vaccine against a fourth dose of the Omicron-based vaccine in people who received their third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three to six months earlier.The companies plan to study the safety and tolerability of the shots in the more than 1,400 people who will be enrolled in the trial.“While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation with Omicron, we recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,” Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development, Kathrin Jansen, said in a statement.Pfizer has said that a two-dose regimen of the original vaccine may not be sufficient to protect against infection from the Omicron variant, and that protection against hospitalisations and deaths may be waning.Still, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a third dose of an mRNA vaccine such as the PfizerBioNTech vaccine has provided 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation due to Covid-19.Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent infection by the Omicron variant.BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters in November that regulators would not likely require testing of an Omicron-based vaccine on humans because it and Pfizer had already created versions of their established vaccine to target the earlier Alpha and Delta variants, with clinical trials continuing.However, the debate appears to have shifted as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement on Friday that international regulators now preferred clinical studies to be carried out before approval of a new vaccine.These studies should show that neutralising antibodies in the blood of participants are superior to those elicited by current vaccines. Another desired feature of an upgraded vaccine would be for it to also protect against other variants of concern, the EMA said.The Omicron variant has replaced the Delta variant as the dominant lineage in many parts of the world and Omicron itself is now splitting into different subforms, one of which, BA2, is causing particular concern. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"us in talks with energy producers about alternative gas supplies for europe","story":"US president Joe Biden  and Russian president Vladimir Putin. Photograph: Mandel Ngan, Mikhail MetzelSputnikAFPUS president Joe Biden has said he would consider imposing sanctions on the Russian leader Vladimir Putin if he orders an invasion of Ukraine.The president again on Tuesday maintained there would be “serious economic consequences “ for Russia if it sent troops into Ukraine.Asked whether he could see Mr Putin himself becoming a target for sanctions, Mr Biden replied: “Yes. I would see that.”Earlier senior Biden administration officials signalled that there would not be a phased response from the US to any Russian invasion of Ukraine.“That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there. We’ve made efforts to signal this intention very clearly.“And I would say the deepening sell-off in Russian markets, its borrowing costs, the value of its currency, market-implied default risk reflect the severity of the economic consequences we can and will impose on the Russian economy in the event of a further invasion,” a senior official said.In addition to any financial sanctions, the US is also looking at the imposition “novel export controls that would deal Putin a weak strategic hand over the medium term”.These would include sophisticated technologies that are designed and produced in the United States.“If you step back and look at the global dominance of US-origin software, technology, and tooling, the export control options we’re considering alongside our allies and partners would hit Putin’s strategic ambitions to industrialise his economy quite hard.“And it would impair areas that are of importance to him, whether it’s in artificial intelligence or quantum computing, or defence, or aerospace, or other key sectors.”“While our actions and the EU’s actions may not be identical, we are unified in our intention to impose massive consequences that would deliver a severe and immediate blow to Russia and over time make its economy even more brittle and undercut Putin’s aspirations to exert influence on the world stage,” one senior official said.Gas suppliesThe Biden administration also believes that any move by Mr Putin to restrict or withhold gas supplies to western Europe as part of any conflict over Ukraine could also hurt the Russian economy.“This is a one-dimensional economy, and that means it needs oil and gas revenues at least as much as Europe needs its energy supply.”“So remember, oil and gas export revenues are two-thirds of the total in Russia and about half of Russia’s federal budget revenues. So this is not an asymmetric advantage for Putin it’s an interdependency.”The Biden administration also indicated that it was in talks with major energy-producing countries and companies around the world over a potential ersion of supplies to Europe if Russia invaded Ukraine and its gas exports were restricted or blocked.“We’re working with countries and companies around the world to ensure the security of supply and to mitigate against price shocks affecting both the American people and the global economy. ““A disruption in the physical energy supplies transiting Ukraine would, clearly, most acutely affect natural gas markets in Europe. And so we’re engaging our European allies to coordinate our response planning, including talking to them how they deploy their existing energy stockpiles, which are, obviously, at significantly low levels this year due to the reduced Russian supplies over the last several months.”A senior official said the Biden administration had been working “to identify additional volumes of non-Russian natural gas from various areas of the world -- from North Africa and the Middle East to Asia and the United States”.“Correspondingly, we’re in discussions with major natural gas producers around the globe to understand their capacity and willingness to temporarily surge natural gas output and to allocate these volumes to European buyers.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris survives mess needs start governing conservative","story":"In the old silent movies, the hero used to extricate himself from his predicament accompanied by the words “with one bound he was free”. The phrase could serve as the political motto of Boris Johnson, dubbed the Great Houdini for confounding previous predictions of his demise.He awoke yesterday morning to find the front pages and TV news broadcasts focusing on a celebration of his birthday during lockdown in apparent breach of the rules. That’s it, said the pundits. All over. Yet by the end of the day, things didn’t look so clear cut.Ms Gray is said to have found prima facie evidence that eight parties breached lockdown regulations, which could result in fines for those involved, possibly even the Prime Minister. Were that to happen it might galvanise Tory MPs into firing off the 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote.With anger running high with the incessant drip-drip of allegations, Mr Johnson’s best hope of survival is for Tory MPs to shy away from the dislocation that would be caused by a leadership contest. In truth, he is less a Houdini than a Mr Micawber, always confident that something will turn up. Indeed, it already has with the threatened invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Mr Johnson took the chance to make a statesmanlike appearance in the Commons yesterday to call for Western unity in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression.In this he was performing the proper task of the Prime Minister but it allowed him neatly to contrast “Cakegate” with the stark realities of a real crisis. Moreover, when Labour’s Angela Rayner raised the latest revelations in the chamber, a claque of Tory backbenchers had been corralled to support Mr Johnson and emphasise the successful vaccine roll-out, the refusal to enforce tough controls during the omicron surge and the strong diplomatic position the UK has adopted over Ukraine.Perhaps the Prime Minister can see a way out of his plight, charting a path across the political quagmire that would see lesser mortals swallowed in the mud. But there are two questions here – not just can he survive but should he? Many say that his integrity and authority have been shot to pieces by the cavalier culture in Downing Street during lockdown, with staff blithely flouting rules the rest of us followed diligently.His supporters maintain it is ridiculous to topple a Prime Minister over such trivial matters. But that is not the point. Many of us felt the rules were disproportionate, but we obeyed them because they were the law of the land. We did so under protest but observed them none the less, in some cases even when it meant not being able to say farewell to dying relatives. It is hard to forgive insouciance in high places while there was such misery elsewhere. The law is not just for little people, as some in No 10 appeared to believe.However, the fact that there is now a police probe is not of itself a reason to resign. Tony Blair was interviewed twice in 2007 (though not under caution) in connection with the “cash for honours” scandal. At the time, Labour called it a “passing political hoo-ha”, while the Conservatives demanded Blair’s resignation “in the national interest”. Plus ca change...The parallel with Mr Blair is not an auspicious one for Mr Johnson, as the Labour leader left office a few months later to avoid a leadership challenge. Can the Tories engineer something similar, a deal to let Mr Johnson remain in No 10 before standing down later this year or early next? That would require the Prime Minister to agree and he shows no inclination to do so.Then there is the argument that, with war looming in eastern Europe, now is not the time to defenestrate a Prime Minister. In fact, there is a long history of getting rid of leaders in a time of conflict. Lloyd George replaced Asquith in 1916 and Chamberlain was pushed aside by Churchill in 1940. More recently, in November 1990, thousands of British troops had already been deployed to the Gulf when Mrs Thatcher was forced out by a Cabinet putsch.Mr Johnson seemingly retains the support of his top team – or at least no one has resigned as he did from Theresa May’s Cabinet, precipitating the crisis that led to her downfall. But the big question is this: if he manages to slither out of his immediate predicament, to what purpose? The eminent office he occupies does not exist simply to provide a vehicle for his greater glory. He remains Prime Minister under sufferance of his MPs who expect him to lead a government that is both competent and Conservative.More from News Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine latest news: Russia faces \u0026#39severe economic costs\u0026#39 if it invades, warns Liz TrussUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"burns night blunder scottish government makes gaelic translation","story":"Her government spends millions of pounds a year promoting Gaelic and has ensured the language is plastered over everything from emergency vehicles to road signs.But Nicola Sturgeon’s administration was left red-faced on Burns Night after publishing an embarrassing translation error as Scots all over the world gathered to celebrate the country’s national bard.An official Scottish government social media account wished Scots all over the world “Oidhche Losgadh Sona”, in what was supposed to be a translation of “Happy Burns Night” on Tuesday, alongside an image of a traditional supper of haggis, neeps and tatties.However, the patriotic tweet, issued to almost 5,000 followers by the nationalist government’s devolved rural affairs department, backfired when it emerged that “Losgadh” was not Robert Burns’ Gaelic surname but the word for a physical injury caused by heat or chemicals.And while some names do have Gaelic translations, this does not apply to Burns, Gaelic language experts confirmed, and speculated that a hapless official had merely typed the greeting into Google Translate before publishing it to the world.Donald Cameron, a Scottish Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands who took his parliamentary oath in Gaelic last May, said: “Whoever was responsible will be sat eating their haggis with a bit of a red face tonight.“It is just as well Burns showed more attention to detail in his works, than this official did in this tweet.”In its most recent budget, the Scottish government committed £25.3 million in taxpayers’ cash to Gaelic learning and a further £3 million to a “Gaelic Capital Fund”. Last year, it published a 48-page Gaelic plan, in which it hailed the language as “an integral part of Scotland’s heritage, national identity and current cultural life”.A devoted Gaelic government agency, Bòrd na Gàidhlig, is based in Inverness and is tasked with overseeing the plan.Among their roles is to advise the Scottish government on “Gaelic issues”.Another of its missions is to “influence national and international events and celebrations… to ensure Gaelic is featured prominently.”However, it appeared that civil servants had failed to consult an expert at the agency, which employs the equivalent of 19 full-time workers. The tweet was swiftly deleted after the error was pointed out by Roger Hutchinson, an author and journalist.He tweeted: “So glad the Scottish government has a salaried Gaelic officer, who trusts Google Translate to know the difference between heat burns (losgadh) and the surname Burns (Burns).”More from News Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine latest news: Russia faces \u0026#39severe economic costs\u0026#39 if it invades, warns Liz TrussUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parsimony past rebuke todays state spendthrifts2","story":"An extra 20 minutes of spending on the NHS, perhaps?

It’s all thanks to the National Fund, set up in 1928, with an anonymous £500,000 donation, to accept money from wealthy benefactors.The idea was that, via compound interest and new contributions, the National Fund would one day build up into enough money to pay off the debt in full. Now, however, it seems that this objective has been judged so ludicrously far-fetched that it can be put to one side and the Government can have the money.Legally, this is probably right. The National Fund has grown to £600 million. But given that the national debt is now £2.2 trillion, or £72,000 per taxpayer, and is rising at £5,170 per second, even if the whole fund had been put into Apple shares 30 years ago there is no way it was ever going to pay off the vast sums the state has borrowed. And yet morally, the decision was surely a mistake.The fund was a monument to a happier time when we had a better sense of what government borrowing actually meant. It was a reminder that, 90 years ago, people actually trusted that their money would not be wasted by the government – so much so that they were willing to donate more than they owed in tax to an endeavour designed to alleviate the burden on taxpayers. As quaint as the notion might appear to today’s politicians, it also told us that the debt was once seen as deeply embarrassing – taken on to fight the Great War, but that like a mortgage it would need to be paid back one day, and that we might even aspire to run a surplus, and put some money aside for a rainy day (or a pandemic, come to think of it).Perhaps most importantly, the fund was a permanent rebuke to the kind of fashionable economists who argue that more borrowing and more debt is a good thing in itself, irrespective of how wisely the government spends the cash, and that we can keep on printing more money and taking it onto the government’s books forever without any consequences. The anonymous donor in 1928 didn’t believe that, and neither did the other contributors over the years. Their views should carry more weight than they do today.Another £600 million is not going to keep the Chancellor, and even less his free-spending neighbour, going for more than a few days at most. If it could be used for current spending, it would be lost in the accounts.So we should be keeping the money exactly where it is. Even better, we should give it a website and a Twitter feed and open it to fresh donations. Like the calorie counters on restaurant menus, or those flashing signs that tell you are over the speed limit, it would be a gentle reminder that discipline, frugality, and paying your bills on time, are all valuable qualities, and while we may not always live up to those values, we should at least try. If we could re-learn that, it would be £600 million well spent.More from News Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsUkraine latest news: Liz truss calls on allies to \u0026#39do more\u0026#39 to pressure RussiaJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"traditional phrases sent knackers yard survey finds under 50s","story":"People who pepper their speech with traditional phrases may find they are casting their pearls before swine, after new research found that dozens of sayings are at risk of dying out.Phrases such as “nail your colours to the mast” and “know your onions” were among those barely used by modern speakers, according to the survey of 2,000 adults aged between 18 and 50.Asked if they had ever used dozens of historical phrases, 78 per cent said they had never used the phrase “pearls before swine”, which has its origins in the Bible and was used by both Shakespeare and Dickens. A further 71 per cent had never used “nail your colours to the mast” and 64 per cent “a stitch in time saves nine”.At the less endangered end of the spectrum, 51 per cent of respondents said they had never uttered the phrase “see a man about a dog” and 49 per cent said “snug as a bug in a rug” had never crossed their lips. Not all the at-risk phrases are likely to pass muster among younger generations. Pronouncing the words “knickers in a twist” or “colder than a witch’s t--” might cause a conversation quickly to go pear-shaped.The English language continually evolves. Jealousy and envy were once very distinct words - one could not be jealous of something one did not already possess. Nevertheless, those surveyed expressed disappointment at the disappearance of old sayings, even if they would need to Google them first. In the survey, 73 per cent of those asked said that it was a shame when a phrase died out. Ellie Glason, from Perspectus Global, which commissioned the poll, said: It\u0027s interesting to see from our research, how language evolves and changes over the years.It would seem that many of the phrases which were once commonplace in Britain are seldom used nowadays.(Percentage of recipients who never use the phrase)More from NewsUkraine latest news: Liz Truss calls on allies to \u0026#39do more\u0026#39 to pressure Russia Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel test firm ordered pay refunds holidaymakers","story":"A travel test firm has been ordered to pay refunds to holidaymakers after failing to provide them with swab results or kits. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the competition watchdog, has revealed that it has secured an agreement from Dante Labs that it will pay any outstanding refunds within 21 days.The watchdog also disclosed the company had already paid out to thousands of customers who were let down by delayed or lost results or kits.The company has also been lambasted for misleading information about its tests and failing to provide a proper customer service system that responded to complaints and queries in a “helpful and timely way”.Andrea Coscelli, chief executive at the CMA, said: “No PCR testing firm is exempt from the rules, and our action to secure these refunds and other changes shows that we will not tolerate poor business practices.“While travel rules to the UK may have changed, those people who still require PCR tests to travel abroad shouldn’t have to waste money on late results or tests that don’t arrive.“It is crucial that all PCR providers treat people fairly, being clear on price and timings and providing refunds where they are due.”Dante Labs, a US-headquartered company, is the sister company to Immensa Health Clinics Ltd, which was investigated after potentially issuing more than 40,000 false-negative tests.Recent comments on Trustpilot have slated the company. One, posted on January 13, said: “Never received my PCR test result - this is now more than 3 weeks later. Do not trust this company and do not give them your money.”Another customer, who posted on January 9, said that he had to wait a week for a day two test result, requiring him to self-isolate during that time. It meant he had to cancel a hospital examination for which he had been waiting a year and abandon a booster jab.“I couldn’t go to work and lost money. Meanwhile, the law changed and people arriving after me didn’t even have to isolate while waiting for the result,” said the customer.The CMA has carried out investigations into three test providers, including Dante Labs. The CMA has also sent letters to 25 PCR test providers, warning them to review their terms and conditions – and other practices – or risk enforcement action. The CMA action follows the announcement on Monday that all tests will be scrapped for vaccinated travellers while those for the unjabbed will be reduced to pre-departure and PCR day tests.Dante Labs has been contacted for comment.More from NewsUkraine latest news: Liz truss calls on allies to \u0026#39do more\u0026#39 to pressure Russia Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"truth joe biden can no longer ignored","story":"Over the years, shoals of public figures have fallen prey to the snare of the hot mic. Obama and Sarkozy were famously caught moaning about Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011. “I cannot stand him. He’s a liar,” muttered Sarkozy. “You’re fed up with him?” retorted Obama, “I have to deal with him every day!” Gordon Brown’s “bigoted woman” gaffe prompted a row that all but destroyed his political career, and who could forget Prince Charles’s comments about Nicholas Witchell on the ski slopes of Klosters? Yet such moments can be as revealing as they are funny – and often as destructive.This week provided another hot mic for the ages. On Monday, President Biden was addressing a meeting held by the White House Competition Council, a group that works, among other things, to help consumers deal with higher prices. A laudable aim, you might say, with US inflation at a four-decade high – itself a compelling topic to reporters. But not, apparently, if you’re Joe Biden.The President had yet again refused to take media questions, so at the end of the session, reporters began yelling them out instead, hoping for an off-the-cuff response. “Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?”, tried Peter Doocy of Fox News. The President responded sarcastically, apparently oblivious to the still-running cameras and microphone.“It’s a great asset, more inflation… What a stupid son of a b----”, he scoffed, half petulant teenager, half pub bore being reluctantly kicked out at closing time.Such moments should be more remarkable than they are, yet Biden has committed so many faux pas that they barely count as “gaffes” these days. Last week, he lashed out at a reporter who pressed him on remarks suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine might prompt a lesser comeback from the US than a full-scale invasion. “Why are you waiting on Putin to make the first move, sir?” asked Jacqui Heinrich of Fox News. “What a stupid question”, Biden chuckled.The crumbling of Biden’s once-convivial facade is a particular surprise, marking, as it does, the destruction of one of the President’s few remaining virtues. In his inaugural address, he pledged to heal a bitterly-ided country – vowing to “end this uncivil war which pits reds against blue”, promising “decency, honour, respect, treating people with dignity.” This was the kindly grandfather who would unite a nation with a new brand of grown-up, moderate politics – and restore America’s reputation after the chaos of the Trump years. The last year has certainly disabused voters of that fond vision.Biden’s personal approval ratings are the lowest at this stage of any modern presidency besides Trump’s – and they have plummeted from a greater polling height than his isive predecessor ever managed. First, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan scorched Biden’s “competency” selling-point, then his radical domestic agenda (plus the surging criminality visible in many Democrat-controlled cities) harmed claims of “moderation”. On a host of issues – lockdowns, higher taxes, open borders, law and order – Democrats sit well to the Left of the US public. And now his administration’s testy reactions to criticism are upending the much-vaunted “nice guy” persona, too.White House press secretary Jen Psaki has become famous for her scathing put-downs to reporters’ questions (gushingly nicknamed “Psaki bombs” by fans). Yet witnessing her in action gives an overwhelming sense of sneering condescension that same tendency to shrug off inconvenient questions. She recently laughed off a query about how the Government was preparing for the winter supply chain crunch, by dismissing a crisis affecting everything from medical supplies to food as “the tragedy of the treadmill that’s delayed”. Such a remark isn’t just crass it suggests either an astonishing ignorance about voters’ lives and concerns – or something closer to contempt.Fake news appears to be thriving in the Biden administration, too. Just last week, Psaki name-checked Florida as an example of a state that had “done little” to distribute state funds to keep schools open. This was an odd choice with or without federal help, Florida has remained open for in-person instruction since August 2020, while many Democrat-run areas still cleave to remote teaching. Why, exactly, did Psaki single Florida out? Was it because the state has challenged mask and vaccine mandates, and other draconian rules imposed nationally, or simply that Democrats see its popular governor Ron DeSantis as a threat?The old game – ”imagine what the press would have said if Trump had done X” – may be something of a fish-in-barrel exercise now, but it’s inconceivable that such craven tactics would receive such glancing media treatment.On the rare occasions they are scrutinised, the Biden team usually ducks accountability by citing the hand they were dealt by Trump. Rarely do they take responsibility for their errors, or show any sign of reflecting on how their policy machinery might have led them there. Not being Trump was always Biden’s biggest selling-point, but as his administration lunges from one crisis to another, it appears to be all they have left.More from NewsUkraine latest news: Liz truss calls on allies to \u0026#39do more\u0026#39 to pressure Russia Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two thirds people catch omicron have already had covid study","story":"Two thirds of the people infected with omicron have previously already had the Covid virus, a major new study suggests.Imperial College London’s REACT-1 study sent out 100,000 Covid tests to people around England and asked them fill in a questionnaire.One question is if the person taking the swab has had Covid before, and if this was confirmed with a test, or was just a suspected case.More than 3,500 people who tested positive between January 5 and January 20 answered this question, and almost two-thirds (64.5 per cent) said they had previously tested positive for coronavirus.A further 7.5 per cent said they suspected they had caught the virus previously, but had not received a positive test.Prof Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme and chairman in Epidemiology and Public Health Medicine at Imperial College London, said these can not be technically labelled as reinfections, because it is possible some cases are residual infections, where a person has simply tested positive twice for the same infection.“They may have had a positive test for omicron, for all I know, in December, and then got tested by us,” he said.“We don\u0027t know when they had it, it could have been in May 2020, or last week.”It has been known that omicron is more able to infect people who have previously had Covid-19 than other variants, due to an innate ability to dodge the immune system.As a result, reinfections have gone from accounting for a miniscule proportion of all infections, to a sizable chunk.The latest UK Health Security Agency figures show 11 per cent of all cases were reinfections, but the new study indicates the true figure may be much higher.However, reinfections are not included in the current daily case figures, an oversight which is now set to be corrected as the UKHSA announced on Tuesday reinfections in England will be included in daily cases from January 31 onwards.A reinfection will be defined as a person testing positive twice, at least 90 days apart, and the daily figures will be updated back to the start of the pandemic.Imperial’s study also confirmed that the prevalence of Covid reached an all-time high earlier this month, peaking at more than four per cent of the population, equivalent to around one infected person per 23 people.Almost all of the positive tests detected though the study were omicron, completely replacing delta.But throughout January, REACT detected an overall decrease in the total number of infections, and a potential recent plateau.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: “It’s reassuring to see Covid-19 infections beginning to slow across the country, as we move back to Plan A.“Covid-19 rates are still high so as we learn to live with the virus it is vital we continue to be vigilant – wash your hands, let in fresh air, get tested and, if you haven’t already, get boosted now.”The study comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveal deaths in England are currently 4.1 per cent below the pre-pandemic average for this time of year.Data show there were 534 fewer deaths registered in the week ending January 14 in England compared to the 2015-2019 average.Dr Raghib Ali, an epidemiologist and NHS consultant, said there was no evidence that the omicron wave was causing excess deaths and that it was clear many “Covid” patients in hospital were incidental cases who had been admitted for other reasons.“Compared with previous waves, we’re no longer seeing excess deaths at the same time as Covid deaths,” he said.“I think we’ve passed the peak of this wave on all parameters, cases, admissions and deaths. Schools have been back for three weeks now and there has been a slight uptick but I can’t see any scenario where things get worse from here.“So it’s safe for Plan B restrictions to be removed, and there is little difference they make much difference anyway. England’s death rates are lower than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland despite not imposing such stringent restrictions.“It’s fair to say that hospitals are not as busy with Covid as feared and staff absences are now improving.”More from News Boris Johnson latest news: Sue Gray \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report still not handed to Downing Street as PM to face MPsJacob Rees-Mogg says general election needed if Boris Johnson ousted over partygateUkraine latest news: Russia faces \u0026#39severe economic costs\u0026#39 if it invades, warns Liz TrussUkraine crisis: Why Russia might invade and what could happen nextAustralia Day 2022: Everything you need to know about the annual celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"primary school kids left socially","story":"Primary school kids left socially three years behind post-Covid, headteacher saysTeachers also told the Education Select Committee catch-up tutors were not always well trained to build relationships with vulnerable pupils or help the youngest children with their reading Image: Getty Images WestendByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Jan | commentsThe sheer number of Covid absences has left some primary school kids two or three years behind in development, a headteacher has said. Since the pandemic begun, children have been struggling to maintain a rhythm with their education but it has been hard for many, teachers told the Education Committee. But headteachers fear their social development has been neglected.Jill Thompson headteacher of Kelvin Grove Primary School, Gateshead told the Committee the youngest children in her school have had so much of their le isolated thanks to the pandemic.Often weaposre seeing children responding emotionally, two years younger than they should. So in our reception and our nurseries weaposre seeing this, particularlywe do not get social development and child development right, Ms Thompson said. Her comments came as other teaches said catch-up tutors were inconsistent with helping kids catch up with lost learning. Under the Government’s flagship tutoring scheme to help pupils catch up, headteachers said that tutors were not always well trained to build relationships with vulnerable pupils or help the youngest children with their reading. Ruth Holden, executive headteacher of Mulberry Academy Shoreditch in east London, told the Commons’ education select committee: “We found the National Tutoring Programme iable, really iable, and quite inconsistent.” She said: “Some of those people were very good in terms of their specialism but they weren’t necessarily very good with children, particularly children who need a particular style of engagement, because they aren’t very able, or had connectivity issues or a whole host of things to do with deprivation.”  A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are determined to support children from all backgrounds to catch up on lost learning and reach their potential.” “High quality tuition is key to the delivery of the National Tutoring Programme and there are a range of measures in place including ensuring tutors have appropriate qualications and experience, along with training in safeguarding, to ensure all Tutoring Partners involved in the programme meet those standards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsNurseries\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From April the minimum Universal Credit rate will be around £ a week for over-s, with top-ups for those with housing needs, children and disabilities. But the Commission, whose leaders all say they have “lived experience of the benefits system”, say this should be scrapped and replaced by a new system. Central to it would be a ‘Guaranteed Decent Income’ of £. a week for all adults, including multiple adults in the same household. This is similar to a Universal Basic Income, but instead of being paid to all adults rich and poor, would target those whose earnings slip below the £. threshold or who don’t earn at all.  Child benefit would be set at £ a week, more than double the £. for the eldest child now, and Personal Independence Payment for the disabled would range from £. to £.. The plans were drawn up by the Commission, an organisation that looks at radical reform of the benefit system and is funded by inequality campaign group Trust for London.  The plans are not costed but Commission secretary Michael Orton claimed they would be a “post-war”-style investment that paid for itself through savings in other areas and a more healthy and prosperous society. Dr Orton, of the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University, said: “The pandemic showed that when times were tough it was unpaid carers, supermarket workers and others on low incomes who kept our society going. It also showed thatwe choose to, we can provide social security for everyone. “However, the recent cut to Universal Credit means the government is headed in the wrong direction. With a cost of living crisis looming in , it doesn’t have to be like this.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Minimum wageChild benefitBenefitsDepartment for Work and Pensions\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now the Mirror has learned the report release date could be this week after allWhitehall enforcer Sue Gray Image: PAByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Top civil servant Sue Gray has been investigating a string of alleged lockdown-busting parties across Downing Street and Whitehall. But the release date of her report was thrown into chaos today after the Met Police also announced it would investigate “a number of” gatherings to seethey broke the law. Boris Johnson - who has said heaposs willing to be interviewed by police - was told about the development before it was revealed by Scotland Yard’s Commissioner Cressida Dick.At first it seemed Sue Gray’s report could be split in two - one part paused, to let police investigate, and then another part published in truncated form on any parties not probed by police.But the Mirror understands events are moving extremely quickly and the Cabinet Office is now in talks about publishing the entire report, in a matter of days, after all.  Here is what we understand as of the afternoon of Tuesday  January….What is the Sue Gray report Top civil servant Sue Gray is investigating a string of parties in Whitehall between May  and April  - mostly in  Downing Street and its garden.The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her inquiry has been set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. But its remit does not include saying whether the PM broke the lawor the Ministerial Code . When is the Sue Gray report due Sue Gray had been due to publish a report this week on what she found.But that nowmighthave been scuppered by the Met Police announcing it is also investigating a number of the parties from  .Sue Gray’s terms of reference said: “If during the course of the work any evidence emerges of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, the matter will be referred to the police and the Cabinet Office’s work may be paused.” However - the Mirror understands the Cabinet Office is still discussing what,anything, will be paused, and there are several possible outcomes.Will the Sue Gray report be split into two parts We thought it would be, but thataposs now looking less likely.Essentially, as of this lunchtime, No thought Sue Gray would only be able to carry on investigating - and publish a report on - any party that police werenotinvestigating. She would have to “pause” work on any party that policewereinvestigating.This would essentially split her report into two - one report due imminently, and one report that could be weeks or months away depending on when Scotland Yard finish. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said No wonapost publish anything that relates to the work of the police, but can continue to work on allegations that do not reach the police threshold. However…. it looks like this has already changed since the No briefing at .am. Why might the Sue Gray report be published in full after all The Mirror understands the situation is now moving fast after today’s police announcement. Since the No briefing this lunchtime, sources in Scotland Yard said the force would, in fact, not object to the publishing of Sue Gray’s report. While there is always the possibility of a police investigation being pre-empted, police are more relaxed because they have obtained much of their information from Sue Gray herself. And crucially the penalty for breaching lockdown rules is a fixed penalty notice, which means it’s highly unlikely to prejudice a jury. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said he saw no legal reason why Sue Gray’s report should not be published. It’s understood the Cabinet Office have been in talks with the police to work out whether Scotland Yard is, indeed, happy to have a full report out in the public domain. A government source said these talks will “go a long way” to helping Sue Gray’s team decide what can be published. The Times reported that Scotland Yard had given the green light for publication as of pm on Tuesday.So when will the report release date actually be The situation is very fluid, but the Mirror has been told despite all the drama, Sue Gray’s report - either the full thing or a truncated version- could be published as soon as tomorrow. A government source said No getting hold of the report could happen as quickly as today.If so, the report could be published on Wednesday just before PMQs.What does it all mean for Boris Johnson The timing and nature of the report is crucial for Boris Johnson because it could affect his own MPs trying to topple him as Prime Minister.  Tory MPs need to send no confidence letters to trigger a leadership challenge, and many were waiting for the outcome of Sue Gray’s report before deciding whether to send a letter. A partial report would mean Tory MPs were hamstrung on whether or not to vote no confidence in their leader. But a full report would mean they could safely reach a conclusion on whether he should be ousted. One Tory elected in  told the Mirror things had “quietened down in the past week”, adding: “Sometimes you get to the precipice, look over and go ‘aagh!’. “Most of the Tory MPs Iaposve spoken to in the last few days seem to think he will get through it.” But they warned: “People are not so much waiting for the Sue Gray report as for how the Prime Minister responds afterwards.”What  could happen Some lawyers have questioned whether the incidents may be examples of malfeasance or misconduct in public office or neglect of duty. If police consider such offences that could lead to a prosecution on more serious charges which may result in a prison sentence. There is also speculation over whether the probe could open the door to possible action for perverting the course of justice,officers discover those involved lied or tried to conceal evidence.

As Boris Johnson scraps restrictions to save his own skin, we need to convince everyone to get a Covid jab. And that means hitting them where it hurtsA woman gets a Covid jab in Kent Image: Grant Falvey LNPopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsGet jabbed, or . It sounds harsh – and it is – but the time has come where it’s essential. Because we’re on our own now. Boris Johnson is forcing people to pay for his career with their health and, inevitably, in some cases their lives. To please his right-wingers and try to cling to power he’s dropping most Covid restrictions from tomorrow, to the alarm of the scientic and medical communities.Even isolation after a positive test will apparently be scrapped by March. It’s unlikely this government will bring back restrictions ever again, no matter what. The best thing we can do to protect ourselves is get vaccinated and boosted. Then your chances of catching Covid are reduced, but evenyou do, you’re much less likely be seriously ill, or – crucially for society – to spread it to others.  “If everyone who was offered a vaccine and booster would take it, the pandemic would be effectively over in richer countries,” claries the consistently reliable Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Getting vaccinated is good for us personally, and for everyone  too. It is the very clear way out. What’s not to love  The Get Boosted campaign was a start, but now it needs to go a stage further. The vaccine hesitant – those who are afraid, because they’ve genuinely fallen for untrue propaganda – need to be persuaded. The ­militant, rabid anti-vaxxers will never be persuaded, so they need to be forced. No excuses. Too many people who happily put meals containing who-knows-what chemicals into their bodies, or those who ingest recreational drugs cut with let’s-not-even-go-there have said they won’t have the jab because they don’t know what’s in it. Unless you’re a food chemist or a drug dealer, no one knows what’s in anything! The vaccine has been tested and proven. Get jabbed, or . French President Emmanuel Macron ’s strategy is to “p*** off” the unvaccinated by making daily le more and more dficult for them. Tres bien, but not far enough. The unvaccinated must become social pariahs. They shouldn’t be allowed into indoor communal spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, gigs and – yup, the most bitter of all blows – pubs.Why should those of us who are jabbed and boosted have to risk breathing in their maskless air  If they don’t like it, they know exactly what they can do about it. Perhaps we should even make unvaccinated patients pay for the NHS care they are statistically so much more likely to need after refusing their jabs  Maybe the money should go directly into the pockets of the exhausted doctors and nurses who will have to treat them, seeing as they’ve unnecessarily added to their back-breaking workload. This tough love, cruel-to-be-kind tactic really is our only option now. We’ve tried personal responsibility, arguing and attempting to reason with brainwashed Facebookers. Enough. Get jabbed, or .

Brits are proving keen to head to traditional hotspots like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Mr Heapy said: Before yesterdayaposs announcement demand was already strong, however bookings have jumped by another % when compared with the previous week, demonstrating just how much of a game-changer the removal of all testing is for fully vaccinated holidaymakers.  With international travel starting to look like it did before the pandemic, customers are jumping at the chance to book their flights and holidays. Andrew Flintham, managing director at tour operator Tui, said the announcement was a huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal. He went on: The relaxation of testing rules has already resulted in an increase in bookings, with customer confidence growing every day in recent weeks. We now look to the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to adopt the same approach. Many families look to go on holiday over the February half-term, so we are delighted these changes will come into effect in time. Going abroad will finally start to feel more normal again and without the added expense of testing.  Mr Flintham said he expects holidays bookings for this summer to be back to pre-pandemic levels.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claimed the change in rules will bring international travel back to the good old days.The Cabinet minister told LBC: You will be able to come to this country, andyouaposve been fully vaccinated, in other words two vaccinations, you will not need to take any tests at all, either before you leave to come here or when you get back here. Of course, no quarantine. In other words, kind of back to the good old days. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye welcomed the easing of restrictions for people arriving in the UK, but warned many destinations still require travellers to take tests. He told Sky News: We need to get the tests lted at the other end of the journey, because for most countries you might need to go to you will still need testing before youaposre allowed into those countries. So thataposs something weaposll work on. Among the destinations which require arrivals from the UK to take a Covid test, eventhey are fully vaccinated, are Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Morocco, mainland Portugal, Switzerland and the US. The UKaposs most popular foreign holiday destination, Spain, does not require testing, but only fully vaccinated visitors are permitted to enter. Meanwhile figures from the Office for National Statisticsshow the number of deaths involving Covid registered each week in England and Wales has climbed to its highest level for  months.A total of , deaths registered in the week ending January  mentioned Covid- on the death certicate, according to the ONS.That is up % on the previous seven days and is the highest number since , deaths were registered in the week to March  .

David Thompson and Jessica Morris, who both suffer from mental health conditions, are unable to work - and have no money to rent a property, YorkshireLive report.The pair have now been forced to spend the freezing winter months in a dirty tent in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, with no access to warm water. They spend their days with dogs, Blaze and Marcel, in the cramped tent in the Valley View campsite. The couple say Kirklees Council have left them living in terrible conditions after going back on their promise. We told the council we would be moving up and they told us they would help us find suitable accommodation, said David, , who lives with ADHD and depression. They have since told us there is nowhere suitable for us because we have got the dogs. It makes so many things harder - we donapost have a fridge, so we canapost keep our food or things like milk for longer than two days. We are dealing with rain coming into the tent because itaposs all ripped and we also have mould. Itaposs not good for us but we canapost do anything  really.

The -year-old added the couple are hoping to attend a house viewing set up by the council on February . A Kirklees Council spokesperson told : “Tackling rough sleeping is one of the Council’s key priorities. We have a rough sleeping team dedicated to working with those in urgent need of help, including offering temporary accommodation where appropriate, but this offer is not always taken-up for ious reasons.“It is not always possible to house dogs in temporary accommodation, but we always work to find temporary foster care for pets whilst their owners await permanent re-housing.“In this case, both services were offered whilst the couple were being matched to a suitable property.“A long-term home has now been found and, once the property has undergone repairs, will be ready for them to view.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON David ThompsonCare homesMental healthNursing homesAnimalsADHDTown Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They were messaging on their Microsoft Teams work chat – not text or WhatsApp, as I guess it’s far less likely anyone would find those messages. I grew suspicious because he kept talking about this woman in glowing terms, saying how great she is at her job and how young and energetic she is. “Amazing” is a word he used a lot to describe her. She’s  years younger than he is and is also married!There was nothing overtly sexual about the messages, but they were flirtatious and intimate.They were also arranging to meet up after work to play squash and have dinner. I was so shocked – we’ve been together for more than  years and I never imagined I couldn’t trust him. It seems so out of character. I’d love your opinion on next steps. Coleen saysWell, the first thing you need to ask yourself is do you want to stay with him and try to make the marriage work If the answer is yes, then you have to ask him why he’s looking for another woman to provide something in his le. What’s your relationship lacking and why isn’t he talking to you about it  This kind of thing is so hurtful – it is a betrayal of your relationship. And he was obviously “hiding” the messages, thinking that you’d never go snooping on his work devices. I do think this is a symptom of a relationship that’s struggling, so it’s important to be really honest with each other. You need to work through what’s gone wrong and to seethere’s anything to build on. Maybe the best route to help you do this is relationship counselling.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageCheatingRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Drivers are likely to face fines and points on their licencethey fail to adhere to the amended rules, which are being implemented across the UK.Department for Transport is enforcing a new aposhierarchy of road usersapos from Saturday January , . It will ensure that pedestrians and cyclists face greater protection on roads and at crossings.The new guidelines are split into three categories, all with a focus on making roads safer for non-drivers. So, hereaposs everything you need to watch out for with the brand new Highway Code rules. What are the new Highway Code  rules  Rule H Hierarchy of Road Users  The Hierarchy of Road Users is the main focus of the Highway Code  rule update and the concept centres around protecting those most at riska road collision occurs. Pedestrians have been identied as the most vulnerable group, leading to their place being at the top of the new structure.The Highway Code outlines that cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists are also part of this group. It also highlights children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk.Therefore, the new hierarchy structure will lead to road users - who have the ability to cause the most harm during collisions - having the greatest responsibility to keep other road users safe.  In particular, the guidelines state that drivers of a selection of vehicles will be facing the most scrutiny on the roads. It states: This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles.A Department for Transport spokesperson told The Mirror: The Department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible. And our well-established THINK! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond. Rule H Pedestrian priority  The  Highway Code update has outlined that drivers, cyclists. drivers, motorcyclists, horse-drawn vehicles and horse riders must now give way to pedestrians who are crossing or waiting to cross the road, at junctions into which or from which you are turning. Previously, vehicles and cyclists were given priority at junctions, but the rules now mean that this is no longer the case. Pedestrians continue to have priority at zebra crossings, and vehicles must give way to cyclists and pedestrians at parallel crossings. Cyclists and drivers must also give way to pedestrians at light-controlled crossings when the green signal appears. Another rule update now means that cyclists need to give way to pedestrians on shared-use cycle tracks. Rule H Cyclist safety  From giving way at roundabouts to overtaking cyclists, a number of rules have been amended to improve cyclist safety as part of the hierarchy restructure. Drivers across the UK are now advised not to cut across cyclists, horse riders or horse-drawn vehicles when turning in or out of junctions, or changing lanes. In a huge shakeup to the rules, the  guideline amends also mean drivers must now give cyclists priority at roundabouts under Rule . It now states: You should give priority to cyclists on the roundabout. They will be travelling more slowly than motorised traffic.  Give them plenty of room and do not attempt to overtake them within their lane. Allow them to move across your path as they travel around the roundabout. Cyclists must, however, stay in the left-hand lane, while signalling right to ensure they alert driversthey arenapost leaving the roundabout at the next turning. All the other  Highway Code rule updates you need to know Overtaking other road users While previous guidance stated drivers needed to give cyclists aposas much room as possibleapos when overtaking, Rule  has now been updated.  The guidance is now as follows: Leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists at speeds of up to mph. Give them more space when overtaking at higher speeds. When it comes to horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles, drivers must now not exceed speeds of mph and there should be at least two metres of space. Drivers should also leave a minimum of two metres of space when passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road. Cyclist road positioning  Cyclists may now drive in the middle of a lane, in order to make themselves as visible as possible. However, they are to move to the left of the laneit is safe and the following applies:Cyclists are on a quiet road or street and a faster vehicle approaches Cyclists are in slower-moving traffic that then speeds up, in order to allow for faster vehicles overtaking Cyclists are in an area of a junction where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake youTurning Left Rule , which previously advised cyclists to keep an eye out for vehicles turning left ahead at a Í›, has now become Rule .  The rule entails cyclists looking out for other cyclists or motorcyclists around them before signalling. They are also encouraged to avoid riding on the inside of vehicles slowing down to turn left or indicating that they are turning left. The new guidance adds: If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the road.  This amendment also highlights the importance of Rule H, and says that cyclists must give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross now. Opening the door A brand new addition to Rule  is new guidance to open your car door in a way that allows you to check for others, highlighted in the new hierarchy, who may be passing.The update reads: Where you are able to do so, you should open the door using your hand on the opposite side to the door you are opening. For example, use your left hand to open a door on your right-hand side. This will make you turn your head to look over your shoulder. Passengers in cars are also instructed to look all around, using their mirrors, before opening the door of their vehicle.

The Primrose Court estate in Huyton, Liverpool, made headlines after a video taken three years ago, describing it as a apossh*tholeapos was posted to Tiktok last week and viewed over  million times. Today little has changed from the scenes in the video, which show windows and doors smashed in or boarded up, burned out houses with the roof missing and enormous piles of trash - some of which has allegedly been there for years. The estate is considered unadopted land by Knowsley Council who say they canapost afford to step in, after developers failed to finish construction of the road and street lighting after they went bust in . Now residents, who are forced to provide their own street lights, have accused the council of being too scared to step in because of trouble from outsiders, who relentlessly fly-tip the street.  One resident who has lived on Primrose Court for four years with his young daughter said outsiders prey on the unadopted street - knowing that without council supervision there will unlikely be consequences for their crimes. He said: “The smashed out windows and burned down houses have been there for years. Itaposs outsiders coming in dumping their rubbish, setting fires in the street and fighting. “If you come again next week it won’t look like this because we’ll have all pitched together to clean it up, but it won’t be long before they come back and dump more rubbish. “Some of the rubbish has been here for years. I think the council needs to do something because that’s the real problem. Nobody owns the street. “Of course it bothers the residents, we don’t want to come out and look at the street like that or come out and see mess everywhere.  But Knowsley Councillor Ken McGlashon claims the problems lie with the landlord who he says told the council and Primrose Court residents at a meeting we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole. He claims the council has suffered a £ million cut to its budget by the government leaving it unable to pick up the bill to fix the estate after the developer failed to hold up their end of the deal. Coun McGlashon said: It’s not a council matter because we don’t own the property.  “It must be horrible for the poor people, I feel sorry for them but what the hell can you dothe developer doesn’t do their job and the council can’t afford to pick up the bill. “This is a quote from the landlord when we met with them “we treat you like s**t because you live in a s**thole”. Thataposs the quote from the landlords themselves. But the majority landlord of Primrose Court has furiously refuted the claim adding that the council has refused to help and is even asking residents for council tax - despite having no involvement in the estate’s maintenance.  Colin Bell, managing director of A Properties, is the acting landlord of  properties in the close, which has  houses in total. Seven of those are derelict and the remaining five others are privately owned. Mr Bell claims that at a meeting with the council in September , council workers agreed that they would initially cover a £, bill to finish the street lights and road, the cost of which would have been repaid by A Properties in full over - years. But he adds that since that meeting, nothing has been done. Mr Bell said: We have over  house and  per cent of our problems come from Primrose Court. We were quoted £, over two and half years ago to put the lighting in and do the road which would have made all the dference.  “The council are saying they can’t afford it but they’re wrong, we were going to pay the council back for those works. I don’t know how a council can’t find £,. Dismissing the councillor’s claims that he ever described the tenants as ‘s**t’, Mr Bell said: “That is an absolute load of rubbish, we are the only landlord there and I certainly havenapost had any meeting with any councillor and said our tenants are s**t. “I think the council has every right to take over those properties and I don’t know why they haven’t done it because they’re short of properties to rent out, they have people on the housing waiting list, and they have these properties that they could have easily taken over… but they haven’t done it.” A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. All of the properties are privately owned. “Many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments. This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed. The current property owners appear to be expecting the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since initial issues arose in the area. A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately, some of the other owners who did not attend that meeting subsequently refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Over a ten-year period, the Knowsley Council has been one of the hardest hit local authorities in the country by Government funding cuts – the Council’s budget has been cut by % and it has had to find £m worth of savings. Funding works to a privately-owned development would not be appropriate, particularly in that context. “In response to the specic comments made by Mr Bell of A Properties, the Council has never agreed to temporarily cover the cost of street lighting or highways works. We have offered to provide support in other ways such as advising on the specication of materials and construction methods, but we have never agreed to cover the cost of the works, temporarily or otherwise. The suggestion that the Council is “too scared” to finish the street lighting is completely untrue – We have simply never agreed to do that work. Council services regularly visit Primrose Court to provide a range of services, such as waste collections, social care, education, housing support, street scene, and environmental health. Our Crime and Communities team has secured funding to install CCTV, once other improvement works have been completed. Just like anybody  in Knowsley, residents pay Council Tax because they access a very wide range of Council services. The dference for residents in Primrose Court is that they have bought or rented houses in a development which was never finished. “We take action against any reported incidents of fly tipping including removal of rubbish and working with our partners and the local community to identy those responsible and pursue enforcement action. In addition, Merseyside Police continue to patrol the area and has conducted a number of search warrants. “Despite the very clear challenges, we continue to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced. The standards at Primrose Court are not acceptable and we remain committed to working with the owners on collaborative solutions to resolve the issues for all concerned.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Council taxHousingKnowsley CouncilCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tragic six-year-old Rikki was strangled and posed naked in a star shape in woodland near his home in Peterborough in November . His mum Ruth Neave was originally accused of his murder but cleared after a trial. The case remained unsolved for more than  years before a cold case review allegedly led to a breakthrough. The DNA of James Watson, who was  at the time of the killing, was found on Rikkiaposs clothes which had been dumped in a wheelie bin, jurors heard. On Tuesday, a former friend of Ms Neave was called to give evidence at Watsonaposs murder trial at the Old Bailey.  Asked to describe her emotional state, Martin Reed said: At the time, she was very, very upset but she swung from moody to angry to tearful. It was just a wide range of emotions. When asked what she was angry about, Mr Reed replied: The fact that it actually happened, that her little boy had been taken. The witness, who gave evidence by video link, said he had not seen Ms Neave since the day of her arrest. He was also askedhe was aware that Ms Neave had an interest in the occult and witchcraft. I knew she had an interest in it ever since I have known her, Mr Reed said.  She was talking about Tarot and dferent things like that. Itaposs all vague recollection. I cannot really remember anything specic. He was then asked said: Were you aware Ruth Neave had written a book, or started a book, about the perfect murder  The witness replied: No, this is the first I have heard about it. The defence barrister went on: Were you aware that she had a great deal of books and magazines at her house about murder and unsolved crimes  Mr Reed replied: I knew she had an interest in murders and unsolved crime, yes, because of the books,theories on certain cases which she discussed. Prosecutors previously asserted that the mum was wrongly accused of involvement in her sonaposs death, with evidence showing she could not have been responsible. Other witnesses have described seeing Watson with Rikki on the Welland Estate in Peterborough on the morning of his disappearance. Watson, now aged , of no fixed address, has denied murder.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderMurder trialCrimeCold Case\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Omicron is believed to be more transmissible than the previous Delta iant, but infection appears to be milder, similar to that of a cold. Now a ‘stealth’ version of the Omicron iant has appeared, leading to fears it could spark further waves of Covid- in the future.The strain, named as Omicron BA., has been classied as a “iant under investigation” by the UKHSA, but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge about the iant. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of Omicron to avoid further spread of infection.  Here we take a look at some of the lesser known symptoms to look out for. What are the symptoms of Omicron The main symptoms of coronavirus are a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell, according to the NHS.However, symptoms of the Omicron iant have been described as milder.According to the ZOE Covid Study, the top five symptoms identied were a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat.There are also other sign to look out for – particularly ones that affect your ears, eyes and head. Vertigo is a symptom that can occur during the “acute” phase of Covid infection, during the recovery process or as part of long Covid symptoms, says the NHS. Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or an altered sense of motion, or lightheadedness.The NHS adds: “Dizziness can also be linked with ringing in the ears, reduced hearing, eye strain and headaches.“These may come and go throughout the day. If they are constant or very intense, you should inform your healthcare professional as they may want to do some further investigations.”  According to the NHS, many studies have shown that Covid may cause headaches. It added: “Some people even get a headache before they notice any breathing problems. It is a common symptom of Covid. “Headaches are often a feature of other viral infections, but for most people the presence of a headache does not always mean that the virus is still present in the body.” According to Dr Konstantina Stankovic, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University, ear pain is becoming a common sign of infection. Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell. These are the officially recognised symptoms according to the NHS. However, with the new Omicron iant, symptoms have been described as being more similar to a common cold.

Jane, with her two children, says the family has to wear dressing gowns and mittens to stay warm, reports the Manchester Evening News, since Malus Court, where the family resides, had its outside layer removed.The tower block was stripped of its cladding following the Grenfell disaster in  which killed  people. But as the building’s heating system is reliant on the building being insulated, the removal of cladding has left the building - and its residents - open to the freezing elements. Some residents of the Pendleton tower block say their energy prices are now so expensive they cannot afford to have their heating on more than C and rarely have lights on.Mum-of-two Jane, who moved into the property in October , works part-time and is on Universal Credit and says the energy bills regularly exceed her monthly income. As a result, her -month-old son has to spend his days in mittens and a hat, while his three-year-old sister and his mum are forced to wear dressing gowns. Jane said: “I sit at night, scared, wondering where I am going to get the money from. “I have got tin foil behind the radiators to try and keep the heat in. [The kids are] not opening the curtains to keep the heat in. “They have to sleep with hot water bottles. They are always full of cold. Then they are full of damp. “I cannot break into the kids’ money. Thataposs for nappies.”  Another mum in the tower block, Maria, who is unable to work owing to English lessons and caring for her five-year-old son, added: “The jobcentre said I should stay at home without child care because it costs so much, I canapost afford it. “I have a smart meter and I am always checking it. I have a five-year-old son. I have to do things at home. “Itaposs simple ordinary things. My son has to sleep in my bed. I cannot leave him there. This is not a le.”  Last year, she spent £, on energy, with the minimum being a £ monthly payment. At times, Maria was spending close to £ every four weeks. The building’s NIBE heating system uses vents to draw fresh air in which can then be warmed and circulated. Removing the cladding means there is less residual heat than it is designed for, causing freezing conditions for residents of the Salford City Council-owned building. Deputy Mayor John Merry said completion of works to warm the building will be done as fast as humanly possible.  He added: The reason the cladding had to be taken off the blocks was for resident safety. After Grenfell, it has been revealed there has been a national failure of building regulations and we are now legally obliged to remove and replace all cladding made from these materials. “From the perspective of the Council, we are working as hard and fast as we can with the resources we have available. Salford was one of the first Councils in the country to announce the removal and replacement of its cladded blocks – but the Government blocked our attempts to finance the speedy removal and replacement locally, and then also told us that Pendleton Together’s [PTOL] blocks were not eligible for government grant money. “After a y process of acquiring private finance on private finance markets, PTOL have removed the dangerous cladding. But structural issues have slowed work – alongside international supply-chain shortages and national labour shortages.” Pendleton Together added it was sorry to hear any examples of residents facing dficulties. A spokesperson said: Pendleton Together know that some of our residents face dficulties heating their home every winter. “Where this is due to energy prices or financial hardship we provide specialist staff who can advise on the support available and work with them to offer reassurance.“This is a service we have always provided and will continue to provide after the programme of fire safety works is complete.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsChildcareGrenfell Tower fire\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dad-of-two Dr Gary Jenkins, , sustained le-threatening injuries in an incident in Bute Park in the early hours of Tuesday, July  last year.Dr Jenkins, who was described as a loving father, husband and brother in a statement issued by his family following his death, subsequently died of a severe brain injury at the University Hospital of Wales two weeks later. Jason Edwards, , and Lee William Strickland, , both from Cardf, and a -year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons, are on trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, where they have all denied murder charges.The teen has been described as “evil and sadistic” by a witness for her part in the attack, which was thought to have been a homophobic attack on Dr Jenkins, who was reportedly bisexual, Sun Online reports Edwards, of Litchfield Court, Riverside, Strickland, of no fixed abode, and the youth have each admitted charges of manslaughter, robbery of a bag, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Prosecutor Dafydd Enoch, opening the case on Tuesday, said the killing was motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking for violence. He told the jury: “The man at the centre of this case encountered the worst traits of humankind and despite the best efforts of one person he could not find the protection.” Mr Enoch added: “Dr Gary Jenkins was a -year-old consultant psychologist living and working in Cardf. “On July  last year in the early hours of the morning was in Bute Park in Cardf where he was viciously beaten, robbed, tortured and left for dead by these three defendants in the dock.  “It was a beating apparently motivated by greed, homophobia, and a straightforward liking of violence. All three defendants accept that they all were present when Dr Jenkins was attacked.” He said: “The chilling attack was recorded by a nearby CCTV camera and she can be heard shouting “money” at the top of her voice”. She calls Dr Jenkins ious names, Mr Enoch said, as Edwards could be heard saying: “Stamp his head, stamp his head.” Dr Jenkins could be heard in the CCTV footage pleading with the trio over and over until he could no longer speak, Mr Enoch said. Heavy blows could be heard being delivered to Mr Jenkins, before the girls was heard to say “Yeah, I needed that”. Mr Enoch rebuffed the girl’s claims that she only joined in the attack “half-heartedly” because she was scared of the two older men, saying she was “no wilting flower caught up in something that was not of her making.  “The reality is a million miles from that scenario,” he said. “For her to have acted in that way she must be a very troubled young woman. “She was loud and confident and was laughing during the attack. It was torture, pure and simple. “When witness Lewis Williams fought back to stop the attack she said: “I’m a girl” asshe was the victim. “But she is no ordinary -year-old and Mr Williams described her as “f*****g evil and sadistic”. Addressing the jury  prior to selection, Judge Daniel Williams told them about the case. He said: The defendants are charged with the murder of Gary Jenkins who died following an incident which took place on July  last year in Bute Park in the centre of Cardf.  The prosecutionaposs case is defendants were involved in robbing Gary Jenkins of a bag he was carrying and the three subjected him to a very severe assault from which he was eventually to die  days later. “The prosecutionaposs case is they assaulted a witness who tried to step in. This area of Bute Park is, the prosecution say, known for being an area where gay men have sex. The prosecution say the assault of Gary Jenkins was in some measure homophobic. The allegation of murder is denied. Mr Enoch said the teenage girl had met Edwards and Strickland for the first time on July , when the trio went to the park with the plan to rob a gay man. “They knew what went on in the park late at night and the vulnerable nature of the people who frequented that area,” he said. The group happened across Dr Jenkins, who lived alone in Cardf after separating from his we six years earlier. His we is following the evidence through a video link to the court. Dr Jenkins suffered several bleeds to the brain as a result of the attack, as well as a fractured jaw, a broken nose, swelling to the skull and multiple rib fractures. According to the prosecution, none of the defendants showed a “scintilla” of remorse after the doctor died. The case, which is expected to last four weeks and is being heard in front of Judge Daniel Williams, continues.

Despite settled conditions in coming days, Brits should be careful not to get lulled into a  sense of security with snow possible in seven days time despite bright clear skies before that. However, any cold snap is expected to be brief.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express: “We are expecting to see some changes as we head into the final month of the winter.“Cold and snow will encroach from the north during the early part of February, and some of these wintry downpours may reach as far south as central England and the capital.  “The good news for snow-haters is that these blasts may only be brief as the mild weather from the Atlantic pushes across the UK. “A north-south ide will also bring the worst of the weather to Scotland and northern England with southern Britain likely to dodge the worst of the weather.” Britain is currently being straddled by a huge region of high pressure. This is keeping the snow, wind and rain at bay whilst temperatures still plummet despite the clear skies.  The high pressure will hold on through next week until it finally breaks and gives way to winter winds from the north. Models show these Artic blasts sweeping across the home nations, driven by a huge bloc of low pressure near Greenland. Mr Madden added: “This winter has so far been dominated by high pressure resulting in little in the way of cold spells and widespread snow.  “However, February certainly looks like more topsy-turvy with the weather flipping between cold and mild.” The calm, but cold weather will continue for a week apart from the odd wintry shower across Scotland or the north of England. It will see out what remains of January. Netweather forecaster Ian Simpson however said snow was even further off and that January’s high pressure would last into the early days of the next month.  He said: “High pressure is still dominating the weather, and it doesnapost look set to move very far anytime soon ‑ even at  days out, most of the forecast models still have high pressure very close to or on top of the British Isles. “The weekend looks set to be mainly dry and cloudy, with westerly winds bringing plenty of cloud and moisture into our area of high pressure. “Next week will continue with high pressure, and with high pressure mostly centred over the south of Britain, there will be some sunny spells to the east of high ground and over the south of England, but Northern Ireland, western Scotland and north-west England, will generally be cloudy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A cold snap in January has seen frosty starts and near zero temperatures during the day but the mercury is set to briefly rise in the coming days with milder conditions. There is a north-south split, though, with brighter skies for the south and severe gales and heavy rain predicted for Scotland on Wednesday night and heading into Thursday. BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich says people in England can expect a brighter day on Wednesday but in Scotland strong gales are looming.He said: On Wednesday, England and Wales having a better chance of some sunny spells, although to the south east corner it may stay cloudy for a good part of the day.  Strengthening winds across northern areas, rain just getting into Northern Ireland, certainly settling into western and north western Scotland through the afternoon, gusts of wind in excess of mph in exposed north western parts but milder than it has been certainly across England and Wales. Through Wednesday night it will turn very, very windy across the far north, gales, even severe gales near to the northern isles. A band of cloud and increasingly patchy rain will be sinking its way southwards through the night with some fairly windy weather and relatively cloudy weather as well. Temperatures should stay above freezing in most places.”The blustery conditions are set to remain in place during Thursday in Scotland and there will also be rain for parts of England. Temperatures are expected to be around C to C at the end of the week and Mr Rich said that it could be very mild over the weekend.

It means that during this period one in  people in England was infected with Covid. This is the highest figure since the beginning of Imperial College Londonaposs React- study, which has been running since May . It is also more than three times higher than the prevalence in the previous round of the study, which looked at November  to December . Overall, the data suggests the peak of the wave was around January , with cases flattening off by the middle of the month.  The data also indicates that, while prevalence was decreasing among adults in January, it was rising in children. Meanwhile, of the , people who said whether or not they have previously had Covid, two thirdsreported a past infection. Researchers urged caution, however, saying it is unknown when those past infection were and that PCR tests canpositive results for more than  days after diagnosis.  The increase in prevalence corresponds with Omicron becoming the dominant iant in England, the researchers added. Over the study period, prevalence increased in every region compared to the previous report, with the highest figure recorded in the North East at .%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber at .%. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React programme from Imperialaposs School of Public Health, said: There is good news in our data in that infections had been rapidly dropping during January, but they are still extremely high and may have recently stalled at a very high prevalence. Of particular concern is that there is rapidly increasing prevalence among children now they are mixing more following the start of the school term and, compared with December, prevalence in older people aged -plus has increased seven- to -fold, which may lead to increased hospitalisations. Itaposs therefore vital that we continue to monitor the situation closely to understand the impact of the Omicron iant, which now makes up almost all infections in the country.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: Itaposs reassuring to see Covid- infections beginning to slow across the country as we move back to Plan A.Covid- rates are still high so, as we learn to live with the virus, it is vital we continue to be vigilant - wash your hands, let in fresh air, get tested and,you havenapost already, get boosted now.

Image: HNP Picture Desk Hyde News  Pictures LtdByAbigail OLearyNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments A woman has launched a £, legal battle to win the right to get pregnant using her dead fianceaposs sperm.Ellie Home was devastated four months ago when she lost her partner Myles to pneumonia after a y battle with leukemia.However the couple, who had been together for three years, had already started having IVF treatment to try to have a baby.The -year-old partner now wants to continue that treatment so that she can have the child she and Myles had dreamed of. Speaking at her home in Milton Keynes, Bucks., Ellie said: Before Myles started his treatment, he was askedwe wanted some of his semen to be frozen and stored in case he ever wanted to start a family.He said yes, of course. Having children together was something we had always planned and dreamed of. So there are nine vials in storage with the NHS, waiting to be used.I had started the initial consultations with an IVF clinic and the plan was for me to get pregnant as soon as possible. Tragically, Mylesapos health declined rapidly last year after he suffered a series of infections. However, his death in September was still sudden and unexpected according to Ellie, who has taken his last name, despite the pandemic preventing their marriage. Unfortunately, during the build-up to Mylesapos death, neither the doctors nor any hospital officials mentioned his frozen sperm. Ellie explained: As the law stands, he needed to sign a consent form for me to use his sperm after he passed away. Nobody told us this. We had no idea. Had we known, he would most definitely have signed. We had talked so much about the baby we wanted to have. If it was a boy we planned to call him Mylo, after Myles. If itaposs a girl we wanted to call her Nora, after my nan. We talked about how the child would be into Star Wars and geeky things, just like their dad....death was something that was never anticipated. As Myles did not give explicit consent, Ellie has no legal right to use the frozen sperm for IVF treatment, meaning she will have to fight an uphill legal battle that will cost her up to £,. Ellie has the support of Mylesapos family and is able to support herself and the child. Even so, lawyers have given Ellie only a   chance of winning her case and she has already spent all her funds in her fight. Now she has turned to the public and has set up a GoFundMe page in order to try and raise the funds for her court battle. She said: I am now facing a very long and costly court case to win legality over Mylesapos stored semen, something that should rightly be mine. Not only have I lost the love of my le the man who I built a le with, planned to marry and carry his children but I am on the brink of losing the chance to ever even have our children. We all feel it would be a little bit of Myles that we still have. The child would be loved and cherished. I am desperately in need of raising the funds now, at this point. I have so far used all of our savings that Myles had left to me, the money we had aside to build our future with, to use for our children. Thank you to everyone who has been sharing and donating. You will never know how much it means to us. These past few days I have been completely and solely occupied with gathering up every single piece of evidence to show how much me and Myles wanted children, and how we were already involved in the early stages of IVF.

Natasha Palmer, , suffered a brain injury after a drink-driver smashed into the back of her Renault Clio at high speed on the M in . She was left disabled and unable to work due to severe migraines, poor memory and concentration, light sensitivity and anxiety, as well as dizziness that she described to a doctor as making her walk like she was drunk. But after she sued the other driver Sefer Mantas, his insurance company accused her of fundamental dishonesty and exaggerating her problems.Lawyers for Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Ltd put in excess of seven hundred pages of social media posts loaded by the claimant on her Instagram account before the High Court.They claimed the posts, which showed her enjoying holidays skiing and in India, attending music events and completing sporting challenges including a km Bear Grylls obstacle run, proved she had been lying about the effects of the crash.  But Judge Anthony Metzer QC has now awarded her a massive compensation payout after accepting that her Instagram posts did not present a complete picture, as she would tend to put a positive gloss on how she was doing as she wished to obtain more aposlikesapos. Social media tends to paint a glossy picture of the posteraposs le, he commented, handing her £,, in damages. The court heard that Ms Palmer suffered brain damage as well as damage to her neck, chest, back and ribs. it was said she was left with a disjointed memory after the accident while her car, which had been an th birthday gt, was a write-off. Sefer Mantas was later convicted of drink-driving. Lawyers for Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Ltd accepted liability but hotly disputed the extent of the injuries claimed by Ms Palmer, accusing her of fundamental dishonesty in exaggerating her case. Although she claimed damages of over £m for injuries which she said wrecked her career, defence lawyers said her case was worth just £,.  Ms Palmer, a once super-fit athlete and skier, faced claims that she had lied about the impact of the accident on her le and that her Instagram posts proved it. The insureraposs barrister Charles Woodhouse claimed her posts showed Ms Palmer had taken part in much more signicant physical exercise than she admits in her witness statements or to any of the medical experts. He added: Ms Palmeraposs social media posts also show her attending musical and other events with large numbers of people and noise. He further noted that she had also gone travelling to India four months after her crash and taken a skiing holiday in the Rockies in February . The judge said: It is undoubtedly clear that some of the images portrayed on the claimantaposs social media call for an explanation. But he went on: In determining how much reliance to place upon those social media posts...social media tends to paint a glossy picture of the posteraposs le. The claimant repeatedly denied that she had intended to mislead anyone, the court heard. She described her social media posts as a snapshot of what you want people to see, the positive and exciting side of your le, not the day-to-day dficulties, the judge said. It was...important to the claimantaposs identity to be seen by friends or others as doing normal things. The judge found that she was not being dishonest about her sporting activity being severely impacted, despite the images she posted. She had always been competitive, had been a sports captain, had been in competitions and had skied, he said. The sporting activity she undertook afterward and posted about was relaxing in comparison, he went on, pointing out that she took three hours and  minutes to finish the Bear Grylls event at a gentle jog and missed out several obstacles. I found the claimant to be an honest, helpful, impressive and dignied witness in her own case. I consider that the substantial number of symptoms the claimant now has arose from the outset of the accident and were caused or substantially contributed by it. He concluded that Ms Palmer, who formerly worked in media and marketing for the Ministry of Sound nightclub and the Hippodrome Casino, would have progressed in her career to become a chief marketing officer on a £,-a-year salary had it not been for the accident. He handed her £.m for future loss of earnings as part of her £.m payout.

I’ve come in to try size  jeans in dferent shops, she explained. I want to see how they really fit, no matter what dress size you are. You might wonder why one minute everything fits, and two months later you can’t even zip those jeans up.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The first pair of jeans that Maria tried on was from HM - a pair of skinny high waist denim. These are HM, she said. I’m a UK . I’ve had two children and they just don’t fit. I want to show you that on the high street,you’re feeling deflated in a changing room, it’s not you - it’s them. Next up was a pair from Zara, which Maria could barely zip up. But when she tried on a pair of size  jeans from Next, they fit easily - with a lot of room to spare. And the same with her choice from New Look - she was able to button them up with ease. I can now laugh it off, but for so many women, it’s not that easy, she sighed. I hope this video makes you remember - size is just a number. We need to ignore the sizes that are on these labels. Because these companies are not consistent. We need to tell our daughters, our friends, our mums, our sisters - that our value is not based on the size of our clothes. So next time you go shopping and you can’t work out why the jeans don’t fit just remember it’s not you - it’s them. In the caption to the Instagram video, Maria explained that she used to not buy clothes in the size up. I used to feel embarrassed, ashamed, insecure. And now thanks to the power of the internet, I realise this is a massive thing that so many women are noticing and flagging. I hope highlighting this reminds you thatyou can’t fit in those jeans or that dress, please size up and please don’t feel upset doing so. Fans rush to praise her message in the comments, as one person said: Love this! I always come out of Zara feeling a fat frump and want t go home and be nil by mouth, so at least this video shows that the sizes are all dferent. Another wrote: This is the best thing Iaposve seen today. A third commented: I love this! So true, I hate sizing up but Iaposm slowly becoming more comfortable doing so... hopefully, Iaposll get there one day.

Their roommate had also informed them that there was no assigned parking in the neighbourhood, meaning they were perfectly within their rights to do so.Little did they know at the time that their perfectly reasonable choice would lead to them making an unexpected enemy, with one of their neighbours being hellbent on getting the same spot.

But then things got a little more intense.They recalled: The problems started arising when they would leave and then put a chair in the spot, basically prohibiting me from entering the spot. They will also tend to block the spot which further irritates me because they have theI canapost have it no one can have it mentality.The poster is now considering just moving the chair, remarking that itaposs ridiculous to hold a spot that isnapost assigned, however they are concerned that doing so would make them the a**hole in this situation.Many of those commenting have since reassured the writer of the post that they are absolutely not the one being unreasonable here. One person even urged them to move the chair every time you see it, even when you don’t need the spot while another no-nonsense person remarked,I had to move it a second time, it’d be into a dumpster.Thinking along similar lines, a third person suggested: Forget moving it, Iaposd throw it out.

And,that wasnapost bad enough, the womanaposs own husband even agreed with him and told her she should be dressing more appropriately in her own home. Although we just got back from our honeymoon, I still wear lingerie and sometimes walk around in them when I wake up in the morning when making coffee or breakfast, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.The other day I was in the kitchen preparing coffee while my husband was out and heard a knock on the door, I immediately went to grab my long rope before answering.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the woman answered the door, she was greeted by her next door neighbour, who informed her that his seven-year-old daughteraposs room looks onto their living room, and she recently saw her wearing inappropriate clothes when looking out using her binoculars. I was taken back. turns out his daughter uses her binoculars to supposedly watch the yard but she obviously peeped through our large glass windows to see inside even though we have curtains on, she continued. My neighbour said this wasnapost cool and his daughter just saw apossomething she cannotapos un-see, that is not appropriate. I asked him what he meant and he requested that I be a little considerate when it comes to clothingbut I thought that was just ridiculous since that is my house. The woman argued back, telling him that she has a right to wear whatever she wants in her own home and that his little girl has no business peeping. He told her that sheaposs just a curious little girl and meant no harm, prompting her to tell him to leave. He didnapost take it well and implied that heaposd take steps to ensure I donapost aposexposeapos his daughter to stuff like that in the future. He left and I just thought my entire day was ruined especially after he said heaposd bring this incident to the neighbourhoodaposs groupaposs attention, she continued. I told my husband what happened when he got home and he agreed with our neighbour saying that I should aposjust leave the lingerie in the bedroomapos where it belongs and learn to put some decent clothes on to avoid this type of incident. He also said I was wrong to speak to our neighbour like that and thathe was in his shoes and his kid witnessed aposthatapos heaposd be just as furiousnot more, so we should cut our neighbour some slack. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was in the wrong or whether her neighbour had crossed a line. Both men are blaming you for being comfy behind closed doors while the neighbours child peeps through windows with binoculars. He should teach his child to mind their damn business, one Reddit user wrote. My petty a** would withhold any intimacy or body contact from the husband because the neighbours might see and blame you for being to inappropriate for his daughter to watch through binoculars from their house. Another added: Your neighbour is and the fact your husband agreed with them is problematic as well. He should buy you more lingerie as an apology.

But now, some schools have even gone as far as banning certain sugary items, in a bid to curb the national issue.While the issue of what your kids should be eating at school continues to be debated, one nursery teacher has revealed that what you put in your childrenaposs packed lunches could actually say more about your parenting than you think. Sharon Birch, owner and founder of the Footprints Learning for Le nursery in Hartlepool, says that she and her colleagues pass no judgement on parents, but try to gently encourage them to provide healthy and nutritious meals for their kids, by giving out helpful guides on what could be included. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.It doesn’t have to be a work of art, haute cuisine, or done to impress, it just has to be healthy and filling, she told The Sun.Sharon says the most common item found in childrenaposs lunch boxes is sandwiches, which is a tradition dating back many years, but the popular fillings have changed over the years. Sometimes, kids come to nursery with shop bought sandwiches in their packs, which Sharon says is usually representative of parents who work long hours or even those who work in supermarkets. Chocolate and crisps are generally frowned upon, and Sharon says they do try and encourage parents to come up with healthier alternatives, but admits they are very common staples for a lot of families. Meanwhile, fruit is always encouraged, but she says they do tend to step in to help with items such as grapes to ensure theyaposre cut and arenapost at risk of being a choking hazard. We understand that some parents financially struggle, and often unhealthy choices are cheaper in the supermarkets, which makes for tough choices, Sharon continued. One young girl would regularly bring in a huge naan bread, a few bars of chocolate and little . Mum told us that was all she’d eat but we offered some healthier snacks and she loved them. She went on to say that some parents will pack more mature foods, such as pitta bread and hummus and pistachios for their kids, but revealed these will only get tossed aside to share a friendaposs naughty crisps. Some parents have time to create beautul masterpiece lunches for their kids, whereas others will throw together whatever they can in the spare time they have, and both of those things are fine - thereaposs no parent shaming here.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The ex-staffers have spoken of the airline authorities acting as the “weight police” and keeping tabs on employees’ weight.

Staff were also only allowed red, clear or neutral nail polish and had to have neat hair at all times, according to the crew member. While this might seem strict to people working in other industries, it is quite standard for cabin crew.

The object looks like a classic disk with a pointed hump at its centre. One photo even shows a huge circle around it...similar to that of a crop circle, but then disappears in the next photo months later.

Experts warned he was a heart attack waiting to happen due to severe obesity being connected to a fourfold increase in cardiac failure.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Moscow’s elite forces have advanced across the border ahead of the main force of combat troops.The Mirror has learned Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit and Spetsnaz crack troops are believed already to be in Ukraine preparing for war. They are seen as an advance party appearing to plot an attack by , regular forces gathered at Ukraine’s eastern flank as well as thousands more in Belarus. It came as British special forces are preparing for a mass evacuation of more than , British nationalsthey become stranded.  They are being told to register with the skeleton embassy left in Kyiv, from where they will be air-evacuated or bussed by road  miles east to Poland.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned British troops could soon be sent to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO against Russia.Mr Wallace told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee there were iniduals already in Ukraine “linked to the Russian state in ways that are not conventional” and “that should give cause for concern”. He added: “We are becoming aware of a signicant number of iniduals that are assessed to be associated with Russian military advance force operations that currently are located in Ukraine. “And that is what we expect to see next and what we’re seeing now.”  Ukraine’s SBU intelligence and security agency is working round the clock to seize Russian spooks trying to pinpoint the country’s defences. Several have been arrested in the contested Donbas area in recent months and Ukraine forces have massively locked down security. Russian covert operatives in Ukraine will be preparing espionage, sabotage operations and anything to undermine Ukraine’s defences. Britain has given thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles to Kyiv’s forces to help them hold back a Russian armoured attack, along with  UK military trainers.  Mr Wallace added: “Any crossing into Ukraine, whether small or large, would be viewed as a breach of that sovereignty, against international law and an invasion. “You can’t be half-pregnant, you are either invading a country or you are not.” On Tuesday Mr Johnson warned the UK may deploy troops to protect Nato allies in Europe should Russia invade, saying Vladimir Putin faces “ferocious” Ukrainian resistance. The PM said the UK and its allies stand ready to impose “heavy economic sanctions” on Russia, amid fears of “bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya or Bosnia”.  Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: “If Russia pursues this path, many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home. “The response in the international community would be the same and the pain that would be inflicted on the Russian economy will be the same.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party “stands resolute” in supporting Ukraine.Mr Johnson added: “The British Army leads the Nato battle group in Estonia andRussia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.”  He went on: “There is nothing new about large and powerful nations using the threat of brute force to terry reasonable people into giving way to otherwise completely unacceptable demands. “ButPresident Putin was to choose the path of bloodshed and destruction, he must realise that it’d be both tragic and futile, and nor should we allow him to believe that he could easily take some smaller portion of Ukraine - to salami-slice - because the resistance would be ferocious.” The SAS-led UK evacuation mission is already in Ukraine preparing for an emergency evacuation, along with the Special Forces Support Group. Foreign Office advice was posted stating: ”British nationals in Ukraine are requested to register their presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information but it is still advised that British nationals continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.” The request for UK nationals to register their details is a ’standard operating procedure’ by the FCDO when they planning an evacuation such as in the Lebanon, Sierra Leone and more recently Kabul. A senior source said: “It could be a simple operationwe can get people to the airport and fly out, butMoscow imposes an air embargo it will be a nightmare. “We know the Germans and other countries are also planning to airlt their people and we are looking at using a road route to the Polish border, but will be the FCDO’s call.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Foreign OfficeNatoBritish ArmyBoris JohnsonBen WallaceVladimir PutinArmed forcesSpecial forcesPoliticsDaily MirrorUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed

marine environment is crucialwe want them to help protect it. It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

At that time, the local authority said the land was allocated for “circa  homes”.However, Persimmon Homes has gone beyond that figure and is looking to create a residential development of “circa  units”.Twenty-five per cent of the properties, which would include terraced, semi-detached and detached homes, would be classed as affordable.Access to the new homes would come from two new junctions created on Lammermoor Terrace, while a SUDSwould be created in the east of the site.Various studies will make up part of any application to the council.If the scheme is eventually approved, the developer will have to agree a sum for contributions to a range of projects, including extending both Windygoul Primary School and Ross High School.A sum would also be agreed “towards the enhancement of community sports facilities at Polson Park”.Money would also go towards covering the impact on a number of junctions, including Bankton Junction onto the A.Representatives from Persimmon Homes East Scotland were available to answer any questions about the scheme last Thursday afternoon.A spokesperson for the company revealed that nearly  people attended the online event.They said: “We hope local residents found it helpful:  attended and  questions were asked.“The most frequently raised concerns were general disruption during construction and extra local traffic on Birsley Road and Lammermoor Terrace.“Anyone who was unable to join the consultation can find out more about the proposed development by going to persimmonhomes lammermoor-terrace and sites.google view lam mermoor-terrace“Those wishing to comment can still do so by submitting an email or via post before January .“We will be reviewing all comments and how they can be addressed within the next stage of our planning application to East Lothian Council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-railway-station-office-opening-hours-slashed","story":"Opening hours of the office at the station, which links the county with the north of England as well as Edinburgh, could be reduced by nearly  hours per week.The idea is being weighed up by ScotRail, which operates more than , train services through  stations throughout Scotland.Fewer than  stations have staffed ticket offices, with Dunbar making up part of that number.The move has been criticised by rail union RMT and the county’s MP Kenny MacAskill and MSP Paul McLennan.RMT is “wholly opposed” to cuts to ticket offices and believes that these will deter passengers from the rail network and make it less accessible for disabled and elderly passengers.They claim that cuts to ticket office hours worsen passenger service, safety and security by reducing the times that staff are guaranteed to be present at stations and make it far easier for operators to reduce overall staffing levels in the future.Mick Lynch, general secretary, said: “Cuts to ticket office hours will do nothing to restore passenger confidence in Scotland’s sustainable rail network, which has a central role to play in delivering modal sht away from high-carbon transport.“These proposals affect nearly all of the ticket offices in Scotland and will undoubtedly worsen passenger service and accessibility, as well as turning many of our stations into a mugger’s paradise.”Mr MacAskill backed the RMT in opposing the reduction in hours.Currently, the booking office – the only one of its kind in East Lothian – is open from .am to .pm from Monday to Friday.The proposed changes would see the office open at .am and shut at .pm with the exception of Friday, when it would close  minutes earlier.Changes would also be introduced on a Saturday and Sunday.The booking office opens at .am on a Saturday and shuts at .pm, with opening hours of .am to .pm on a Sunday.

In fact, the benefits of plants and green spaces are now so well documented that medical professionals are beginning to see gardening as an important means of helping improve the wellbeing of some patients.Although not everyone is fortunate enough to have a garden, most will have space for an indoor plant and the value of those shouldn’t be overlooked. They remove the invisible air-borne pollutants that exist in all homes coming from everyday household cleaning products, decorating materials, upholstery and furniture.This, together with a plant’s natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, means that they are continuously improving the quality of the air that we breathe.In addition to these direct physical and mental benefits, home-grown vegetables are undoubtedly one of the best ways to source fresh, healthy food and reduce food miles. Just imagine the satisfaction of growing your own herbs and veg, and collecting on the very day you plan to use them in your meal – it just doesn’t get any fresher than that!If you’d like to try growing your own fresh, healthy meals, here’s a few ideas about how you might start:l Potatoes should be grown from certied seed potatoes which have been tested, are disease-free and true to iety. Seed potatoes are available now in reputable garden centres and you can start them off indoors, encouraging them to sproutso they have a start when you plant them out. Potatoes will generally be planted out in March April, with First Earlies harvesting as early as June July. Second Earlies can be harvested in August September, while Maincrop potatoes can be harvested into October. The early potatoes are those wonderfully tasty ‘new potatoes’ but don’t store as well as the maincrop ieties are able to be harvested and kept for use throughout the winter.l Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, caullower, sprouts and broccoli can be grown from seed starting in the next few weeks or purchased as seedlings in the garden centre in springtime when it’s time to plant them out.l Root vegetables such as carrots or parsnips can be dficult to transplant and prefer to be grown from seed sown directly into the place where they’ll grow.l Salad vegetables are mostly very easy to grow from seed and can be started indoors in the next few weeks until it’s warm enough to let them grow outdoors. It’s also an economical way to feed the family – for the price of a lettuce in the supermarket, you could buy a pack of seeds that could grow several hundred lettuce! Many salad vegetables only take a few weeks from sowing to harvesting, so we suggest that you sow a few little and often and you’ll have a continuous crop for many months of the year. Extend the season by starting or finishing the crop indoors when the weather is too cold for growing outdoor.l Microgreens, miniature vegetables that make an attractive and tasty garnish, take only days to grow from seed and are an easy kitchen window-sill crop. As with the salad vegetables, sow little and often to have a continuous crop.Hopefully this gives you some suggestions to help you with your plans for a healthier lestyle and even helps your budget!If you need more help and advice, our plant team are always delighted to help and you will find lots more information on the seed packets and online at merryhattonHappy gardening for !"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gastropub-named-best-uk","story":"The Bonnie Badger in Gullane, East Lothian placed in the - category, being awarded position number .The Estrella Damm Top  Gastropub Awards is created each year by an academy of several hundred judges spread throughout the UK who vote for who they think are the must-see gastropubs.The academy is made up of food industry experts, chefs, operators, food writers and journalists, all of whom keep a close eye on the market and the trends within.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion.

One was brought by the Celts from the Iberian peninsula, the other by people from Ukraine.These two populations of Scots pines remain, thousands of years on, genetically distinct, and also separate in distribution.The pines brought here from the Iberian peninsula cover the landscape to the west of Loch Ness, those from the Ukraine occupy the east of that line.One of the reasons Rawlence finds them so interesting, he says, is because they are part of a much wider story, which he tells, of how humans and trees have long been interlinked.“What I hope people take away, overall, is that the way that the boreal has evolved in lots of dferent places is contingent upon humans. It has always been. We have always been entangled with its destiny. We have co-evolved together. And that’s just as true for the larch as it is for the spruce as it is for the Scots pine or the birch. The reindeer grazing create the conditions for the birch. It’s all interlinked.”He tells the story of six key species which form the treeline, Scots pine, birch, larch, spruce, poplar and rowan, and how climate change is impacting not just their distribution but the lives of the people who have lived for millennia alongside them.But it’s the Scots pine I most want to talk with him about. I’ve long been a lover myself of the tree – the way its branches stretch their needles this way and that seeking out the sun, throwing expressive shapes. I can remember the realisation that this tree that cloaked the edge of Scottish lochs, was the same that filled the air with pine scent between holiday campsite and beach in France.That was an early glimmering that this tree we call Scots may not be ours, later confirmed when a Swedish friend Jannica Honey talked to me for my book, For The Love Of Trees, about a pine she called simply the Tall, which, when she found it here, would remind her of home. The tree we call Scots has many homes, and many peoples have a relationship with it.You only have to go back around  years to find a history in which Scots pine is arriving as an invasive species, brought here from the Iberian peninsula and Ukraine. The name tells us little about where it really came from, and more about the colonising role that Britain had in global history.As Rawlence puts it, “All of this stuff is tangled up with everything  – the dominance of Britain and colonialism how we see and name things.”Research into genetics and archaeology has uncovered these stories of the tree’s past.: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees“The provenance,” says Rawlence, “of the western group of Scots pine is quite well established. They were brought from Iberia by Celts moving up the river estuaries. There’s quite a strong archaeological record of the pines moving up the west coast of Britain and then spreading into Caledonia on time scales which were much faster than they would have been had they been regenerating naturally. The only plausible explanation is that they were brought by humans.”The Celts from Iberia were, he says, effectively travelling “with their own habitat, the pine”, the tree that provided them with food and other resources, with flour even, which could be made from its bark. Meanwhile, people from Ukraine, where a refugium of Scots pines had lingered since the previous Ice Age were also taking their special tree with them. Recent research has shown that the eastern population of Scottish pines is genetically very similar to those pines. Again, it was people who brought the tree, as they migrated across to the Sami territories of Norway and then over the North Sea to Scotland.The tree and the people have both left their mark on the Scotland of today and its gene pools. The red hair of the Ukrainian migrants, and the black of the Celts, exist alongside the trees that they brought with them. Rawlence says that we even find traces of this migration in folklore and oral history. When he mentioned his reearch to ethnobotanist Diana Beresford- Kroeger, she immediately connected it to Celtic stories which tell of how Iberians met the Ukrainians somewhere near John O’Groats coming the other way. “There is a popular word for people of the Danube who had red hair that comes from this encounter. Those two pieces of historical evidence together with the oral history, are a lovely discovery,” he says.When we think about restoring the lost forests of Scotland, often it’s the native pine forest we imagine. But, had these people not brought the pine with them, we might be looking at a very dferent Scotland, with uplands covered with oak woodland. How does that knowledge, affect what kind of forest we might want to regenerate now Rawlence is keen that we don’t write humans, who, as he says, have co-evolved with trees, out of both nature’s history and its future. “I applaud the rewilding efforts, the efforts to recover nature,” he says. “But it’s worth remembering that humans were always there. And the sustainability of those efforts and those landscapes is going to be contingent upon some kind of human interaction – whether that’s farming, new kinds of wildle tourism, a hunting economy. We have to have a relationship and an entanglement with it. And hopefully these efforts should also be tied to social justice and access for everybody.”He touches on an important debate, in these times of increasing rewilding. We might ask ourselves what the aims of rewilding really are  What are we trying to restore, and in a time when, due to climate change, the conditions are set to change anyway “This is the central tension that I was trying to get to in the chapter on Scotland,” Rawlence says. “Both sides of the rewilding debate are looking back. You’ve got the existing conservation economy saying it was never like that. You’ve got the rewilding utopianism of a kind of pristine boreal forest, which we know by  years ago was already gone in the British Isles. Both of their claims, those dferent claims to the past, are incomplete.”It was his attempt to follow the boreal treeline – the northern line that winds across altitude and latitude and is the limits of where trees will grow – that brought Rawlence to the north of Scotland and the story of the Scots pine. Rawlence, who is not an ecologist, but a former Human Rights Watch researcher and political speechwriter, who has, in Wales, set up an education institution to teach “creative and adaptive thinking” called Black Mountains College. He started to look at this treeline zone when he was on the hunt for a good new subject following his book on Somali refugees, City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp.“The Horn of Africa,” he says, “is a very sensitive area, just like the Arctic. Historically it has had a very stable, very narrow temperature range, with monsoons and very delicate climate patterns which are finely calibrated, which were being disrupted.” What he noticed was that all the “displacement issues, the conflict and the human rights issues” he was covering were connected to and driven by this “underlying change”.“I thought, well, the next thing I want to do is not just go somewhere cold but look at another place where climate change is visible. If we’re going to talk about climate change and we’re going to interrogate what it means, why don’t we go and look at the places where it’s been happening for a long time.”He went in search of a storyline, a way of communicating the enormous topic of climate, something that would enable him to talk about the way we need to “start thinking about our relationship with the non-human world, with other species.”In the treeline he found a story which touched on the lives of indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, but in which trees were the chief protagonist. For the treeline, he observes, has been on the march. “They’ve been moving since World War One,” he notes.It’s a movement that in many other parts of the world is visible, and noticeable to those who live there. But not here, in Scotland, where, Rawlence says, “you’re not seeing the march because you don’t have the trees. They are gone. There’s only a tiny fraction left. Here in Britain we have been highly successful at annihilating our forest. We’ve got  percent tree cover which is the lowest number in Europe. We have annihilated our ancient woodlands, perhaps more than any other country on earth. Research has shown we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.”Rawlence believes that it’s no coincidence that Britain which “was the driver of the industrial revolution, a pioneer of capitalism, and property rights and enclosure and clearances” has suffered such extraordinary nature depletion. One of the books he cites as having had a profound influence on him, when he read it  years ago, was John Prebble’s The Highland Clearances.“We’ve absolutely written the text book on how to drive nature to the brink in the service of profit. Wales and Scotland and Ireland, are all particularly interesting examples of that. Because the patterns of colonialism and exploitation are written in the landscape.”One of his first chapters revolves around his search for the treeline in Scotland. What’s notable about it is that it seems like the pursuit of some elusive phantom. We have over centuries so stripped our landscape of trees that we no longer know where they might grow, what their limits might be, but nevertheless, Rawlence went hunting for the Cairngorms’ very highest trees.What he was directed to by ecologists, was, he says, not exactly the treeline, but just the place that was the closest approximation to it. “They’ve got a competition going now to see who can geolocate the highest trees in the Cairngorms, amongst the Cairngorms Connect.”In theory, Rawlence says, “Scotland is on the boreal treeline”. We were formerly a “boreal nation” like some of our neighbours. “All of the species in Scotland are continuous with Norway and Russia and it’s exactly the same historical process and exactly the same band of climate niche for those boreal species. But nobody knows where the treeline is because the trees are gone. You don’t see the march.”This means that there’s a sign here that we are not seeing. “When you lose an intact ecosystem, you lose your early warning system. You lose your map of the territory. You lose your guide.”A combination of factors mean that we are not seeing the change. One is that many species are long gone, the other is that, Rawlence describes, we don’t have indigenous communities living so closely with nature as there are in other countries. “They notice for example in Russia that there’s a new grass on the block in the Taiga. They notice that there’s a new butterfly that nobody knows the name for. Whereas in Scotland the most sensitive species to climate change are probably already gone  years ago,  years ago. That’s why we don’t see it. It’s because it’s already gone and we don’t know what we’re looking for and we’ve lost.”Often it’s said that our landscapes are missing key species, the lynx, the wolf, the bear, the beaver, many of these so long gone that it’s hard to imagine the country with them. But it’s also, as Rawlence observes, we are missing humans living closely with the landscape.There are other losses too. We don’t have the kind of indigenous knowledge that Rawlence found in some of the other communities he visited along the treeline. “Our indigenous knowledge is very very lost,” he says. “There are little echoes and tremors and traces of it. But it’s been systematically destroyed through superstition and Christian hegemony for a thousand years. You find it in crackpots and the weirdo books in the funny bookshops. It’s also in the language. It’s in Welsh. It’s in Gaelic.”As we face the prospect of a climate crisis, we might want to dig deeper into the past. Knowing the factors that made that past unfold as it did, he says, is vital. “If you understand better the contingency of the past, then the future becomes mutable. It becomes possible. It becomes something you can change, rather than this horrible place of powerlessness and denial where the only response to climate change is to run away or to bury your head in the sand, or be cynical.”Meanwhile, the treeline remains elusive in Scotland. Is it here, or is it not  Might we, through regeneration, find where it should be  “What’s exciting about Scotland is thatyou take the overgrazing out of the picture then you’ll see what’s going to happen and where the treeline is. It might be already above the top of the mountains.” A key aim of Cairngorms Connect is to allow trees to re-establish up to the natural treeline.Perhaps, he even suggests the whole of the Cairngorms were once entirely covered with forest. Cairn gorm is Gaelic for ‘blue mountains’, and he theorises perhaps this is because of the blue-green of the pines.One of the messages of The Treeline is that we are going to have to soon face a future where the climate is dferent. For Rawlence is fairly sure that we are on that trajectory towards  degrees, not the . degrees that was the fragile goal of COP.“- percent of scientists agree that . degrees is impossible,” he says. “When I started this research  years ago, it might have been argued that . degrees was in reach, but there’s now the reality of physics to contend with. And the other reality which has been a feature in my le is the reality of politics and I just know that the system is not going to sht that fast. So evenphysically it was possible, politically I know the hard limits of where we are and I despair of the ability to sht.”Rawlence’s despair at politics partly comes from his experience of working within it. In the run up to the Iraq war, he was a speechwriter for Charles Kennedy and lead for the Liberal Democrats for the campaign against that war.: Rewild Scotland: \"Beavers in all rivers. Lynx and wolf back.”“I used to wake up,” he recalls, “with nightmares about Tony Blair, frustrated with the fact we could win the argument and popular opinion, and yet with oil and the US and [President] Bush it’s happening and there’s nothing you can do. I had a very visceral experience of the unresponsiveness of the democratic system. I saw how fossil capital was hardwired into the system. Not just fossil capital but capital more broadly, and that you cannot extricate capital from its principal energy source. Without fossil fuels it doesn’t work.”He places little hope in the processes of international summits like COP. He calls the over-focussing on emissions “carbon reductionism” and dismisses net zero as a “dangerous delusion”.“I think hopefully what the book shows you is that nature is really complicated, that carbon is a system that’s in flux all the time, with enormous volatility. If you want to use the econometric metaphor like net zero, then you have to acknowledge that this is  accounting.”Nature, he says, is “supremely complicated”. It’s those communities he features in the books who live closely with it that understand it best.Rawlence has uncovered a fascinating story about the history of the Scots pine in Scotland, but what about its future  There, what he has found is not nearly so lovely. Startlingly, he notes that climate change may mean that it disappears from our landscape. This is a prediction he came across in ious scientic papers, which to him felt “earthshattering”, but which he noted was not “front page news”, nor had it even really been explored by journalists.He first noticed mention of the possibility in an RSPB handbook to Abernethy forest and that referenced models from the Met Office and University of Oregon which talked about climate velocity and the survivability of Scots pines at ious latitudes. “It didn’t take much,” he says, “to join the dots and say thatthey were gone at  degrees north and we’re at , that means that they’re gone.”“It sounds shocking and it might not arrive on the timescales that the models predict, but at some point in the next centurythe warming trajectory continues as at present and we get to C in the next decade and C by , then yes it does mean that there won’t be any more Scots pines in Scotland.“That’s a terrible thought. But hopefully that will give people pause and they will start to engage more with not just rewilding, but nature recovery and strategic ecology and thinking more broadly about our landscape and how we relate to it and what we need from it.”The Treeline: The Last Forest and the Future of Le on Earth by Ben Rawlence is published by Jonathan Cape"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Critical to this is the creation of a fabrication supply chain.As a first step, the STUC asks the First Minister to convene a major summit of successful bidders to begin the process of planning for a supply chain revolution in Scotland.Scotland gains from the Crown Estates Scotland auction of the seabed plots around the Scottish coast, netting a one-off £m. Its profits are given to the Scottish Treasury or split between some local authorities.Based on proposed project rents outlined by seabed managers Crown Estates Scotland, it was revealed that the ScotWind projects operating at its full capacity would be estimated to bring Scotland between £m and £m each year - a tiny fraction of the billions expected in profits.While the total impact on the associated supply chain and on the number of jobs created will not be known until later in the process, the First Minister said their estimates suggest as much as £ billion could be generated for every gigawatt of power. A gigawatt equates to roughly two coal-fired power plants and is enough to power , homes in Britain.Some believe the Scottish supply chain spin off is an “overpromise” with current bids currently excluding any firm commitments.Scottish energy secretary Michael Matheson last week failed to answer whether there would be any specic, binding commitments for winning bidders to deliver investment and jobs in Scotland, after being urged to make sure the benefits are not “squandered”.STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: “Rarely has the phrase, ‘we wouldn’t have started from here,’ been more relevant than it is for the ScotWind leasing round. We should not be reliant on overseas private companies to deliver the jobs we need. More profits should be coming to Scotland to be invested in our future.“However, it is not too late for government to intervene through ownership, investment and conditionality.“We heard plenty of encouraging noises from corporations in the run up to the ScotWind announcement, now we begin the process of turning those promises into reality.”The Common Weal think tank says that a lack of manufacturing capacity in Scotland means that supply chain promises may not be forthcomingcompanies believe it is cheaper to import material rather than invest in Scotland.Last year the Herald on Sunday revealed that Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Governments economic development agency faced the loss of up to £.m of taxpayers money through the collapse of offshore wind tower firm CS Wind, the only UK facility for manufacturing onshore and offshore wind towers and seen as a key part of Scotlands green revolution.Common Weal has long advocated the establishment of a state-owned company which would have owned energy resources, to provide secure, reliable and low-cost retail energy to households and to ensure there were renewable energy supply chain and manufacturing jobs for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon said in  that the Scottish Government planned to set up a state-owned energy company in Scotland which was due to be established last year but was dropped in September."},{"url":null,"title":"lily-douglas-st-johnstone-hold-14th-minute-applause-late-fan","story":"Young St Johnstone fan Lily Douglas sadly passed away on Sunday after a long battle with Ewing Sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects bones or the tissue around bones.The -year-old had been fighting the disease since being diagnosed in , and her mother announced the tragic news on her social media pages on Sunday Evening.Lily had a passion for dancing and had previously performed at a half-time show with her dance troop at McDiarmid Park and loved going to the games.The Perth club announced they would be paying their respects to her in tomorrow evenings home match against Dundee, by asking fans to join in with a minutes applause in the th minute.Young Lily Douglas tragically passed away recently and as such we would like to pay tribute to her.Can every fan attending tomorrow join us in a minute’s applause to honour her le on the th minuteR.I.P Lily Douglas 💙A statement on the clubs website said: \"Lily Douglas was a brave young woman you tragically passed away recently.Everyone at the club would like to pass on their condolences to Lilys family.

They’ll always be his supporters and he’ll spin it in a way that helps him but at the end of the day he’s an absolute knob.”Kyrgios and Kokkinakis will move to Rod Laver Arena on Thursday for their semi-final against Spaniard Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina.Should they win that, they could well find themselves in a final against Britain’s Joe Salisbury and American Rajeev Ram.The second seeds are bidding to reach the final for a third successive year having won it in  and been runners-up  months ago, and they eased past Italian duo Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini - - in the quarter-finals on Wednesday.Salisbury said of Kyrgios and Kokkinakis: “I think it is good for the doubles draw that those guys are in it and it gets a bit more attention. A lot of people have been enjoying it.“I think we are quite happy going along not worrying about that too much. If we hopefully get through and get to play them in the final, it will be a great situation to be in.“Some of it is borderline. I think it is great to have a lot of support and the crowd really getting into it and getting a bit rowdy but you do want them to be respectful of the players as well. Sometimes it’s a bit over the line.” vw,vw,px, px\"Nick Kyrgios has excited the crowds in Melbourne Salisbury and Ram will get a taste of it on Thursday when they meet another Australian duo, Matt Ebden and Max Purcell, who defeated Britain’s Neal Skupski and Dutchman Wesley Koolhof - - - .Skupski had been unbeaten in  having won two titles with new partner Koolhof, and he said: “You don’t really get to play in front of crowds like that for doubles that often.“I spoke to Max Purcell and he said it’s a lot worse playing against Nick and Thanasi. I think it’s good for doubles. It puts a lot more eyes watching doubles. As long as they behave themselves, it should be OK.“So far I think the energy that Nick’s bringing and Kokkinakis is great for doubles. There’s some stuff that you don’t want to be happening on the court and from the crowd but, as long as they keep it PG, it’s only good really.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Covid passports will no longer be legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas but will still be needed to gain access to a club or to indoor unseated or partially seated events with  people or more.On Tuesday the Department of Health recorded , positive cases of Covid and five deaths in the past  hours.Joe said he hoped that an Executive meeting on February  would remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings to bring nightclubs and other entertainment venues into line with the rest of hospitality.And he said nightclubs had suffered more than any other hospitality setting throughout the pandemic. “It’s coming up to two years since restrictions were introduced and as of today, we’ve been closed for  weeks and open for eight,” he said.“It’s not commonly understood just how catastrophic restrictions have been for us. There have been so many dferent permutations of reopening, that people are confused by it all.“If, for example, you attended a seated concert or a comedy or magic show and wanted to stand up or dance, that hasn’t been possible for  weeks.“Without clarity, we’ve lost access to touring events. A band or DJ touring England and thinking about adding a show in Ireland is faced with a tough decisionnot sure what the rules are orthey might change at any minute.“Anyone who plays to a standing or partially standing audience might then prioritise where, so that’s been very dficult.” Joe said that while it was harder to arrange gigs hastily following last-minute lting of restrictions, the demand for nightclubs was still evidently there, particularly among students. Club nights at The Limelight are selling out fast from Wednesday through to the weekend and staff are gearing up for a busy period ahead. But he’s in no doubt about the upcoming challenges for the sector.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” he said.“But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel.”At the Kremlin nightclub, a deep clean of the premises was under way ahead of reopening and staff were brought in to ensure the sound and light systems were ready for Wednesday night.Allen Gordon said the last reopening had been ‘phenomenal’ and that he was expecting an even better turnout this time around.And he said he was hopeful for the future of the nightclub.“There has been a fantastic reaction on social media to the reopening of the club and we’re expecting a big crowd down come the weekend,” he said.“The response was phenomenal the last time we reopened and we’re expecting an even better reaction this time.“It’s been a dficult time with all the closures and reopenings but it looks like we’re coming out of it now and I don’t think this will happen again, all these restrictions being put in place.“Here’s hoping we’re at the tail end of it, plus we’re coming into the better weather. People want out.“The reopening of nightclubs is a much-needed boost for hospitality.”Most ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinTop VideosPlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayPublic very sick of being taken for fools over MP sleaze, says Ian HislopLatest CoronavirusNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Coronavirus travel rules: Changes for arrivals from non-red list countries‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisSenior civil servant Sue Gray probing Tories ‘faced down IRA hijack bid’LatestMan dies in Co Meath road crashDeath toll rises after blaze at major Kuwait oil refineryEngland are ‘pumped’ ahead of only Test in Ashes series – Heather KnightTwo arrested in Manchester over Texas synagogue stand-offChildren and young teenagers keep Covid infection levels high,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A further  people attending a similar demonstration at Custom House Square in Belfast were also fined.However, no fines were issued at a right-wing ‘Protect our Statues’ protest outside Belfast City Hall a week later.All the fines were eventually refunded in August, with Chief Constable Simon Byrne apologising after the PSNI watchdog found the handling of the protests had been unfair and discriminatory.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up According to a report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson, this treatment was “not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity”.However, confidence in policing in minority communities was damaged as a result.In an effort to help build bridges in the aftermath of the BLM protests, the PSNI awarded an organisation called MutualGain £, to facilitate three preliminary developmental sessions in January . The organisation later ed £, after it was unable to complete the work because of staff sickness.The group describes its mission as empowering organisations and communities to connect in the space “which lies between the state and the inidual”.The PSNI said it approached MutualGain to run the sessions because it was an established service provider with a recognised specialism in the area of confidence in policing.It added the work would help create a process to rebuild trust and formulate an action plan.Mr Arutura sent the PSNI a Freedom of Informationrequest regarding MutualGain’s work but was told there was no “contract of service” with the organisation.After Mr Arutura requested an internal review of the FoI, he was informed there was an agreement between the PSNI and MutualGain to deliver three sessions.“My interest was how we were going to solve the problems that were highlighted by the Policing Board and Police Ombudsman reports, and the recommendations,” he said.“I wanted to find out what was being done to solve those problems andthere was anything new from my  years of working with the police.“I had this uncomfortable feeling that they were doing the same old things again.“So, I wrote the FoI to establish what MutualGain was supposed to establish.“What were they going to provide the PSNI at the end of the consultation and how were they selected  What was the procurement procedure ”MutualGain director Susan Ritchie said the work included carrying out interviews to “inform the co-design of the workshop” and ensure participants were able to share in the way they wanted to.The PSNI said the money ed by MutualGain had been reassigned to the costs associated with the delivery of ongoing engagement facilitated by the force and “not via a third party”, with a view to designing an action plan to “rebuild the lost trust and confidence”.Mr Arutura said Africa House, which represents Africans living in Northern Ireland, had a £, grant application turned down by the PSNI in June. It had planned to use the money to address the issues highlighted at the BLM rallies.Mr Arutura said the framework of how to heal the isions must be “transformative, not prescriptive”, and must include the African community.“The PSNI, the Northern Ireland Office and Stormont must invest a budget,” he added.“There is no money at all. This is the strangest thing. There has been no money set aside to deal with BLM. That’s scary. How can you solve the problemthere are no resources “They need to stop this idea of prescribing solutions to us. We’re not kids.”The PSNI said Africa House’s request for funding was declined because all grant funding for the final year   had been committed at that time.“Secondly, MutualGain’s programme was still progressing with the preparation for the second group focus discussion and had produced one report of its initial findings of the issues, as presented by the attendees from the first focus group,” a spokesperson added.“This report has been shared with all participants. “Mr Arutura was assured at this first meeting that should spending easements arise in the remaining months of that financial year, this application would be reconsidered.”Most ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinTop VideosPlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayPublic very sick of being taken for fools over MP sleaze, says Ian HislopLatest Northern IrelandNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today Family urges revamp of  sat-nav system to aid response timesDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchSuzanne BreenOpinionDoug Beattie gets vital second chance … now he must prove party made right callHands up: Fteen NI venues back open this week for party-goersLatestEngland are ‘pumped’ ahead of only Test in Ashes series – Heather KnightTwo arrested in Manchester over Texas synagogue stand-offChildren and young teenagers keep Covid infection levels highIndia holds scaled-back Republic Day celebrations amid Covid emergencyIMF calls on El Salvador to drop Bitcoin as legal tender,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The building is being taken over by an art and drama group which, I believe, will have access to the required funding for a proper refurbishment.“We regard this as an exciting opportunity to literally move on to a site nearer the city centre, and we are most grateful that the Great Victoria Street Church is giving us such a warm welcome.“Our closing service this Sunday will include a number of special guests including several of our former ministers, and the Presbyterian Moderator, the Right Reverend Dr Bruce. It will certainly be a landmark occasion, and for some people an emotional occasion as well.”Over the years Windsor church, on the corner of the Lisburn Road and Derryvolgie Avenue, amalgamated with others in the South Belfast Presbytery. In  it merged with the former Broadway Presbyterian Church on the Falls Road, which is now an Irish Language Centre. Recently the Windsor members shared an Irish language service of worship at the centre.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Then in , Windsor amalgamated with Ulsterville Presbyterian Church on the Lisburn Road. Cecil Graham, a longtime Presbyterian and elder at Windsor said: “In  in response to the increasing number of immigrants coming to Belfast, the South Belfast Presbytery in partnership with the Council for Mission in Ireland established the International Meeting Point project on the Lisburn Road.“Partnership with the IMP has been instrumental in reviving the Windsor congregation, and many of its members attend our Sunday services.” In its heyday, Windsor was one of the most fashionable and influential Presbyterian churches in Ireland. Two of its ministers became moderators — Rev John Irwin in  and Rev William Corkey in . The Corkey family in particular made a signicant contribution to the wider work of the Church, including the establishment of Adelaide House and other care homes.Windsor church has also made an important contribution to the Mission Outreach of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and particularly in China and India. During the Second World War, Windsor missionaries were imprisonment by the Japanese.It has had eight ministers in its history, including Rev Steen.The church is on the list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. It was designed in  by the architects Young and MacKenzie who also designed the Robinson and Cleaver building opposite Belfast City Hall.Most ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinTop VideosPlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayInterview: Doug Beattie implores people not to judge him by his pastLatest Northern IrelandNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today Family urges revamp of  sat-nav system to aid response timesSuzanne BreenOpinionDoug Beattie gets vital second chance … now he must prove party made right callHands up: Fteen NI venues back open this week for party-goersGet paid to watch Derry Girls  A grand idea...LatestIMF calls on El Salvador to drop Bitcoin as legal tenderBentley to make first pure electric car in CreweCompetition watchdog intervenes in National Express and Stagecoach tie-upUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirms she will seek re-electionPets at Home set for profit boost but supply chain costs increase,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

NIAS is finalising arrangements for a fleet-wide software update to its satellite navigation system commencing February .“NIAS is aware that responses to emergency calls in rural and isolated areas provide challenges in terms of speed of response.“We also recognise the concern experienced by anyone waiting for an ambulance to arrive when that response seems longer than they would have anticipated.“NIAS prioritises calls based on clinical need, with immediately le-threatening calls receiving our highest categorisation of call.“We will always seek to ensure that the sickest patients receive the quickest response.”Danuta also aims to help as many people as possible in rural communities become trained in first aid, and wants every rural area to have a defibrillatorMost ReadDoug Beattie’s tweets: What he said then and his explanations nowFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots issues defamation proceedings against Doug Beattie and Tory MP Simon Hoare over offensive tweet about his weOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalI’ve finally found love again, reveals NI granddaughter of film legend Charlie ChaplinTop VideosPlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s wePlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today Doors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchSuzanne BreenOpinionDoug Beattie gets vital second chance … now he must prove party made right callHands up: Fteen NI venues back open this week for party-goersGet paid to watch Derry Girls  A grand idea...LatestIMF calls on El Salvador to drop Bitcoin as legal tenderBentley to make first pure electric car in CreweCompetition watchdog intervenes in National Express and Stagecoach tie-upUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirms she will seek re-electionPets at Home set for profit boost but supply chain costs increase,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

those to retweet the offensive post was Mr Hoare, who is chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster.Solicitors acting for Mr Poots and his we Glynis are examining the accounts

our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In a precedent setting  High Court case, Tory peer Lord McAlpine was successful in defamation proceedings against users who retweeted untrue allegations of child sex abuse.Among those who had to pay out were Sally Bercow, we of then Commons Speaker John Bercow, and the comedian Alan Davies.Lord McAlpine’s legal counsel said at the time the latter’s “reckless retweet” of a defamatory statement “fanned the work of internet trolls”.Lord McAlpine initiated, or at least threatened, legal action against  Twitter users, with it being accepted by the court that the retweeting of a libel was actionable.Mr Beattie is still in his job despite dozens of other derogatory messages dating back to  coming to light, some containing racist, misogynist and Islamophobic slurs, as well as offensive posts about the Traveller community.On the same day the Poots tweet was posted, an opinion poll for the Belfasthad him as the most popular party leader.He has since said the posts were “pretty horric” and he was “deeply ashamed” of them.However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist.Mr Beattie insisted the tweets were “not who I am”.Mrs Poots, a Sunday school teacher, has always shunned the limelight.She was said to be deeply upset by the Ulster Unionist leader’s post.Mr Poots originally said he accepted Mr Beattie’s apology, but he questioned his “poor” judgment in posting it in the first place.But now it has been confirmed that he is taking legal action over the post.Patrick Higgins, from solicitors Donnelly and Wall, said yesterday: “Today we instigated proceedings on behalf or Mrs and Mr Poots against Mr Beattie MLA and Mr Hoare MP who published this tweet.“This post constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients’ reputation.“As a couple of  years, married for , it has caused my clients profound distress.“As a lady who has recently retired after dedicating her le as a nurse to caring for terminally ill children, it is wholly inappropriate for any persons to make such comments, and the publication has caused immense hurt to her, her husband and their family.”Following a meeting of Ulster Unionist MLAs and party officers yesterday, it was announced Mr Beattie would remain as leader.He said: “I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them, and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader — overwhelmingly, every one of them said ‘yes, I did’.”While there has been no public statement from senior elected members, some of the party’s junior members have come out in support.Kate Evans, who works in Mr Beattie’s constituency office, posted online that she had worked for the Upper Bann MLA for six years, adding: “I wouldn’t be the person I am todayit weren’t for his support and encouragement over those years as I recovered from domestic violence.“I don’t recognise the man in those tweets.“I accept his apology and I support him.”Julie-Anne Corr-Johnson, who joined the UUP last year as a North Belfast representative, said: “There is no other leader I trust more with my children’s future than @BeattieDoug.”Bethany Ferris, a party officer, said: “Everyone has a past.

pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that

extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say

Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

Rabbits instinctively freeze when caught in a beam of light making them sitting targets for anyone with a shotgun.However, the sudden spread of the problem has alarmed the RUC which is appealing for people not to take part in what is regarded as a ldquohighly dangerous occupation.COMBER ndash Plans for the second stage of the Comber by-pass have been postponed for four years, it has been revealed.Strangford Ulster Unionist MP, Mr John Taylor, said he has been informed of the decision which he says has left him ldquoshell-shocked.ldquoTogether with local councillors and Comber businessmen I have been campaigning for many years to get the by-pass built. It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week. They are also to seek a meeting with planners to outline their case.SAINTFIELD ndash Damage to Saintfieldrsquos century-old floral farm cart at the weekend has infuriated village residents and especially the members of the pioneering Bloom committee.The celebrated cart, laden with polyanthus, pansies and spring flowers, had its shafts broken at the body when it was lted from its perch and ped to the ground before midnight on Saturday.In December it was removed to the side of the Orange Hall and behind locked gates to make space for the Christmas tree.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

It is making a very clear statement.”The exercise is located over the site of many of the EU’s transatlantic communication cables, which Russia knows how to tap for information, he adds.”Russia is reasserting its position and the timing is to split the UK, US and NATO surveillance abilities as it is doing so many similar exercises around the globe at the same time.”He iscertain it is all linked to what Russia is trying to achieve in Ukraine.“The Republic of Ireland’s military capabilities are completely useless in this environment. They do not have the ability from an intelligence view to monitor Russian movement around the Irish coast. Russian missile submarines spend a lot of time off the west coast of Ireland and the Republic does not have the ability to see, stop or disrupt this.“That is why when it comes to the protection of Irish air space they rely on the RAF to do so. There is an agreement in place between the Republic of Ireland and the UK for the RAF to provide that air cover.“There are similar arrangements in place with the Royal Navy. The Republic of Ireland does not pay for this protection but it is also protecting the UK’s flank, he notes.“This is where Northern Ireland is critical to the defence of the UK, from a geographic position, in being able to give it a foothold and extra reach out into the Atlantic.”The strategic position of NI for the defence of the UK is something that will “always be a consideration” to the UK government should there be a border poll, he adds.He believes Russia will invade Ukraine.“I personally think yes, they will.”The motivation is that Ukraine has been moving closer ideologically to the EU and Russia is afraid of it becoming part of NATO.Russia is exploitingthe Republic of Ireland, he says, because it cannot monitor its own waters or airspace and has weak immigration controls, so it presents a weak flank of NATO.“The Republic presents a focal point for Russian or other malign actors to either get into the EU or penetrate into the UK and wider NATO by getting intelligence agents into Ireland and therefore into the EU.”Weak passport controls allow Russian agents to enter the UK via the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, he says. Agents will also move from the Republic into France and the rest of the EU, especially on a  passport.“For many years intelligence agents around the world saw an Irish passport as the ‘go to’ second passport that intelligence agents had.People from so many parts of the world now hold Irish passports legitimately, he says, so it is a good cover.“It was always seen as a relatively easy place to get a legitimate passport from.”ButRussian agents inside NI are also “%” also an issue right now, he says.“They will be interested in any defence industries, military bases, shipyards. They will also be looking at anything they can do to disrupt normal government activity both north and south.”One example of this could be through dis-and-misinformation - for example stimulating support for a border poll, or support for loyalist or republican terrorist organisations, he says.“If they feel that it undermines Westminster or Dublin or the EU’s focus away from Russian activities, Russia will put its kne in that crack and wiggle it away as much aspossible.”Russian agents will also be likely to try and exacerbate any social grievances which might result in street protests, “at the very least through social media” he adds.Russian agents in NI are likely to speak without any accent and hold non-Russian passports. Traditionally their cover story is working as junior embassy staff, business executives or journalists.Their preferred agents to recruit may have roles such as engineers or computer experts in sensitivebusinesses or industries.Russian intelligence officers will “%” have people inside NI political parties and may fund political activities from front companies, he adds. The agents these officers run will also be locals who they recruit inside defence manufacturers in NI, for example.Russia had close links with Libya when it was supplying shiploads of mainly Soviet weaponry to the IRA, he notes.“They will be interested in exacerbating political conflict. That will be a definite aim of Russian intelligence services because it splits political thinking in Westminster and fixes it onto something , which then can’t be spent on supporting NATO, the EU or looking at the Russian threat.”They will be aiming to do this from both sides of the political spectrum at the same time in NI, he says, as well as in the south.As to spotting agents, he advises, “If you have a gut feeling something is wrong there could well be something wrong. So MI have got a hotline numberpeople are concerned about anything.”There are more Russian intelligenceofficers in the UK now than during the height of the ColdWar, he says, which would have been “several hundred” at that time.UUP MLA and former Royal Navy submarine commanderSteve Aiken says the exercise off the coast of Cork is the Russians “making very clear to NATO but more importantly to the EU that they can signicantly disrupt business and trade the economies of Europe”.The giveaway, he says, is that they are exercising above a number of keytransatlantic communication cables.”They are demonstrating their capability, bearing in mind that NATO are sending their standing forces into the Black Sea at the moment That would be seen by the Russians as a direct provocation to their intentions in the Ukraine.“But by carrying out exercises in the Atlantic, Mediterraneanand Arctic at the same time, the Russians are demonstrating their capability to be able to inflict as much damage to Europe as NATO could do to Russia.”The Republic of Ireland has acknowledged that it “can’t do anything” about the Russian exercises off its coast, he says.“This is particularlytrue as the Irish have no maritime or air capability whatsoever [in proportion to this threat]. I think the Russians are just demonstrating they can operate with impunity.“I would say it would be extraordinarily embarrassing when Simon Coveney calls in the Russian ambassadorto complain about something - but what is he going to do about it  He has no air capability and no maritime capability.”In the event of a threat to the Irish Republic from something such as a hijacked aircraft, he says, “they would have to call up the RAF to come and deal with it. They have no capability at all.”The Republic of Ireland only has radar around its airports but has no means to detect hostile aircraft around its coast or anywhere , he says.“They are quite unique in European terms in their limited military capability, aside from Malta. Every other EU countryinvests quite considerably in its defence capabilities.”The defence question should be a signicant consideration for anyone voting in a border poll, he says.“Of course. To me that has always been the case.”The UK’s presence in Northern Ireland is critical in its defence plans, he says.“One of the reasons the UK has managed to maintain its security is because it always controlled the sea lanes and airspace around and over Ireland.”As to whether Russia will invade Ukraine, hesuggests: “We are in a stage where anything could happen.”MORE NEWS:Ex-PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde: The Historical Enquiries Team was closed down to protect terrorists-turned-politiciansPSNI dodges ex-chief constable George Hamilton’s claim about murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuiganPSNI assessment of IRA Army Council relationship with Sinn Fein remains unchanged says Chief Constable Simon ByrnePSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRAYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Mondays to Fridays, from .pm."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13406698.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A lot of people have been enjoying it.“I think we are quite happy going along not worrying about that too much. If we hopefully get through and get to play them in the final, it will be a great situation to be in..remove“Some of it is borderline. I think it is great to have a lot of support and the crowd really getting into it and getting a bit rowdy but you do want them to be respectful of the players as well. Sometimes it’s a bit over the line.” vw,vw,px, px\"Nick Kyrgios has excited the crowds in Melbourne Salisbury and Ram will get a taste of it on Thursday when they meet another Australian duo, Matt Ebden and Max Purcell, who defeated Britain’s Neal Skupski and Dutchman Wesley Koolhof - - - .Skupski had been unbeaten in  having won two titles with new partner Koolhof, and he said: “You don’t really get to play in front of crowds like that for doubles that often.“I spoke to Max Purcell and he said it’s a lot worse playing against Nick and Thanasi. I think it’s good for doubles. It puts a lot more eyes watching doubles. As long as they behave themselves, it should be OK.“So far I think the energy that Nick’s bringing and Kokkinakis is great for doubles. There’s some stuff that you don’t want to be happening on the court and from the crowd but, as long as they keep it PG, it’s only good really.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nick Kyrgios labelled  uan absolute knob u by doubles opponent at Australian Open article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
