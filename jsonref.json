Delta Air Lines and United both said they would waive flight change fees for passengers affected by the winter weather in Chicago (above), Detroit and areas of the Upper Midwest          Snow plows worked around the clock on Monday to remove snow from the tarmac at Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International AirportEven Alabama and Mississippi could see snow. Blizzard conditions were predicted across parts of the western Ohio Valley and snow was expected through Wednesday from the Great Lakes region into New England.States of emergency have been declared from Wisconsin and Michigan, down to Alabama and Mississippi.Parts of north and central Georgia are expecting about 2 inches of snow or more in the coming days, along with freezing rain and ice-slicked highways. Minneapolis Public Schools officials have canceled classes through Wednesday, when the region is expected to experience frigidly low temperatures not seen in a quarter century. Hundreds of Michigan schools were closed Tuesday, including in Detroit, while Chicago Public Schools canceled Wednesday classes because of the anticipated cold snap.\u0027You\u0027re talking about frostbite and hypothermia issues very quickly, like in a matter of minutes, maybe seconds,\u0027 said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.            "},{"url":null,"title":"Estate agents slash luxury house price 100 000 buyers graveyard garden","story":"    This newly-converted house for sale in North Lopham, Norfolk, has a graveyard in its front garden, which has caused estate agents to slash the asking price          In total the former chapel has 36 gravestones marking burial plots in the front garden as well as 14 leaning against a wallThe house was a chapel until it closed in 2014 due to a dwindling congregation and was bought in October 2016 for £246,000 by local property developer Sam Nayler through his firm SNPD Ltd.It has now been converted into a modern home with a 25ft by 35ft open plan double height living room and kitchen.Estate agents Bedfords are now hoping that buyers will overcome their fears about the graves. Emmerson Dutton, a partner at Bedfords office in Bury St Edmunds office, said: \u0027I am sure that the gravestones have been a factor in putting off some buyers.\u0027It is a very stylish property, but the activity levels around it have certainly been lower than we would expect.          The main living space which has oak flooring includes a kitchen with state of the art cabinets, an island, granite work tops and a range-style oven   The first floor has a galleried landing around three sides of the building which Bedfords say could be used as a playroom, study areas or hobby space\u0027I think the people who are concerned about the graves don\u0027t go as far as asking for a viewing. We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.\u0027But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via driveway on the side.\u0027It means that people don\u0027t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.\u0027Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.\u0027 The house was originally up for sale at £595,000 with a different agent before it was taken on by Bedfords who cut the price to £550,000, before cutting it again.          The home has been converted into a modern and spacious property with a 25ft by 35ft open plan double height living room and kitchenMr Dutton believes the house is worth at least £100,000 more than its price tag due. He said: \u0027It just seems buyers are put off which is such a shame as the cost of the conversion far outweighs the price it\u0027s for sale for.\u0027Someone is going to get a real bargain. It might be that once a year, on Halloween, it becomes an issue but most people could live with that.\u0027Plot of land overlooking Clifton Suspension Bridge with...Watch out for Whiteout Wednesday!

I would not be able to sleep at night knowing the graves were in the garden.\u0027But local resident Gwen Dilloway, 65, added: \u0027It wouldn\u0027t bother me in the slightest. People who are dead and in the ground are not going to do me any harm.\u0027Retired police worker Miker Warner, 74, who lives nearby said: \u0027I have only known three people come round to view the house since it went on the market.          There is a good-sized garden at the rear of the property with a double cart lodge. The house was a chapel until it closed in 2014 due to its dwindling congregation          The price of the Grade Two listed home - which dates back to 1810 - has been slashed by Bedfords estate agents by more than £100,000 to £490,000\u0027It seems that most people don\u0027t like the idea of the gravestones. It is a bit of a downside if you are trying to sell a property.\u0027I have got no problem with it because it is all part of the village structure and history.\u0027All the graves date back to the 19th century. The graveyard at the chapel filled up in the 1870s and worshippers were then laid to rest in the Church of England church which has its graveyard owned by the parish council.\u0027There was a petition lodged with Breckland Council to remove the headstones but it was turned down as it was decided they were part of the village fabric.\u0027I don\u0027t think there is anyone in the village now who is related to the people buried there.\u0027The only people you see visiting the graves are people who are researching their family trees.\u0027          Despite its modern and high quality finish, buyers have been spooked by more than 20 old headstones and tombs covering the front lawn of the three bedroom house at North Lopham near Diss, Norfolk          Although some local residents said they would not be put off the property because of the graves, others admitted they would not be able to sleep in the former chapel "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/29/20/00B3E58300000578-6645751-image-m-14_1548792263491.jpg","title":"Sir David Attenborough says politicians learn scientists","story":"    Sir David Attenborough (pictured) said politicians could learn from scientific collaboration, in a speech at Westminster while MPs squabbled over Brexit Describing how many nations were interested in Antarctica six decades ago, including Norway, France, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina, he said countries had worked together with an \u0027urge to take a scientific approach\u0027.  He said: \u0027Living down there, researching down there is hard enough... let us get together and make a treaty, in which there will be a series of idealistic commands.\u0027We will stop squabbling among ourselves and different nationalities, we will establish bases and will welcome anybody from any other base to our base to see what we are doing.\u0027Under the Antarctic Treaty, signed by 12 countries in December 1959, it was agreed that the continent should be used for peaceful purposes, military practices were prohibited and scientific collaboration was encouraged.Sir David said the treaty had no end and would \u0027go on for eternity\u0027, adding: \u0027Marvellous ideals make the pulse quicken in this day of squabbling that we have got going on in the world today.\u0027Exposed: The myth that the world is going to hell!

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.    Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London. Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!?’British Tennis also sent out a tweet in support, saying: ‘Good luck in your recovery from hip resurfacing surgery Andy!’"},{"url":null,"title":"1 000 flights canceled U S winter storms","story":"    Air traffic across the country has been affected by the frigid weather with 1,200 flights canceled by Tuesday morning.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn finally clambered off the fence and announced he would back the amendments against no deal - but his effort failed as the main Cooper amendment was defeated Amendments from Mr Corbyn and SNP leader Ian Blackford were both dispatched with ease - 327 MPs filed into the Government lobby both times, enough to win any vote.The third vote was crucial as a plan from Tory MP Dominic Grieve - to hand MPs the power to debate and vote on Brexit every Tuesday until there is a deal - was tested.Fifteen Conservative MPs rebelled - the usual Remain rebels including Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - but they were cancelled out by 14 Labour MPs. The Labour group included Brexit supporters like Kate Hoey and Dennis Skinner, and those from Leave-voting areas like Caroline Flint.It meant the Government won again - 321 to 301 - and by a bigger margin than many had expected.It set the stage for the Cooper amendment to fail in the fourth vote of the night. This time 17 Tories rebelled but again they were cancelled out by the same bloc of 14 Labour MPs.Ms Cooper\u0027s plan lost by a slightly larger margin of 321 to 298 - a majority of 23 and a clear signal the Commons would back Mrs May to renegotiate the deal.A fifth vote on an amendment from Rachel Reeves - to make a political statement saying the same as Ms Cooper\u0027s proposed law - was seen off 322-290.The sixth vote on Dame Caroline Spelman\u0027s amendment tarnished the night for Mrs May.The amendment set out a statement that a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable - but made no effort to change the law or force the Government to do anything.The same 17 Conservative MPs rebelled to support the motion but this time only three Labour MPs went the other way.It meant the rebels won 318 to 310 - a symbolic blow to Mrs May that could encourage the EU not to give ground in any new negotiations.But it did not stop Mrs May securing the most important victory of the night when the Brady amendment was finally called to a vote at 8.26pm.    The results meant Theresa May could return to the Despatch Box at 8.41pm to hail a way forward on Brexit The motion carried 317 to 301, with just eight Tory rebels voting against sending Mrs May back for a final push on the border backstop.Seven Labour MPs voted the other way, joining forces with all 10 DUP MPs and three Independents to get Mrs May over the line.She told the Commons: \u0027A fortnight ago, this House clearly rejected the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration with just 202 members voting in favour.\u0027Tonight a majority of Honourable Members have said they would support a deal with changes to the backstop.\u0027Combined with measures to address concerns over Parliament’s role in the negotiation of the future relationship and commitments on workers’ rights, in law where need be, it is now clear that there is a route that can secure a substantial and sustainable majority in this House for leaving the EU with a deal.\u0027We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u0027    SIR GRAHAM BRADY\u0027S PLAN TO FIX THE BACKSTOP BY DEMANDING CHANGES FROM THE EU - BACKED BY MAYWHAT IT DOES: Proposes replacing the Northern Ireland backstop with \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027 to avoid a hard border.

Maduro, speaking from the presidential palace in front of press, military and government officials, broadcast his comments across all radio and television airwaves and channels, showcasing his total control over the state apparatus despite Guaido\u0027s claims to legitimacyThe move would \u0027protect Venezuela\u0027s patrimony from further theft by Maduro\u0027s corrupt regime,\u0027 according to the statement, calling out President Nicolas Maduro\u0027s government.\u0027This certification will help Venezuela\u0027s legitimate government safeguard those assets for the benefit of the Venezuelan people,\u0027 it continued. Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek Saab said he had asked the Supreme Court to open a preliminary investigation into Guaido, accusing him of helping foreign countries to interfere in internal matters. He also asked the court to impose a travel ban on the 35-year-old leader and to freeze his bank accounts. Bolton responded by warning of \u0027serious consequences,\u0027 while state-run oil company PDVSA sought to sidestep U.S. sanctions.In another sign of support, Vice President Mike Pence met with Guaido\u0027s newly named acting Charge d\u0027affaires Carlos Alfredo Vecchio. He said at the White House Tuesday his nation had a \u0027unique opportunity\u0027 now after 20 years of fighting for democracy.\u0027We have a united opposition right now...we have a strong national assembly....and we have the democratic world backing us, supporting our agenda, so this is a unique opportunity,\u0027 he said.\u0027This is a fight between a dictatorship, which is totally controlled by the Cuban regime, against the free world. We cannot do this alone,\u0027 he added.The sweeping sanctions on PDVSA, announced on Monday and aimed at curbing crude exports to the United States and driving Maduro from power, were the strongest measures yet against the 56-year-old former union leader who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years.GRAPHIC-Sanctions on Venezuela\u0027s oil firm sends U.S....Court bars Venezuela opposition leader from leaving nation0-Oil prices up 2 pct following U.S. sanctions on VenezuelaShare this articleThe measures triggered higher global oil prices, angry responses from China and Russia and the first serious moves against Guaido since he challenged Maduro\u0027s claim on the presidency last week.The United States and several other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate head of state and denounced Maduro as a usurper.

We will keep acting and working to confront the humanitarian crisis,\u0027 Guaido told a news conference.Most experts believe the sanctions and other measures against Maduro will encourage him to step down only if he loses the support of the powerful military, which until now has been mostly loyal to the leftist ruling party founded by late President Hugo Chavez.Maduro appeared on a television broadcast from a military base on Tuesday, praising the soldiers\u0027 loyalty.As a lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, Guaido has immunity from prosecution unless ordered by a top court. However, the Supreme Court is loyal to Maduro and is expected to quickly open the investigation.The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had certified Guaido\u0027s authority to control certain assets held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or other U.S.-insured banks, including government and central bank accounts.SIDESTEPPING SANCTIONSPDVSA responded to the sanctions by ordering customers with tankers waiting to load crude destined for the United States to prepay, according to sources. Such prepayment could be in violation of the sanctions, setting the stage for a standoff at the ports.PDVSA is also seeking to sidestep the sanctions by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, sources said.The Kremlin condemned the sanctions as illegal interference, while China said they would lead to suffering for which Washington would bear responsibility.

Emmerson Dutton, a partner at Bedfords office in Bury St Edmunds office, said: \u0027I am sure that the gravestones have been a factor in putting off some buyers.\u0027It is a very stylish property, but the activity levels around it have certainly been lower than we would expect.          The main living space which has oak flooring includes a kitchen with state of the art cabinets, an island, granite work tops and a range-style oven   The first floor has a galleried landing around three sides of the building which Bedfords say could be used as a playroom, study areas or hobby space\u0027I think the people who are concerned about the graves don\u0027t go as far as asking for a viewing. We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.\u0027But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via driveway on the side.\u0027It means that people don\u0027t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.\u0027Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.\u0027 The house was originally up for sale at £595,000 with a different agent before it was taken on by Bedfords who cut the price to £550,000, before cutting it again.

The Spelman amendment, after all, is not legally binding.There has been a great deal of talk in recent weeks that Parliament itself would take control of the Brexit process from Theresa May and Downing Street.Last night the exact opposite happened. Theresa May took back control of Brexit from Parliament. As a result, she looks more secure in her job than she has done for a very long time.Nor was that vital strategic win the only matter for Downing Street celebration. As Tory MPs united behind Mrs May’s deal, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party split wide open as a dozen Labour rebels defied a three-line Labour whip over the Cooper amendment and thereby saved Mrs May’s skin – just. New mother is slapped with a $170 parking fine while she was...PG\u0026E files for bankruptcy citing mounting lawsuits from...Share this articleBut I would warn against too much exultation in Downing Street. The Prime Minister has paid a price for her victory in terms of personal reputation and credibility.Let’s not forget her new strategy involves going back to the deal she defended for so long – one she agreed with the 27 other nations of the EU less than two months ago.Before Christmas, Theresa May signed up for the so-called ‘Irish backstop’. This gave a guarantee that there would never be border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.But the plan was hated by Brexiteering Conservative MPs because they feared the European Union would use the backstop as a device to keep Britain in the European customs union for ever.After days of frantic backstairs plotting, Mrs May has won their support by promising to ditch the backstop. She will now ask to open negotiations with Europe for so-called ‘alternative arrangements’.    Theresa May headed off the concerted attempt by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles to seize back control for Parliament todayBy doing so, she’s kept Britain on course to leave the European Union on March 29, just 58 days from now. However – and I say this with a heavy heart as a supporter of the PM – last night’s victory has come at the cost of a pretty dramatic U-turn from the PM.She has only secured her survival by scrapping a deal which she personally agreed to barely eight weeks ago. Back then, remember, she insisted that the backstop was unchangeable.Now she appears to believe that it can be rewritten after all. What is more, Mrs May seems to think that she can do this in the next two weeks, having promised to come back to the Commons by February 13 for a second ‘meaningful vote’.To many this looks like dreamland, for many in Brussels will take a dim view of Britain’s decision to renege on a deal that was struck last year – and go back demanding changes.It needs to be said that Mrs May is not the only one who has shifted their position. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is equally guilty.He hypocritically opposed Mrs May’s proposal last night, even though he was actually against the backstop in the first place!Last night, Mrs May criticised Mr Corbyn for facing both ways over Brexit. So what next? What follows in the coming days is essentially an almighty act of brinkmanship.          Earlier in the evening, President Macron warned that there would be no renegotiation on the backstopThe Prime Minister must now set herself directly at odds with the European Union.Essentially, she is making the brutal calculation that the EU leaders will dump the backstop by renegotiating the agreement.Last night, all the indications were that they would refuse to do so. Earlier in the evening, President Macron warned that there would be no renegotiation on the backstop. His words were endorsed shortly after the vote by the EU president Donald Tusk, who announced that ‘the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation’.This means we have entered terrifyingly unpredictable territory. The possibility of a No Deal Brexit has suddenly become far more likely, with all the potentially catastrophic consequences of economic meltdown it involves. No wonder sterling was falling in value last night.Mrs May has opened herself to the charge of putting the Tory party before the country. Perhaps she will not mind that too much.Don’t underestimate the depth of the fears that the party could split in two between hardline Brexiteers and the rest as a consequence of Brexit. That outcome has now been postponed, though not put off altogether.So Mrs May’s triumph is far from complete. With less than ten weeks to go till Brexit Day, there is still a great deal to be achieved. What if the EU keeps to its word and refuses to budge?There may yet be a mighty arm-wrestle to come. There will be celebration in Downing Street today, but I predict it won’t last long as minds turn to the battle ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"Not grrreat Labour pushes ban Tony Tiger cartoon characters cereal packets","story":"    Tony The Tiger, the advertising cartoon mascot for Kellogg\u0027s Frosted Flakes, made his first appearance in 1951.

I know, because I’ve taken part in public debates to put its case – without anyone from the museum to back me up – most recently at University College London, which is so close to the museum that its curators would have only needed to pop around the corner to say their piece.Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, has just broken with this policy of saying nothing and hoping the museum’s critics will go away. He has given an uninhibited interview to the Greek newspaper Ta Nea, in which he makes an intellectual argument for keeping the sculptures where they are. And he has used an incendiary word that has unleashed a torrent of outrage.In the interview – and to avoid repeating any mistranslations, I am quoting a text provided to me by the British Museum – Fischer claims that moving these and other objects from their original place into a museum in another part of the world can be “creative”.“When you move cultural heritage into a museum, you move it out of context,” he says. “Yet that displacement is also a creative act, and each encounter with it is potentially a creative act.”This may seem provocative. Is he actually claiming that when Elgin got his workmen to physically remove a huge part of the sculptures from the Parthenon temple, after doing a dodgy deal with the Ottoman empire that was oppressing Greece at the time, and ship them to London, this act of daylight robbery was creative? Try asking that another way. Was it creative when British soldiers destroyed the royal city of Benin, west Africa, in 1897 and looted the great brass plaques from its palace, many of which are in the British Museum? Or when Hitler planned a new museum to house the looted art of Europe?Emotion is easy and thinking is hard. The campaign to return Elgin’s booty to Greece has run on passion for 200 years, ever since Lord Byron denounced Elgin in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. Today, this oldest of all cultural property protests has become emblematic of a wider outrage that sees many museum treasures, such as the British Museum’s Rapa Nui stone figure, as nothing more than imperial theft. There is a mood to support any and all such restitution claims – Jeremy Corbyn would return the Parthenon sculptures, no question – so for Fischer to call museums’ appropriation of other peoples’ art “creative” is bound to start a fire.Yet, if you don’t see his case, you are ultimately saying there shouldn’t be any world museums and every work of art should stay in its original location, as it only has meaning in its original context. If you follow this through to its logical conclusion, there should be no international sharing of images and ideas. Every altar piece in the National Gallery would have to go back to the church it was made for. That’s a terrifying plan to intellectually shrink our species in a myriad of mental Brexits.Those who argue for the return of the Parthenon sculptures and any other such restitution need to be clear that in attacking the dream of the world museum you are assaulting the heritage of the Enlightenment. Museums make us see more, they let us explore connections. Visit the British Museum’s Islamic gallery and you can see how Islamic art drew on the classical heritage of which the Parthenon sculptures are the summit. You can see the same influence in its early Buddhist art. Only a collection like that of the British Museum opens up these bigger ways of seeing.Creative? Actually, yes. The generosity and scope of a museum on the British Museum’s scale expands our horizons. It seems to me that there are two fundamental errors in the case to return the Parthenon treasures. One is the notion that ancient Greece, a civilisation that flourished 2,500 years ago, is somehow the cultural possession of modern Greece, that its achievements belong to Greece in some narrow national way. If that were true, no one outside Greece would study mathematics, philosophy or history, see a play, or do a scientific experiment – for all these fundamental human pursuits were invented by the ancient Greeks.The other is that placing these sculptures in the British Museum expressed contempt for Greece. In fact, it was an act of reverence. These masterpieces came to London at the height of neoclassicism, when the civilisation of ancient Greece was seen as the fount of all wisdom, beauty and truth.There’s a simple proof that putting this art in the British Museum was indeed creative. John Keats, unlike the aristocratic Lord Byron, was neither rich nor healthy enough to sail to Greece. But when he saw the Parthenon frieze in London it inspired him, in his Ode on a Grecian Urn, to describe its tragic image of a cow being led to slaughter:“To what green altar, O mysterious priest,Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?”If it’s not creative to inspire one of the greatest poets in the English language, what is? Greece has Byron on its side. The British Museum has Keats (not to mention Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in the same years wrote Ozymandias about another marvel in its collection).Fischer has been brave to stick his head over the parapet and say what he thinks. He’s the internationalist liberal in this debate. The passionate proponents of Greece’s claim need to explain how their argument differs from any other variety of nationalist populism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fcbedbcffdd00f07d144c11f0605379a35e79c/0_105_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d3e28315f1d070ea3095ebc46528f6","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Jonathan Rendall’s This Bloody Mary Is The Last Thing I Own: A Journey To The End Of Boxing is, according to EstelleMoon, “one of the all time book titles”. It is also:A fantastic account of the author’s life in the boxing world, primarily as a journalist and writer but also as a manager for Colin “Sweet C” Macmillan in the early 90s. It takes us from Rendall’s childhood, fervently watching boxing on the TV and buying Ring magazine, to working for that same magazine staying in grubby Las Vegas hotels tracking down long-lost fighters in Cuba seeking out young upcoming talent, dealing with violence both in and out of the ring ... and ends with his eventual disillusionment with the whole game, and some hard-won realisations about life. It’s a brilliant book, written with real verve, and shot through with sadness, nostalgia and faded glory.The Warden by Anthony Trollope has been “much enjoyed” by vermontlogger:Quite apart from the inherent satisfaction of a story about a good man acting in accordance with his conscience – against the advice of all rational men! – there is Trollope’s comical satirising of secondary figures, which I had quite forgotten. We have, among others, Dr Pessimist Anticant, the Scottish thinker whose charm lasts only so long as he chooses to remain “vague, mysterious, and cloudy”, and Mr Popular Sentiment, the novelist whose “good poor people are so very good” and “hard rich people so very hard”, and Sir Abraham Haphazard, Attorney-General, with his bill to institute the bodily searching of nuns for Jesuitical symbols.A “pleasant surprise” for tiojo, in the form of Anthony Quinn’s The Rescue Man:A novel conjured from the little that is known of the life of a nineteenth century Liverpool architect. Peter Ellis’s most outstanding work is Oriel Chambers on Water Street in Liverpool. Described by Pevsner as “one of the most remarkable buildings of its date in Europe”.The author fictionalises him as ‘Peter Eames’ and sets the story a century later during the Blitz with the main character an architectural historian. Novels that have a real geographical setting but into which are inserted imaginary places are fascinating. As the story unfolds and locations are described you can picture exactly where the characters are standing. Then they turn a corner and enter an unknown street and an unknown building. You pause for an instant, wonder where you are, put your faith in the author and sit back and enjoy the story. For anyone who knows Liverpool this book is a treat. For those who like a tale of a doomed love affair it’s an equal pleasure.Rotwatcher was given CJ Sansom’s Dominion and is “loving every minute”:It’s an alternative history novel - Britain surrenders after Dunkirk and Churchill goes into hiding as leader of the Resistance. The book is set mainly in smog-bound 1950’s London, and Sansom effortlessly conjures up the privation, fear and horror of living under a regime that is mostly controlled from Berlin. It has rather worrying echoes of where the world is currently headed, with demagogues like Trump, Bolsonaro and others rising like turds in a midden. The style and pace remind me of two of my favourite thriller writers - Roberts Goddard and Harris.Jill Lepore’s The Secret History of Wonder Woman has impressed Veufveuve:I am greatly enjoying this meticulously researched history of the creation of Wonder Woman and her creator, psychologist Dr William Moulton Marston: a man, who despite his oddities (for many years he lived in a ménage-à-trois with his wife and Margaret Sanger’s niece), was deeply immersed in the American suffrage and feminist movements of the early 20th-century and genuinely saw Wonder Woman as a vehicle for a feminist message. Full of fascinating and unexpected detail, it is, as I said, deeply researched and, though I sometimes find Lepore’s writing a little “choppy” and abrupt, a vivid read that pulls the reader along“Righto”, says Appears78, “Murakami. Kafka on the Shore”:First read it back in my late 20s. It was lent to me my an Aussie friend just after I’d moved to Istanbul. It was a good time in my life. I remember liking it. The novel and life.Didn’t like anything else I’ve read of his since very much, so wasn’t sure how going back to it would be. And it was enjoyable - a guilty pleasure for the most part. Granted, sometimes his style reads a little like Enid Blyton with sexy bits, but there were various parts of it that were fairly compelling. You know - pageturnery. It was all a touch redolent of faux-intellectualism with its scattergun intertextuality and self-conscious exploration of the boundaries and ambivalences between dream and reality, symbols and tangibles, and space and time, but again, I found myself not really caring all that much…There’s plenty more to say, but I’ll try and keep it brief. I think David Mitchell ided the readers of this novel into three groups: the fanboys and girls, the critically approving, and the skeptics. I’m in the middle, I reckon.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Total tried to find gas in the area twice before, in 2017, but without success.Kevin Swann, a senior analyst with the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, said the size of find was “pretty significant” and he believed the field could be producing gas within 4 to 5 years via the existing Elgin–Franklin rigs.The gas is in a reservoir with high pressure and high temperatures, meaning it will be more costly to produce than other gasfields. But Swann said the scale of the reservoir meant it would be economically viable to extract.“The company needs to spend a lot more money on safety features and processing,” he said.The Oil and Gas Authority, said the the discovery was “very exciting news”.Andy Samuel, the chief executive of the regulator, said the UK continental shelf still held an estimated 10bn-20bn barrels of oil and gas, “so there is every chance of yet more significant finds”.The number of new wells being drilled has fallen in recent years in 2018 it fell to a level last seen in 1965. However, the amount of oil and gas found has increased from 83m barrel of oil equivalent in 2014 to 175m in 2017.Experts said the industry was experiencing an uptick as it recovered from the 2014-2016 slump in oil prices.Two of the potential big new finds in 2019 are the Leon and Blackrock projects being drilled by the private equity-backed firm Siccar Point. “There’s certainly a rejuvenation. Companies are focusing on better prospects, rather than drilling everything,” said Swann.Friends of the Earth called on the government to stop supporting new fossil fuel infrastructure. “It’s a disgrace that oil and gas exploration is still going ahead in the seas off Scotland,” said Caroline Rance, a climate campaigner at the group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89cafeab8ce1c4c839dd170780552ad2bffb4538/0_347_4807_2883/master/4807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e292948bdbfaab2a4c867f80a8fb93b","title":"patisserie valerie accounts unreliable back to 2014","story":"Potential buyers told sales and profit data from December 2014-October 2018 unreliableAccounts for Patisserie Valerie dating back to at least September 2014 contain unreliable figures on its financial performance, according to information sent to potential bidders for the stricken cafe chain.Interested parties have been asked to put forward first round bids by Friday but so far have only limited information about the recent trading performance at the company, which fell into administration this month.Sources told the  that information sent to bidders by KPMG, which is acting as administrator, indicated only sales and profit data from after October 2018 or before September 2014 could be relied upon.One source said potential buyers were “flying blind” on the details to some extent because of potential irregularities in the accounts.Patisserie Valerie has been in crisis since October, when the company said it had uncovered a £40m black hole in its finances, which it blamed on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities.About 70 of the cafe group’s nearly 200 outlets and concessions closed immediately, with the loss of about 900 jobs.

Its secret? Cutting-edge VFX and filming in multiple languagesby  Tash Reith-Banks in HyderabadIt is rush hour on Monday morning in Hyderabad, but the city’s usual deafening soundtrack of revving engines and blaring horns is absent. The only noise comes from a woman gently sweeping the veranda of one of the large, pastel-coloured mansions nearby. The silence is even more disconcerting when you see the airport near the end of the street, and, just beyond that, a railway station. New York’s Statue of Liberty is a short walk away, as is the splendour of the ancient city of Mahishmati. In fact, Mahishmati is the first place here where I encounter any real noise – the blue special effects screens around the fibreglass throne area are rather flimsy, and a buzz from power tools carries from the adjoining parking lot, where workers are building a pirate ship.We are in Ramoji Film City, the largest film studio in the world and the beating heart of Tollywood, India’s Telugu-language film industry. And although Ramoji is technically part of Hyderabad, in reality – with its (real) hotels, workshops, soundstages, gardens, post office, banks and restaurants – it is a metropolis in and of itself.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.It is not Hyderabad’s only “city within a city”. To many outside India, the southern Indian metropolis is best known for Hitech City – the country’s own purpose-built Silicon Valley. Nearby is Genome Valley, which boasts manufacturing and R\u0026ampD arms of some of the biotech sector’s biggest names.Hyderabad owes much of its rapid growth to the jobs created for these companies, both directly and from the construction boom resulting from the need for offices, homes and infrastructure to accommodate the influx of labour. Its expansion has seen it swallow up its twin city of Secunderabad to become one sprawling metropolis.The latest UN projections forecast that Hyderabad will reach megacity status – having a population over 10 million – by 2020, with 14.1 million residents by 2035. But when you are caught in the inevitable snarl of the city’s legendarily bad traffic and surrounded on all sides by construction projects, it is hard not to agree with locals who say that, thanks to unofficial migrant workers, the 10 million population point has long since been passed.India has the largest film industry in the world, producing 1,903 films in 2016 compared with 200 made in Britain and 798 made in the US. The Hindi-language output of Bollywood, with its bright colours, catchy soundtracks and spectacular dance sequences, is the first – and sometimes only – thing that springs to the outsider’s mind when Indian film is mentioned, but Bollywood only accounts for a small proportion of the country’s films. Tollywood’s output is almost as large and the return for investors on each of its pictures tends to be better.Every film studio is a little like a small town, with multiple catering locations, shops, backlots, transport, workshops and security. Studios need space, which is why many UK studios are built on former manor estates or Ministry of Defence airfields, while some of Hollywood’s biggest studios were based around ranches or large colonial mansions. But Hyderabad’s Ramoji Film City dwarfs them all. As well as the standard studio facilities, Ramoji also offers permanent sets including a prison, an elaborate hilltop temple, and a village with a town square. In the west, permanent sets are rare nowadays, partly because of the rise in land prices and taxation in cities like Los Angeles, but also because of their poorly disguised overuse in Hollywood films until the 1970s. (Although Ramoji’s one-stop shop model emulates golden age-era Hollywood, Ramoji was only built in 1996, the same year as Hitech City.)This increasing technical competence is part of what has begun to set Tollywood apart in Indian film, exemplified by the two-part blockbuster Baahubali, filmed at Ramoji, where some of the sets remain as a tourist attraction. Baahubali: The Conclusion is the second highest-grossing Indian film in history, and both parts used visual effects (VFX) to an extent and with a complexity not previously seen in Indian film. Although a number of studios were involved, the main players were based in Hyderabad.Hyderabad, as a magnet for software developers and programmers, has a swiftly growing VFX industry, but on the whole its labs currently deal with less creative and more labour-intensive work outsourced by large western and Chinese companies. Khan says this will change: “We are inculcating VFX artists and VFX supervisors to be on a par with international levels and slowly we’ll see more of work being completely outsourced here. We’re in the transformation stage from being that BT outsource call centre to being the actual customer service.”And as Hyderabad’s IT dominance increases, so too does the number of Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil-speaking workers heading overseas to work for major companies – and their enthusiasm for cinema does not alter with distance. “Today, every filmmaker’s target is diaspora in the US, UK and Europe besides Africa and the Gulf,” explains Murthy. With modern digital distribution methods, this means that more cinemas worldwide are now showing Tollywood’s output, while platforms such as Netflix have massively increased the potential audience.The response to this growth in diaspora audience is increasingly to make films targeted at them. As Murthy points out, Tollywood films are “aimed at satisfying and impressing the diaspora about what they are missing in their native lands. Most of the Telugu films shoot their songs and some sequences in the US or UK or Europe background.” With wider distribution comes a demand for increasingly sophisticated offerings, acknowledges Khan: “Now when our content is going up on, say, Netflix or Amazon, if quality-wise we’re not at par with international content, an Indian viewer also will not watch what we are putting out. You know he has the option of watching Narcos if our crime series is not popular enough.”If Ramoji Film City’s studio-based vision seems old-fashioned to the Netflix generation, this does not appear to trouble owner Ramoji Rao. He is also looking to the digital future with a very real news media empire, centred on three working office blocks that sit amid the studio fakery. There, alongside his newspaper and news TV operations, is a news video app currently in the testing stages. Each Indian state is represented, with its own studio and team of editors and presenters based at Ramoji, while reporters throughout the country send back a stream of national and hyper-local news bulletins. The aim is for any app subscriber to have access to 24-hour news from their home state, in their own language – an ambitious undertaking in a country made up of 29 states with 22 different languages. If the project pays off, it could make Hyderabad not just the film capital of the south, but the media capital of India – and as it takes its place as a megacity, it seems certain to become a serious player on the global stage.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821fcdc0c12eaf62dbd7e02c5010a95a85e592a0/0_137_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a65ca23b9c623f62dca993e7a4d8e760","title":"100 per cent mortgage low income generation rent housing market","story":"By only lending to those whose families can cough up a lump sum, Lloyds Bank is reinforcing the ludicrous housing marketIf there’s anything more British than talking about the weather, it’s obsessing about house prices. This is a country where it’s taboo to ask someone their salary but perfectly acceptable to ask how much their house is worth (and look it up on Rightmove if they won’t tell you).This has created the demographic known as Generation Rent – young adults who are stuck renting, locked out of homeownership and, as we’re so often patronisingly told, are really into avocado-based brunches. In the 1990s someone aged between 25-34 had a two in three chance of owning their own home. By 2016, it was one in four. In a nutshell, your chances of buying a house of your own if you’re a young person on a middle income have more than halved over the past two decades.This has forced ever greater numbers into the private rental sector where tenancies are too short and rents too high.The only thing more overpriced than buying a home right now is renting one. In more than half of the local authorities in England, housing charity Shelter says that rents are unaffordable for ordinary working families. It’s now thought that more than a third of millennials will be renting forever, unable to save for a deposit to buy because so much of their earnings go straight into the pocket of a private landlord.Sounds great, right? How kind of Lloyds to want to help and come to the rescue of Generation Rent like this. Nobody would blame you for jumping at it.Young people whose parents own property are almost three times more likely to become homeowners by the age of 30. The bank of mum and dad has created a two-tier society – those with a family who can help and those without. Today, whether you can buy a house really depends on your family’s wealth unless you earn an above-average salary.As David Cameron himself put it, help to buy was intended “to get the market moving”. With it, the government underwrote an out-of-control housing market (some argue, inflated it further) and lined the pockets of developers, helping those who were gifted deposits or earned enough to save.We are in the middle of a housing crisis because we allowed homes to cost more than the people who need them can afford to pay. The solution cannot be to preserve this ludicrous new normal with more of the same.Instead of finding creative ways to encourage people into more debt to sustain the unsustainable, we need to have ambitious conversations about what is genuinely affordable housing and how we help those without wealthy parents to access it.• Vicky Spratt is a freelance journalist, housing campaigner and author of Tenants: Stories of Britain’s Housing Shame which is being published in 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ae4aaab50f67f7f3ade378f960bd50e64b6ffc/6_491_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71e206e4900b7d4b88f2a659d67c5f4","title":"james charles zoella youtube celebrity culture","story":"When a YouTuber brings Birmingham city centre to a standstill, it’s time to do more than pride yourself on ignoranceThere is a particular breed of middle-aged man that prides itself on not knowing who Kim Kardashian is. “What’s that?” they cry in comment sections throughout the land, “What’s a Kim Kardashian?”. This performative I’m-too-busy-with-books-to-even-turn-on-the-TV intelligence usually backfires immediately (you’re telling me you’ve read 10,000 books but can’t discern that “Kimberly” is a woman’s name?)Pretending not to know who celebrities are to seem clever is likely an age-old phenomenon (Spartacus? Never heard of him) but thankfully, you no longer have to pretend. After makeup artist and YouTuber James Charles brought Birmingham to a standstill on Sunday – with traffic gridlocked as thousands of teenage fans flocked to see the 19-year-old at a shopping centre – many people are realising that they actually, genuinely haven’t the foggiest who 2019’s celebrities are.It’s now easier than ever to be out of the loop. Charles has almost 14m subscribers on his beauty-based YouTube channel, making him firmly famous by any measure. Yet the reaction to his Birmingham appearance has been everything from confused to outwardly hostile.“What a sad society we’ve turned into,” wrote one person in (where else but) a Facebook comment section, “Yes, people used to flock to get a glimpse of the Beatles, but the Beatles were writing amazing songs.” Another writes: “The world has definitely gone mad.” Sticking to the tried-and-tested theme, yet another adds: “You can’t compare it with the Beatles, different class.”Let’s give it a go, shall we? In 2014, CBS reported that the Beatles have sold 1.6bn singles in the United States since the 60s – in just three years, James Charles has accumulated 1.1bn views on his YouTube channel. The Beatles’ hair (which was unusually long for the time) was mocked by adults in the press who considered it androgynous Charles has been disparaged by the aforementioned internet commenters as a “boy in makeup”. Both are arguably revolutionary.“Aha!” you twist and shout. “But the Beatles were talented!” Charles undeniably has talent (get back to me when you can do a rainbow cut crease) but it’s equally undeniable that there are now huge swathes of “talentless” YouTube celebrities who do nothing but talk to the camera about imagined internet drama. So the world has definitely gone mad, yeah? THIS IS THE END? Sure, if you ignore thousands of years of human history in which talentless idiots were celebrated with power, pounds, and prestige (for research purposes, start with nearly every royal ever).Rather than getting angry at this new celebrity culture, we should accept it (at least in order to have the appropriate infrastructure in place for YouTubers’ public appearances). Of course, there’s no denying that it’s increasingly hard to keep up with our modern, silo-ed celebrities. Charles has more than 13 million subscribers, and so do Eleonora Maronese, Roi Fabito, Rachel Levin, Guillermo Díaz Ibañez, Wengie Huang, and Nathaniel Peterson. Who? There are now more celebrities than ever before. When Andy Warhol said we’d all have our 15 minutes of fame, I doubt he meant simultaneously.And there are real repercussions for a celebrity culture that takes place almost in secret – not least, how can parents hope to monitor who is influencing their kids if they’ve never even heard of the influencer in question? One of Britain’s most well-known YouTubers, Zoella, was first covered in a BBC article in 2013 which called her “one of the UK’s most successful young vloggers” – at the time she had 2.5m subscribers. There are now 3,208 YouTubers who have more than 2.5m subscribers.Things are changing so rapidly that it’s hard to keep up – but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t. A year after the mainstream press introduced people to Zoella, her debut novel broke records and became the fastest-selling book of 2014, before it emerged it was written by a ghostwriter. This scandal allowed parents to show children the truth about online stars who pretend to be their best friends – it was an important teachable moment. And yet, naturally, the  was disparaged by commenters at the time for writing “about a girl with a gloriously over-hyped book”.Snarky comments don’t help anyone, and we should recognise ignorance of celebrity culture as being just that – ignorance. I’m not saying you need to memorise all 3,208 YouTubers with over 2.5m subscribers – but when a person you’ve never heard of brings Britain’s second-largest city to a standstill, maybe Google them before scrolling to the comment section to type “WHO???”.• Amelia Tait is a journalist who writes about tech and internet phenomena"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f774f33d62f1ea80e7a5fb3a2a5695cf1eca4710/0_93_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d435f80c3f4ead5ed829cca9c8f6e68","title":"may brexit brady amendment","story":"British politics now follows the tortured pattern of addiction. Inside the addict’s head the most important thing is getting to the next Brexit fix, scoring the best deal. But from the outside, to our European friends and family, it is obvious that the problem is the compulsive pursuit of a product that does us only harm. On Tuesday night Theresa May thought she had scored: a slender majority in parliament voted for an imaginary agreement in Brussels, stripped of the hated “backstop”. Tory Eurosceptic ultras and the DUP pledged conditional allegiance to the prime minister if she delivers “alternative arrangements” for a seamless border on Northern Ireland. But no one has any idea what those might be and the EU has already ruled out a renegotiation on terms that might satisfy the hardliners. The transient buzz of Tory unity will yield to the chilly comedown of Brexit reality, as it always does.Some MPs can see the situation spiralling out of control. Today 298 lined up to demand an intervention. They backed a cross-party bid to seize control of the Brexit agenda from the government and delay the day of departure if necessary. But the move failed. There is ample horror of the no-deal scenario across the Commons (a vaguer condemnation of that option won a narrow majority), but clearly the greater fear is association with anything that looks like an active plot to thwart Brexit. Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, sponsors of the more controversial amendment, insisted their aim was only to guarantee an orderly departure, and there is no reason to doubt them. Parliament is packed with pro-Europeans who say no to the hard junk peddled by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg but are still hooked on softer strains of the leave drug.There is a booming trade in legal Brexit highs for MPs. The newest variant to hit the Westminster street is a confection put together by Kit Malthouse, a leave-voting Tory. His product has been endorsed by a remarkable spread of Conservative MPs, from former remainers to hardline Brexiteers. They grandiosely call it the “Malthouse compromise” – as if it were a magisterial vision for peace among nations and not a ragged stitch-up to postpone Tory civil war.The idea has two parts: first, renegotiate the backstop that promises a frictionless Northern Irish border second, if renegotiation fails, scrap the deal but salvage the transition period contained within in it. Then aim for an exit on WTO terms.It is a strange kind of compromise plan that offers no compromise. The backstop only exists because May’s Brexit red lines could not be bent around the Good Friday agreement any other way. As for the transition period, it is a condition of the current deal. The idea that it can be cut and pasted into some other deal presumes that the past two years have just been a warm-up before the real match starts. This new Malthouse doctrine is really the old hardline Brexit delusions in shinier shoes. It is the bluff that Britain holds all the cards, and that if we show enough contempt for treaties and economic logic, Brussels will be intimidated into granting favours that could not be won by conventional diplomacy.There are two possible reasons for pursuing that strategy. One is stupidity: failure to grasp what the negotiations so far have actually been about and how May’s deal was their logical outcome. The second is cynical vandalism: knowing that the plan will fail and hoping, when it does, to pin blame for a chaotic no-deal Brexit on Brussels intransigence. In truth it would be the fruition of Eurosceptic zealotry.It is sad to see self-styled Tory “moderates” taken in by such a con and alarming to hear May indulge it in the Commons as a “serious proposal”. Her next move is to Brussels, in a quest for something that two years of negotiation have already failed to uncover. But it seems the way to unite Tories these days is to expunge the period 2017 to 2018 from memory. May still acts as if Brexit is something that must be settled to the satisfaction of the Conservative party first, and only then shared with the rest of Europe. The British public is at the very back of the queue.Such obtuseness infuriates continental leaders more than the intent to quit their club. It was not a secret that Britain had a Eurosceptic political culture, even if the referendum result was shocking and upsetting. But what was also obvious in Brussels, Berlin and Paris was the gap between the idea of Brexit advertised by the leave campaign – the narcotic rush of words such as “freedom” and “sovereignty” – and the practical business of extricating Britain from EU structures. Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and others presumed this yawning chasm would be recognised by their British counterpart as a hazard. They expected May to start building bridges from the leavers’ fantasy island to the reality of what was available in negotiations with a bloc of 27 countries – the imbalance of power and the calculus of damage limitation.But May never confronted that logic. When she took the referendum result as her personal mission she also anointed herself with sacred oils of Brexiteer mythology. Her inscrutable demeanour and robotic speeches conceal a fervour that would be instantly identifiable as demagogy in a more expressive politician. At first, the prime minister’s rigid mask tricked Europeans into thinking she was a reasonable and capable person. It had a similar effect on the domestic audience. May’s bland style flattered a collective belief in the innate moderation of our politics. Her parochial mediocrity has nurtured the complacent assumption that the worst cannot happen here, that we are, at heart, a pragmatic nation not given to fanatical lurches. MPs imagine parliament as a political equivalent to the Greenwich meridian – the zero line from which other countries’ deviations are measured. We are slow to notice when the whole enterprise drifts wildly off course.Yet no one watching from the outside retains that romantic view of Britain as a bastion of political sobriety. They see instead a weird, stubborn refusal to talk about the crisis in plain English. MPs do battle over amendments to motions that change standing orders to permit bills to insist on extensions to a negotiating period, without saying what they think the outcome of that negotiation should be. Meanwhile, the prime minister invites her backbenchers to vote against something she has agreed in Brussels so she can go back and ask for something that she knows will be rejected.It is obvious that Brexit is a disaster, yet still so many MPs observe a taboo against saying that it should be stopped. To our continental friends and neighbours it is scarcely comprehensible. It looks like British social awkwardness elevated to the scale of a constitutional meltdown. It is the stiff upper lip chewing itself to pieces rather than name the cause of our suffering: not the deal, not the backstop, not the timetable, not Brussels, but Brexit. The poison in our system is Brexit. We need a path to recovery, not May’s frantic hunt for a stronger, purer dose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed5be6183a442ed57653e379cd110501ce33953a/0_129_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37d9187e80565b7f5068b794b7ceb80e","title":"nick clegg facebook unpopular","story":"The former deputy PM is used to taking the rap for unpopular policies. But the Facebook gig could be a poisoned chaliceOnce upon a time there was a Tumblr account called Nick Clegg Looking Sad, which consisted almost entirely of pictures of the then deputy prime minister looking miserable.It doesn’t seem to have been updated since the 2015 general election, presumably because that represented peak misery, but I was reminded of it on Tuesday when Clegg made his first outing as spin doctor for Facebook. He had been given some happy news to impart, including the creation of a centre for electoral integrity to try to fight political disinformation campaigns aimed at skewing elections. But the pained expression crept in when confronted on TV with examples of the kind of graphic Instagram posts that 14-year-old Molly Russell’s bereaved parents believe had a bearing on their daughter’s suicide, and asked whether he would want his own children to see them. There is something horribly familiar about the sight of Clegg publicly squirming over the consequences of things he doesn’t quite have the power to stop, as if the coalition years were happening all over again in slow motion.Former party leaders have to do something with the rest of their lives, obviously. Like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before him, Clegg is far too young to retire, and it seems he has said all he wants to say about Brexit. A corporate gig does at least beat making expensive speeches to bankers or offering private advice to foreign governments with murky human rights records. But the sight of a former deputy prime minister spinning for Mark Zuckerberg feels nonetheless symbolic of everything that is wrong with the relationship between big tech and politics. Clegg used to help run the country, and now Facebook seems to be running him. Is that really the way it’s meant to work?There has been a revolving door between Whitehall and Silicon Valley for many years now, with a steady stream of former special advisers being snapped up by the Googles and the Ubers and the Facebooks. It makes sense on one level – both politics and tech are bewilderingly fast-moving, complex environments with significant impact on ordinary lives and people who have worked in one are perhaps unusually suited to working in the other – but it also illustrates the problem. The single biggest threat to the seemingly unstoppable rise of the tech oligarchs would be a government with teeth, prepared either to regulate platforms more strictly or to tax them more heavily. These companies, like any company, will naturally seek to anticipate and where possible frustrate any political threat to their business model. The obvious way of doing that is hiring people with understanding of, and preferably influence over, the political process.But the Facebook empire (which also includes Whatsapp and Instagram among other platforms) now has a broader reputational problem, too. Even if it could square off the politicians, its own users don’t like what they are hearing about everything from invasions of their personal privacy to the toxification of public debate and the role of social media in fuelling the rise of far-right movements. By hiring a politician rather than an anonymous former special adviser, Facebook seems to be trying to engage directly with the public.It’s a risk for both sides. Politicians are used to articulating their own views, not parroting other people’s, and it may take Clegg a while to get used to answering questions about the limits of regulation in Zuckerberg’s voice rather than his own. But the bigger reputational risk is perhaps to Clegg personally, and, by association, the Liberal Democrats in general, whose members care more than most about questions of privacy, freedom of speech and civil liberties.He has presumably gone in believing that Facebook really does want to be a force for good now that it’s better to be in the room when the decisions are taken than outside railing hopelessly against them, and that whatever concessions he can extract are worth the awkward compromises that will sometimes need to be made. And yes, all that may sound a bit familiar to Liberal Democrats who lived through the coalition years.

Another evening of parliamentary pantomime after which nothing of substance has been achieved. But what pantomime! We’ve seen the prime minister join her party in demanding changes to the deal negotiated by – the prime minister. She backed an amendment that unpicked a deal she negotiated, thereby instructing herself to go back and try harder. Meanwhile, Labour demanded – and failed to get – a delay, without really knowing what it was for. But the bottom line is clear. Sixty days to go until we are scheduled to leave the European Union. And we still don’t know what we want.So what happened this evening? First, parliament proudly displayed its inability to decide. They decided, via the Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey amendment, that they don’t want no deal – though only in a non-binding manner. Heaven forbid options get definitively taken off the table. Second, they supported an amendment calling for changes to the infamous Northern Ireland backstop.Several things stand out from all this. First, Tory tribalism. The tantalising prospect of reforging party unity saw remainer Nicky Morgan making common cause with Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg. It must have felt great. The problem is that it is a consensus built on … cake. The Graham Brady amendment called for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. The assumption is, presumably, that the EU, confronted with a stirring demonstration of parliamentary unity (well, a 317-301 majority anyway) will cave in.This seems unlikely at best. It is of course possible that, in extremis, the EU would reopen the withdrawal agreement. But there seems little reason to believe the member states would countenance the amendment, still less removal, of the backstop. Clarifications or interpretations, yes. But not of a kind to change its meaning or the implications of what has already been agreed.Meanwhile others, particularly on the Labour benches, hunt their own fantasy beasts – or, worse, simply misunderstand what is going on. The front bench continues to claim it would negotiate a better deal than the one secured by May. The idea of a customs union with the UK having a say on EU trade deals is a personal favourite. Assorted backbenchers, meanwhile, justify their opposition to her deal in terms of their desire for things – a customs union most noticeably – that are completely consistent with that deal.And so we have it. The natural party of government voting for unicorns. The party in opposition not quite sure what it wants.And who emerged the happiest from this evening’s proceedings? The proceedings were grist to the mill of that – tiny – band of MPs who hanker after a no-deal outcome. For the European Research Group, the Brady amendment was a “win-win”. Not only does the clock tick further down to 29 March while the prime minister tries to negotiate something the EU won’t accept. But the outline of a narrative of EU intransigence has come into sharper focus. “There was something we could agree to, but Brussels wouldn’t listen.”So where does all this leave us? Temporally closer to no deal. Even if it’s an outcome that parliament has rejected, the fact of being one day closer to 29 March means it is more likely to come about by mistake.Apart from that, we wait. Wait for May to go back to Brussels and seek to achieve in under a fortnight what she failed to achieve in a year of negotiations. And wait for 13 February – when, it seems, parliament will again get a chance to figure out what it actually wants. Now the prime minister has punched a backstop-shaped hole through her deal, there’s less reason than ever to think that MPs will settle on this.• Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe, and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.

She came back from the greatest parliamentary loss by a government to secure, miraculously, a majority to refresh her wilted withdrawal agreement. Mrs May has had to vote against her own defeated deal to do so. She has had to offer MPs another chance to judge her government in a fortnight’s time. She has had to offer assurances that workers’ rights would be respected and that going forward she would take MPs of all opinions into her confidence. These are undoubtedly moves in the right direction.However, it is difficult to see how the prime minister will deliver on her parliamentary success. Much more likely, her victory will turn out to be a pyrrhic one. Mrs May put party before country to be on the winning side of the parliamentary vote. She did so by hitching a lift on a Brexiter flight of fantasy, telling MPs she can achieve a “significant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement” which would provide “alternative arrangements” to the Irish backstop. The danger is that Mrs May has raised expectations that cannot be met.This may be part of the theatre of this negotiation. Mrs May wanted to remain prime minster and she has revised her deal lightly to get it passed, even if that meant giving up on the facts. Her logical contortions highlight her desire to prevent at all costs a split within her party and a Corbyn-led government. The ultimate source of political authority is parliament. Although MPs resiled from taking control of the Brexit process on Tuesday, parliamentarians did defeat the government to express a strong desire not to leave the EU without a deal. This gave cover to Jeremy Corbyn to meet with Mrs May to discuss Labour’s concerns. While little may come of such a meeting, it is a small step forward for some kind of parliamentary consensus. The problem has always been that it is clear what a Commons majority is against, but not what it is for.Mrs May will have her work cut out to wrangle a new deal in Brussels. How she does so when barely a month of parliamentary time is left before 29 March is yet to be explained. Another PM, a French one in the form of Pierre Mendès France, wisely said: “To govern is to choose, however difficult the choices.” Mrs May has not made a choice. Instead she opted to seemingly entertain the delusions of hard Brexiters. She is pursuing a fiction that ignores trade-offs. She has used her defeat as an opportunity to deepen the colour of her red lines, endorsing a deal the EU27 is unlikely to accept. This is not governing.Mrs May’s achievement represents a defeat for sensible thinking. The victory she snatched from the jaws of defeat is a dismal one: reducing Britain’s role in the world and weakening links to our largest trading partner. It is also appears undeliverable. Mrs May has taken this route after a more conventional approach for seeking consensus within her party failed. Instead the concern will be that she is forced into adopting the hard Brexit playbook, characterised by a relentlessness and lack of concern for anything but claiming victory. In backing the Brady amendment Mrs May has made a commitment she cannot easily keep. If it unravels, she will be tempted to blame the other party with a fantastical line of reasoning, leaving Britain listing alone in unfriendly waters. MPs must ensure that does not happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a297af75378d60a4c98a5c0c389e29a8ed7e8775/0_0_941_571/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6ebc8a885780ca9a975e8b2804c7ad 700w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sweet","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sweet’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sweet’.Share your photos of what sweet means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 30 January at 10am.

To make matters worse, festival goers had no means of getting home.In the fallout, festival organiser Billy McFarland pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges relating to the festival and in July pleaded guilty to various fraud charges stemming from a separate ticket selling operation, and sentenced to six years in federal prison.A separate civil lawsuit naming McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, brought by festival goers Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello claims the two men “knowingly lured attendees with false and fraudulent pretenses, in which the festival could not compare to”.They claim the event bore no resemblance to the event conjured up by Fyre’s “glossy” marketing and was instead an “unplanned, unorganized, disaster-stricken area” that organizers continued promoting until the day some of the 7,000 expected attendees began to arrive on the island.But any efforts to reclaim money from the women who signed on to promote the event may be hard-won. Despite a crackdown in 2017 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that warned celebrities and influencers must be clear about when their posts have been paid for, they cannot be held responsible for the product or event itself.The Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman released a statement saying investors and customers lost about $26m in the scam.At the hearing this week, Gregory Messer, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of Fyre Media, said the task of unpicking exactly what had gone wrong had been “challenging” considering the lack of basic disclosures, bankruptcy schedules and a statement of financial affairs from the organisers.According to Women’s Wear Daily, payments totaling more than $5.2m were paid out to multiple recipients, including $1.2m to IMG models and $275,000 to Jenner.Of the 24 people in question, Fyre Media paid each one no less than $90,000. Messer said the recipients are needed for questioning “to gain a full understanding of the reasons for these transfers”.But while the supermodels were warned away from the event as it began to collapse, some were quick to apologise – and to establish that they had nothing to do with the failure.Bella Hadid shared on Twitter, “even though this was not my project what so ever” she “initially trusted this would be an amazing \u0026amp memorable experience for all of us”.She continued she was “not knowing about the disaster that was to come…I feel so sorry and badly because this is something I couldn’t stand by, although of course if I would have known about the outcome, you would have all known too. I hope everyone is safe and back with their families and loved ones…xo.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Here is a breakdown of what happened – and what it means for your autumn wardrobeby  Helen Seamons,  Morwenna Ferrier and  Matt FidlerThe autumnwinter 2019 menswear shows were full of comebacks and firsts. Milan hosted blockbuster shows from Prada, Versace and even Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, treading carefully after last year’s China racism row. Paris was packed and cold, but saw universally successful debuts from Hedi Slimane at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy. Craig Green returned to the London schedule alongside Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who had a plaid party in a warehouse, and A-Cold-Wall*, which put a doberman on the catwalk. Scarves were long, bags were big and for the first time in four seasons, tailoring triumphed over tracksuits. Here are the other trends we can expect to see next autumn.Rare is the season in which leopard print is absent from womenswear … but menswear? It’s hardly a perennial. Yet this season it was, appearing in all shades and motifs, brash and textured. At John Lawrence Sullivan, it appeared on coats and bomber jackets in clear 70s prints. At Marni, it ran the gamut – from creepers and fluffy coats, to hats and wide-legged trousers, lending the whole collection a cartoonish edge. Neil Barrett put it on collars and Sacai doubled it up, but few expected to see a mod-style leopard-print coat in a quiet shade of gold. Some labels can change their spots, it seems.This season, the death knell rang out for sportswear. Well, not quite, but the suit gave it a run for its money. Black versions that were edgy and funereal at the same time led the charge. In Paris, they were elegant, crisp and flowing at Dries van Noten, relaxed and casual at Valentino, and serious and winter-proof at Dunhill. At Dior, they came red-carpet ready with a detachable sash.Over in Milan, Prada and Fendi showed versions with a high-octane glamour and feminine undertone – think shine and a slim cut that was pleasing to watch on the catwalk. Stella McCartney went for a back-to-school version. At Berluti, Kris Van Assche closed the show with a his-and-hers version – because how many trends overlap genders quite so keenly?The autumn catwalks were a riot of colour this season, yet one shade ruled them all. Surprisingly, for a world that has been saturated by millennial pink and all the cultural and gender baggage that comes with it, here it was used with nuance, clashing with green or layered up at Ami and Acne Studios (the same Acne Studios that put it on a bag and launched a thousand copycats). At Loewe, Anderson turned it into a suit over comically oversized shirting, a fun combination which clashed magically with the mustard carpet.Craig Green and Marni went for head to toe, playing with textures and fabrics – high shine or knitted, this was a “choose your weapon” moment. At Raf Simons, in his first show since news of his departure from Calvin Klein, the takeaway moment was a voluminous pink trenchcoat – no belt – styled in a loose, carefree way. “I want to do something abstract and beautiful and elegant and proud and sophisticated, but without losing the edge of what the brand stands for: the young generation,” he told Vogue. Touche.As ever, leather was a recurring theme at the shows this year, though few things will top the Instagram picture of Frank Ocean in a pair of leather Loewe chaps backstage. That said, Isabel Marant’s flying jackets with billowing arms were wearable and a tour de force, while Givenchy’s ultra-tight leather trench (belted, this time) was a lesson in elegance. Jil Sander’s loose-fitting, grey leather shirt and leather trouser combination was aimed at the brave. Ditto Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who went vintage with his jackets, and Berluti which opened the show at the Palais Garnier opera house with a tan brushed leather suit.This season, men’s fashion continues to work in tandem with the weather, with puffer jackets designed to withstand the polar vortex. A bona fide trend since Balenciaga put them on the 2017 catwalk, they came athleisure-friendly at Iceberg under James Long in London, patched like a Mondrian at Fendi in Milan or low-denier and commuter-friendly at British label, Cottweiler.If oversized, primary-coloured puffer jackets have dominated high and low fashion for the past two years, Rick Owens’ longline versions were a u-turn moment, coming fitted in metallic and monochrome shades. Marni’s Francesco Risso introduced the hybrid coatrobe as outerwear this season, but it was his layered puffers in iced lemon which stole the show. Unless you count Cardi B’s onoff boyfriend, Offset, modelling a duvet coat in lilac with a built-in bumbag worn cross-body on the Off White catwalk, accessorised by the scent of vaping.Bags’ shapes wax and wane in fashion. But in menswear this season, they were enormous. In Paris, Hermès showed a men’s version of its cult Birkin bag in deep red, but elsewhere they tended towards sportier shapes. At Louis Vuitton, designer Virgil Abloh created a giant rucksack in grey felt with a subtle monogram, while Loewe created a drawstring bag in pastel leather. Working with a “survivalist” theme, Korean designer Juun.J created silver foil totes which packed down small – this in stark contrast to Xander Zhou whose huge one shouldered bags resembled angel’s wings.Designers took their cue from Mr Tickle this season with scarves of all textures, shapes and colours trailing down the catwalks. At Acne Studios and Valentino they were floor-length and comically proportioned, either tasselled or fine ribbed and thrown over one shoulder. At Sunnei in Milan they came in muted tones with an apres-piste aesthetic, and were as wide as blankets. Dunhill designer Mark Weston continued to play with the classically masculine wardrobe his were short, in a puffer fabric. Sport meets tailoring, perhaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

It proved to be an unavoidable and unfortunate reminder of The Report, Scott Z Burns’s thrilling, similarly themed and similarly talky political drama that premiered just days earlier. While that film, about an investigation into the CIA’s post-911 torture practices, avoided cliche and construct, the Eye in the Sky director Gavin Hood has delivered a far more traditional and at times stuffy tale, one that might be more suited to the small screen.Hood’s major ace is Keira Knightley, whose rousing lead performance adds a much-needed fire, igniting the pedestrian-level drama around her. She’s playing Katharine Gun, a translator working at Government Communications Headquarters who finds herself frustrated with what she’s seeing on the news. It’s 2003 and as Tony Blair argues for British involvement in an Iraq war, she’s struggling to understand the reasoning, aware of the lack of evidence underpinning his case. When Katharine receives an email asking for help, she’s concerned. Aware that a UN resolution was looking unlikely, the NSA was asking GCHQ employees to spy on diplomats, hoping to blackmail them into agreeing that invasion was necessary. Unsettled and angered by the request, Katharine found herself tasked with a life-changing dilemma, forced to weigh up the importance of herself versus her country.The story of Katharine Gun is one that’s often been overlooked and undervalued since the Iraq war and there’s immense satisfaction in seeing her bravery and selflessness heralded on the big screen. Hood, a South African director who’s experienced a patchy career in Hollywood after breaking out with the Oscar-winning Tsotsi, sticks to a similar formula used in his last film Eye in the Sky, which saw a troupe of talented actors discuss the morality of war as it pertained to a specific situation. While that film gripped, this one often plods, the story feeling a bit stretched over the expansive two-hour running time.After the email is leaked, Hood follows its arrival at the Observer and while it’s fascinating to witness the internal debate that took place over both its veracity and how it might affect the paper’s pro-invasion stance at the time, the newsroom scenes border on ham. While Matt Smith and Matthew Goode are solid, too many other performances feel broad and overcooked, especially Conleth Hill as editor Roger Alton and Rhys Ifans as Ed Vulliamy, who almost manages to outdo his turn in Snowden for sheer awfulness. These scenes are intermixed with Katharine’s domestic life and the strain the decision took on her marriage and while they do help build to a particularly tense sequence involving a potential deportation, the majority of them feel flat and repetitive and as her husband, Adam Bakri is utterly wooden.But the film relies on its lead star and Knightley is more than equipped for the task of carrying it on her shoulders. For too long, she was trapped in a cycle of mostly thankless supporting roles, from London Boulevard to Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit to Everest to Collateral Beauty, but after her commanding, nuanced lead performance in Colette, it feels like she’s having something of a comeback. She’s fantastic here, vulnerable and strong-willed, her face conveying the inner anguish of someone losing faith in her government while fearful for what might come next. During one particular interrogation, she’s particularly electric but in this scene, as with many others, she’s fighting against mediocrity both in the performers she’s paired with and Hood’s flat direction.

It was always on the table at home and all the ingredients were either grown in the allotment or greenhouse, or bought from the local greengrocer. The dressing was salad cream – never vinaigrette or mayonnaise. This is my version.Serves 4raw beetroot 4 malt vinegar 100ml eggs 4 large, at room temperaturecucumber 1 full-flavoured salad tomatoes 6 spring onions 1 bunch, trimmed and slicedradishes 1 bunch (or 2 bunches if they are small), halvedbutton mushrooms 6, finely slicedmustard and cress 1 punnet, freshly cutsea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the salad creamegg yolks 2 English mustard 2 tsp caster sugar 2 tsp lemon juice 2 tbsp light olive oil 100ml double cream 150mlTo make the salad cream, put the egg yolks, mustard, sugar and lemon juice into a bowl and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually add the olive oil, drop by drop to begin with and then in a steady stream until it is all incorporated. Slowly whisk in the cream and season with salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate until required.To cook the beetroot, put them into a pan with the malt vinegar, cover with water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 25-30 minutes until tender.In the meantime, bring a pan of water to the boil. Gently lower in the eggs and cook for 6 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pan and refresh in ice-cold water. Leave until cold, then peel away the shells.Once the beetroot are cooked, remove them from the pan and leave until cool enough to handle, then peel away the skin.Peel and slice the cucumber and place in a large bowl. Cut out the stalk end from the tomatoes and slice each one into 8 wedges. Add to the bowl along with the spring onions, radishes and mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently to mix.Scatter the salad veg over a large serving platter. Cut the boiled eggs in half lengthways and arrange across the salad. Slice the beetroot and lay the slices on the salad. Add drizzles of salad cream and scatter over the mustard and cress. Serve the rest of the dressing separately for everyone to help themselves.From Nathan Outlaw’s Home Kitchen by Nathan Outlaw (Quadrille, £20) While living in Changsha I was lucky enough to meet one of the really great chefs of the older generation, Shi Yinxiang, then in his late 80s and still overseeing a restaurant bearing his name in the centre of town. Master Shi was born in 1917, the third generation of chefs in his family. He told me he had begun cooking at home at the age of 10, and five years later had started his apprenticeship under a famous chef who had worked in the household of a government official before opening his own restaurant in Changsha. There he learned the subtle arts of Hunanese haute cuisine, and by the 1950s he was working for the government, and in charge of the catering for the visits of national leaders, including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Jiang Zemin. Shi became known for his brilliant and innovative cooking, and in the 1980s he published a comprehensive Hunanese cookery book that brought together his more than 50 years’ experience. He is an enchanting man, with a kindly manner and a face that creases up frequently into a beatific smile. He is still riding on a crest of glory as the man who managed to delight Chairman Mao with his cooking, and the first Hunanese chef to be awarded “special first-grade” status.The following recipe is a humble one, but it’s a soup that I ate at Master Shi’s restaurant as he told me about his life. The dried seaweed, which is sold in thin discs about 20cm in diameter, and looks black and frizzy before soaking, can be found in good Chinese supermarkets.Serves 2 as Western style starter, 4 as part of Chinese meal vegetarian stock 1 litre dried purple laver seaweed 1 disc (nori in Japanese)fresh ginger 20g, peeled and slivered salt and white pepperegg 1spring onion 1, green part only, finely slicedHeat the stock with the seaweed and ginger and simmer gently as the seaweed reconstitutes itself. Tease the tightly massed disc apart with a pair of chopsticks, so the seaweed drifts in strands in the liquid. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Beat the egg well. Turn the heat down to a minimum, drizzle in the egg into the soup in a thin spiralling stream across the surface. Then turn off the heat, cover the pan tightly and leave for a minute to allow the egg to set into little flakes or “flowers”.Serve immediately with a sprinkling of spring onion.From The Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook by Fuchsia Dunlop (Ebury Press, £30)Eggs are the fall-back ingredient in every Indian household. I associate egg curry with monsoons in Calcutta, when the bazaar was closed due to flooding. The local delivery man would bring eggs to our home, cycling through the flooded streets. The egg curry made at home usually included potatoes to make the dish more substantial, though I have omitted them here. You can use any type of egg for this dish, even quail eggs. In India we leave the eggs whole, but you can halve them before returning them to the pan. Just be careful not to lose their yolks in the gravy.Serves 2medium eggs 4 vegetable oil 6 tbsp green cardamom pod 1 clove 1 Indian bay leaf 1 cumin seeds ½ tsp onions 2 medium, finely choppedgarlic paste 1 tsp fresh ginger paste 1 tbsp ground turmeric ½ tsp ground coriander 1 tbsp chilli powder ½ tsp natural (plain) yogurt 6 tbsp salt 1 tsp fresh herbs a handful, to garnishIf you keep your eggs in the refrigerator, take them out 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. Fill a large pan with water and bring to a rolling boil over a high heat. Lower the heat to a simmer, then place the eggs in the water and cook for 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the pan and place in cold running water to prevent further cooking. When they’re cool enough to handle, shell the eggs.In a shallow saucepan, heat the oil over a medium-high heat. Add the hard-boiled eggs and cook until they are speckled all over with brown patches. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.To the remaining oil, add the cardamom, clove and bay leaf. Add the cumin seeds and cook, stirring, for a few seconds until the seeds darken.Add the chopped onions, garlic and ginger to the pan, cook for a further 5 minutes until the onion mixture has softened and coloured to a light brown. Continue to stir while cooking to prevent the onions from burning and sticking to the base of the pan. If the onion mixture does stick to the base of the pan, sprinkle over some water.Add the ground turmeric, coriander and chilli powder. Cook, stirring, for 10-20 seconds or until the “raw” smell of the turmeric has disappeared, taking care not to let the ground spices burn. Pour over 200ml cold water and increase the heat to high.Once any excess water has evaporated, lower the heat. To avoid any lumps in the sauce, stir the yogurt before adding it to the pan. Stir to mix evenly and then season with salt. Lastly, add the hard boiled eggs to the pan and allow to heat through. Before serving, scatter over plenty of fresh herbs.From Asma’s Indian Kitchen by Asma Khan (Pavilion Books, £20)Toasted, flaked almonds add a welcome note of crispness to the base of a cheesecake and lighten the crust. My feeling is that the base should be delicate and barely there, so I avoid pressing the crumbs into the cake tin too firmly, as it tends to compact the mixture.Serves 8For the crustflaked almonds 70gplain biscuits 150g, such as Nice or Mariebutter 65gFor the mousseeggs 4 mediumcaster sugar 150glemons 2 largegelatine 5 sheets (9g)full-fat cream cheese 250gdouble cream 250mlrose petals a handfulYou will need a round 20-22cm cake tin with a removable base, lined on the base with a disc of baking parchment.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the flaked almonds until golden, then remove from the heat. Crush the biscuits to fine crumbs, either in a plastic freezer bag with a rolling pin, or using a food processor.Melt the butter, then add the crumbs and flaked almonds, and mix thoroughly. Transfer the mixture to the lined cake tin, pressing it in a thin layer over the base. Chill for an hour.Separate the eggs. Put the whites in a large mixing bowl. Beat the yolks and sugar together using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment until thick and pale. Grate the lemons finely, then add the zest to the yolk mix.Juice the lemons – you will need 125ml. Soak the gelatine in a bowl of cool water. Warm the lemon juice in a small saucepan and remove from the heat. Lift the softened gelatine from the water (it should be a soft, quivery mass, only just solid enough to pick up) and drop it into the warm juice. Stir until it is dissolved.Add the cream cheese to the yolk-and-sugar mixture, beating until completely smooth, then add the lemon juice and gelatine. Whip the cream until it’s thick enough to sit in soft waves (not quite thick enough to stand in stiff peaks), then fold gently into the mixture. Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them in carefully and thoroughly.Pour the mixture into the chilled cake tin (it should come almost to the top), then cover tightly with clingfilm and chill overnight. (Make sure you don’t have anything garlicky in the fridge – mousse-type dishes will pick up the scent overnight.)The next day, run a warm palette knife around the edge of the cake to release it from the edges, then remove it carefully from the tin. Decorate with the rose petals.Note that the cake is wobbly and fragile, so keep it chilled until you intend to serve it, and use a cake slice to serve it.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s food writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d15a87fa62b70ead2d812d235f5e2643274a27/137_0_5038_3023/master/5038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb895cc20400029a10d008a89dbe5ce","title":"arsenal cardiff city premier league match report","story":"It was a night of conflicting emotions for Cardiff. Neil Warnock had admitted that “in an ideal world” his club would not have played. There have been a lot of painful questions since the disappearance last Monday of Emiliano Sala – Cardiff’s record signing from Nantes – and one of them has taken in the point of it all.How can a bunch of blokes kick a ball around with any meaning when one of their own is missing presumed dead? On the other hand, Warnock knew a game was perhaps what Cardiff needed – to get them firing again to work up some adrenaline against all of the misery.Warnock saw his team play well, carrying the fight to Arsenal, especially during a first half that they controlled. He described it as Cardiff’s best away performance of the season and he could be pleased, even surprised, to see his players rack up 19 shots, albeit only two were on target.There was frustration when Bruno Ecuele Manga stretched into an ill-advised challenge to concede a 66th-minute penalty, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted to turn the game. Warnock called it “diabolical”.Alexandre Lacazette scored Arsenal’s second as Unai Emery’s team closed up on fourth-placed Chelsea, and the substitute Nathaniel Mendez-Laing’s stoppage-time drag back and finish was nothing more than a consolation. Yet the truth was that the football was a sideshow. Sala was in the hearts and minds of everyone and Warnock spoke with feeling afterwards.On the upside, Warnock admitted it had done him and his players the power of good to get back out there. “The first five minutes, to shout at the fourth official was fantastic,” he said, with a smile.Yet once again Warnock did not disguise the depth of the trauma. “I can’t explain how it’s been this week but you’ve not wanted to get out of bed,” he said. “Everything was really miserable and nobody could actually do anything about it. I know we’ve lost a game of football but there are other more important things.“What’s gone on has been unprecedented. We spoke about it before kick-off – that we ought to, for Emiliano, try to put in a performance. I know people would expect us to lay down but I thought they showed what they were made of tonight.”The travelling supporters held up yellow placards when the teams emerged for the kick-off, while the captains, Mesut Özil and Sol Bamba, strode to the centre circle to lay wreaths. There was one bouquet of yellow tulips – the symbol of Nantes – and another of yellow daffodils to represent Wales. It was also a nice touch from the programme editors to include Sala’s name at the bottom of the squad lists on the back cover – hauntingly, without a shirt number.There were banners in the away end. “Once a bluebird, always a bluebird,” read one. Another said: “We never saw you play, we never saw you score but Emiliano, our beautiful bluebird, we will love you forever.” What was meant to be a minute of pre-match silence turned into a period of applause.Life goes on football goes on. But how to focus? Cardiff showed their professionalism and they ought to have led at the interval. Bobby Reid blew two clear chances while Oumar Niasse was denied a penalty when Nacho Monreal nibbled at him inside the area.Ecuele Manga made two rash penalty-box challenges on Lacazette in the first half and the Arsenal fans howled when Mike Dean refused to penalise him. Lacazette did not make a meal out of the first and, perhaps, he made too much of the second.Dean had no option but to point to the spot when Ecuele Manga erred again, lungingin on Sead Kolasinac, who had been released by the half-time substitute, Alex Iwobi. Aubameyang’s goal was his 18th of the season in all competitions.Arsenal had offered little in the first half, bar an early Lacazette shot which was blocked by Ecuele Manga and a Shkodran Mustafi header that flashed wide. But they were better after the break, when Iwobi and a switch to 4-2-3-1 brought more urgency.Iwobi was denied by Neil Etheridge before Lacazette scored when he outstripped Bamba and shot into the bottom corner. It might have been different had Mustafi not made a saving challenge on Niasse in the 65th minute. The story of the match, though, was of a club attempting to work through its grief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7ffb40e4ee784d8ce930dad11336e74d748b45/110_134_3395_2037/master/3395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde8fdc3dd1350a9baccb79d5f82eb27","title":"manchester united burnley premier league match report","story":"Manchester United’s winning run under Ole Gunnar Solskjær ended after nine matches but Victor Lindelöf’s late equaliser keeps them unbeaten under the caretaker manager and was the kind of comeback made famous by the 20-times champions.Chris Wood’s 81st-minute header looked to have proved the winner despite Paul Pogba’s late penalty but after bombarding Burnley’s goal up stepped Lindelöf to smash home in added time to send the home support delirious.It left Solskjaer contented with the spirit but rueing two points that escaped. “The way they came back was fantastic,” he said. “So I’m happy with a point but we could have got three at the end. Now you’ve got your answer – can they come back if they go one down or two down even, so I’m very happy with the response.”He made five changes from Friday’s FA Cup win at Arsenal. He retained Romelu Lukaku and introduced Marcus Rashford, the first time they operated together under the Norwegian. Alexis Sánchez was dropped after scoring, Jesse Lingard joining him on the bench, with no place for Anthony Martial due to a minor injury.The other four new selections were Juan Mata, David De Gea, Phil Jones and Andreas Pereira, who replaced Ander Herrera, the midfielder also a substitute.After Burnley’s 5-0 walloping at Manchester City in the Cup on Saturday, Sean Dyche reverted to the XI that drew at Watford in their last league outing.In selecting Pereira and Lukaku Solskjaer took what appeared a gamble. He stood down Herrera from what had been his first-choice side and moved Rashford from the No 9 berth out left to accommodate Lukaku.The early signs augured well regarding Rashford. First, he combined sharply with Mata and Pogba and stood up a cross from his wing that Burnley scrambled out for a corner. Then, he was in the area to have a shot blocked. Next came a one-two with Lukaku, though when in on goal he stabbed wide when scoring looked easier.Pereira’s first contribution was to spray a wild ball and concede possession and from this juncture Burnley enjoyed a passage of pressure inside United’s half.They went close after Wood found Ashley Westwood and Jones’s intervention nearly became a pass to Ashley Barnes as Luke Shaw slipped but the central defender cleaned up.What Burnley did well was press United inside their half. Pereira often had to go backwards when receiving due to the close attention of a white shirt. The way to beat this can be quick ball forward as when Lukaku took possession and flipped in a delivery towards Rashford in Burnley’s area.As soon as the second half started there was a scare for United. When De Gea tried to prevent a corner he handed possession to Barnes but to the goalkeeper’s relief it pin-balled back to him.The home side’s response was to move up-field, a sequence that ended with Mata hitting straight at Tom Heaton. More fluidity followed when Young pinged a 40-yard diagonal pass to Shaw along the left. He killed the ball, found Pogba and the effort had to be watched closely by the keeper.Then disaster struck for United and it was down to Pereira. The midfielder he dawdled near his own D and Jack Cork pounced and dispossessed him. From there, the ball was left to Barnes and he smashed home.This left Pereira aghast and United behind for the first time under Solskjær. Here, then, was a new test for him: could his side keep calm and respond?When Young forced a corner United had a chance. His delivery found Shaw and his attempt flashed across goal only for Pogba’s back-heel to be steered wide.Just after the hour mark Solskjær acted. This was the obvious move of pulling off the disappointing – and disappointed – Pereira and bringing on Lingard. United turned the heat up and after Lukaku’s close-range effort was saved he was replaced by Sánchez. This moved Rashford back inside but the question of why Solskjær had tinkered in the first place remained.He said: “Rom’s done really well against Burnley before, he’s scored, he’s a handful and with Anthony injured we thought that was the best option with Rashy out there.”Dyche was unhappy with Lingard’s part in the penalty, going down following a Jeff Hendrick challenge. “I just don’t like it when there’s a touch on the shoulder and their legs don’t work but it’s modern football,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e960ce73e2533b96397a45477598d62b5794ac9a/67_281_2461_1476/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cba0f7399b3f88556b656b7938ba5cf","title":"newcastle united manchester city premier league match report","story":"Rafael Benítez succeeded in pulling off the rare feat of making two sets of supporters extremely happy.Not content with choreographing a win which eases his side’s relegation worries, Newcastle’s manager significantly enhanced the chances of the former club still closest to his heart beating Manchester City to the title.Should Liverpool defeat Leicester at Anfield on Wednesday night they will go seven points clear of Pep Guardiola’s team, who may have kicked off with a swagger in their step but departed Tyneside staring at the floor.Few would have guessed the final score correctly after 24 seconds. Raheem Sterling has been setting agendas on and off the pitch of late and, straight from the kick-off, he was at it again, advancing down the right before sending a deep cross looping towards the far post.With Benítez’s back five looking merely half awake, Martin Dubravka was left unprotected and came off his line. His advance failed to prevent David Silva challenging – rather bravely or, perhaps, foolishly – for a header and, almost inevitably, the pair collided leaving Newcastle’s goalkeeper to miss the ball completely. Unluckily for Dubravka it fell for Sergio Agüero to lash into the empty net from around six yards.City had scored their 29th goal in seven games and as a familiar refrain rose from the Gallowgate End it felt a case of plus ça change. “We want Mike Ashley out,” demanded home fans. “We want Ashley out.”Not for the first time, the anger directed towards Newcastle’s owner offered confirmation that political tensions are not confined to Westminster. More than 280 miles north a febrile civil war has been raging between Benítez and Ashley.By hinting that no signings by 11pm might prompt him to walk out, Benítez forced the sports retail tycoon into a corner and Ashley finally extended an olive branch. Where transfer activity had been dormant, St James’ Park suddenly turned into a hive of activity with the Paraguay attacking midfielder Miguel Almirón on the verge of becoming a record signing and the Greece defensive midfielder Andreas Samaris and the Italian full-back Antonio Barreca discussing loan moves.Only time will tell if such recruits might mollify Benítez sufficiently to persuade him to extend his contract beyond May but the immediate future at least seems a little more certain.Unstable to start with, Newcastle’s defence acquired sturdiness as the game unravelled. Even so, they were fortunate not to fall further behind when Matt Ritchie conceded a free-kick following a foul on Sterling. That dead ball was whipped in brilliantly, and swiftly, by Kevin De Bruyne before Agüero redirected it into the roof of the net. The only problem was De Bruyne had not waited for the whistle and the “goal” was disallowed.Far from impressed, City clearly felt this represented painful pedantry on the part of referee, Paul Tierney, with their dismay only intensifying when De Bruyne was booked for his quick thinking.Conscious they had been reprieved, Newcastle regrouped and even gave their guests an odd counterattacking fright, most notably when Christian Atsu’s 20-yard shot took a hefty deflection off John Stones and swerved marginally off target.By now the temperature was plunging and a thin frost seemed to have permeating City’s brains, inhibiting customary invention and incision. At times, Guardiola’s players looked distinctly mortal.Yet although Dubravka was surprisingly underemployed, City remained loosely in control and Newcastle’s Fabian Schär made two vital interceptions namely a splendidly timed tackle that prevented the lively Agüero from scoring and then a clearance off the line which erted David Silva’s header to safety after City’s captain had displayed a wonderful change of pace before playing a one-two with Danilo.Schär’s interventions had the added effect of ensuring Guardiola could not relax. City’s manager looked perpetually on edge whenever Atsu’s counterattacking pace highlighted his side’s defensive vulnerabilities.Actually exploiting them was something entirely different though. If Almirón had been on the pitch in the No 10 role it might have been different but, in his absence, improvisation was hardly an injury-hit Newcastle’s strong suit. Neither were killer final balls.Benítez’s players did possess plenty of sheer bloody-minded determination and it paid idends when Fernandinho only partially cleared a Ritchie cross and Isaac Hayden headed it back into the box. City had made the mistake of leaving Salomón Rondón unmarked and, having narrowly avoided colliding with Atsu, he drove a right-foot shot into the turf which bounced up over a nonplussed Ederson and on towards the roof of the net. Guardiola and co appealed for offside but their pleas seemed forlorn.Tellingly that equaliser came very shortly after De Bruyne had been diplomatically withdrawn in the wake of a challenge on Ritchie arguably worthy of a second yellow card.No one epitomises Newcastle’s diligence more than Benítez’s right-winger turned left wing-back so it seemed fitting Ritchie scored the winner from the penalty spot following Fernandinho’s foul on Sean Longstaff – and what seemed an eternity of a delay while Ederson had treatment on a groin injury which may, or may not, have been a psychological ploy designed to preserve his side’s title hopes.If so, it failed, leaving the ball firmly in Liverpool’s court."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6bd21790ff341d4acc2f3645366683c932f937b/201_190_2122_1273/master/2122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=073533ee7377cf87f2d54824882aeafe","title":"manchester united v burnley arsenal v cardiff and more premier league live","story":"Manchester United denied Burnley at the death, Arsenal beat Cardiff 2-1 and Fulham came back from 2-0 down to beat Brighton 4-2Big results near the top and bottom of the Premier League, with Manchester City suffering a potentially fatal defeat, Newcastle five points clear of the drop zone, and Fulham coming back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 against Brighton.

I can’t work out if that’s a good or bad result for either Manchester United or Burnley. 90+4 min: Solskjær looks remarkably calm on the sidelines, as the home crowd roar Manchester United forward again. Let’s just say Sean Dyche doesn’t look as serene. A late, late equaliser! Young crosses to the back post, United have men over. Heaton makes a remarkable save from Sanchez’s header, but Lindelof is there to turn the ball in from a tight angle. Heaton did actually get a hand to the rebound but it squirmed into the side-netting. Old Trafford erupts and Manchester United again sprint back to the half-way line. They want a winner! 90+1 min: Burnley are absolutely camped on the edge of their own are. Pogba works some space with a bit of skill away from Cork and fires a powerful strike at goal. Heaton makes a good save, palming it away. As another cross comes in, Heaton gets up well to catch it cleanly. Great goalkeeping. 90 min: Five minutes added on at Old Trafford. Fergie Time. The Frenchman sticks it right into the top left corner. Cracking penalty. Pogba grabs the ball and sprints back to the half-way line. Can Burnley hold on?86 min: A clear tug from Hendrick on Lingard. Pogba steps up with that unmistakeable run-up …Some big goals in the second half, there. Wood glances home a brilliant header from Westwood’s cross. Solskjær’s winning run looks set to come to an end! Manchester City are losing at Newcastle. Huge goal in the title race. Get the latest with Scott Murray. Mendez gets one back, but it look like it’s going to be too late for the Welsh side. And that’s that. This has been an absolutely terrible performance from West Ham, I think they’ve had two shots all game. Jiminez finishes off a wonderful counter-attacking move from Wolves after Obiang has hit pocket picked in the centre circle. Wolves are two on one going forward, Jota squares it to Jiminez and the Mexican dinks it over Fabianski. 85 min: Fulham hit the bar again! Cairney turns inside and curls a brilliant effort on the top of the bar. Ryan was motionless. 83 min: Sublime save from Pickford, who es to his right to palm away Kachunga’s header. “England No1” chant the travelling Everton fans. Huddersfield still 1-0 down against the 10 men but pressing for an equaliser. Some pretty poor defending from Cardiff as Lacazette waltzes into the box, gets a low shot off. Etheridge gets a foot to it, but can’t stop it from squeezing inside the post. That should be the game for Arsenal! Four goals for Fulham in this second half. What a comeback! Cairney hits the bar, the ball falls to Babel, who can’t get it under control, but Vietto stabs it in to give Fulham some breathing space. Surely even they can’t blow this lead from here. Another set piece, another goal for Wolves. It’s nothing less than they deserve. West Ham have been torrid, and Hammers co-chairman David Sullivan looks absolutely miserable in the stands. 77 min: Arnautovic is subbed off injured, so Fabianski is going to have to soldier on in goal for West Ham. Two-nil down at half-time, Fulham now lead! What a game. It’s Mitrovic again, nodding a Bryan cross past Ryan. 60 min: Solskjær has hooked Pereira for Lingard as Manchester United try to get back into the game. The Brazilian looks absolutely crestfallen as he plods towards the bench. Burnley still 1-0 up at Old Trafford. 70 min: Jota is absolutely furious that Wolves haven’t been awarded a penalty for a tackle by Zabaleta. It’s a close call. Zabaleta certainly made contact but then won the ball. If that was lucky for West Ham, Arnautovic has an ankle problem and Fabianski has also gone down in a heap after a 5050 challenge with Doherty. The Hammers have already made two changes. 67 min: Digne has only just come on for Baines, remember. The former Barcelona is sent off for bringing down Diakhaby as he ran through one-on-one. Huddersfield still 1-0 down but right back in this. This goal is all Andreas Pereira’s fault. The Brazilian loses the ball on the edge of his own area. Burnley swarm on him with a high press, Cork nicks the ball, feeds Barnes and the forward makes no mistake, smashing the ball high into the roof of the match. Kolasinac goes down in the area under the challenge of Manga and Aubameyang makes no mistake from 12 yards. A big goal for Arsenal, who have looked very pedestrian this evening. Fulham are level! A remarkable turnaround at Craven Cottage! It’s a bouncing ball in Brighton’s box, nobody takes the initiative, including Ryan in goal, and Mitrovic simply rises above three Brighton players and nods the ball into the net. Calamitous defending. You’d back Fulham to win it from here. 56 min: Saiss is the latest to go close for Wolves! West Ham are really hanging on, they have offered nothing going forward, and Fabianski does really well to get down to his right to deny Wolves’ Moroccan midfielder. 54 min: Fulham are really going for it now. They are leaving gaps at the back, and are open to the counter-attack, but have thrown bodies forward, and brought Vietto on from the bench. A few changes to tell you about. Alex Iwobi has come on for Arsenal, replacing Elneny, who was fairly dreadful in the first half. Meanwhile, at Huddersfield, Aaron Mooy has come on for the home side. Huge cheers for the Australian, who is back after the Asian Cup. He’s been sorely missed. Leighton Baines has gone off injured for Everton, with Digne coming on. Fulham are back in it! Chambers gets his first goal for Fulham, volleying a sensational shot into the top corner. That has really livened up the crowd, and two minutes later Mitrovic is denied an equaliser by a brilliant Duffy challenge. The 7.45pm games are back underway for the second half. Half-time at Old Trafford: Manchester United 0-0 Burnley. Staying on the continent, new £31m Krzysztof Piatek has scored two on his Milan debut against Napoli in the Coppa Italia. Wowee. I can’t say that I’m watching Monaco v Guincamp, but fortunately Kári Tulinius is, and he’s emailed in.“I switched over to the French league cup semifinal between Guincamp and Monaco as it started and haven’t been disappointed. So far, with thirty minutes played the following has happened, William Vainqueur was shown a straight red for a horrendous tackle on his Monaco debut, Rony Lopes scored a bicycle kick for Monaco, there was a hailstorm, and Golovin added another for Monaco, his first for the club.”Half-time at Swansea, who are drawing 1-1 with 10-man Birmingham, while it’s goalless between probably the league’s poorest two teams: Bolton and Reading. That last one is a 8pm KO. 38 min: Manchester United are starting to turn the screw now. Paul Pogba has the ball in the Burnley net after flicking a cross past Heaton, but he is correctly flagged offside. Burnley are slightly hanging on here, but credit to Tarkowski and Mee at the heart of their defence, they have both been excellent. 35 min: Great save from Tom Heaton to deny Lukaku! The Belgian was actually penalised for a foul before shooting, but the Burnley keeper wasn’t to know that, and he got down superbly well to palm Lukaku’s effort over the bar. Heaton has made a real difference for Burnley’s defensive organisation since replacing Joe Hart between the sticks. Here’s today’s Fiver, featuring Alvaro Morata, David Squires and a headbutt (not between Morata and Squires).

Why are they turning to groups that have traditionally opposed feminism?by  Angelique Chrisafis in Paris,  Kate Connolly in Berlin,  Angela Giuffrida in RomeIt was a chastening lesson for any woman tempted to join the cut and thrust of rightwing populism. After Corinna Miazga was elected to the German parliament in 2017 for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, a male colleague suggested she would be better suited to being a pole dancer than an MP.Miazga did not let it rest, getting her own back by telling a party conference of the lewd intervention by fellow MP Petr Bystron. “An ‘Argh’ went up in the audience,” she recalls. “No one could quite believe I’d dared to reveal this. Many people in the AfD were subsequently angry at me. They said: ‘We know you’re cross, but by bringing this into the public arena, you’ll encourage people to say we have a male-female problem in the party.’”A surge in rightwing populism across Europe over the past 20 years has been largely male-dominated – sometimes characterised as angry white men voting for angry white men. But this is changing. Angry white women are emerging as an important constituency, too. At least half a dozen women lead rightwing, populist European parties, such as Alice Weidel, of the AfD, and Giorgia Meloni, of the Brothers of Italy. They follow the leads set by Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (formerly Front National) and, before her, Pia Kjærsgaard, co-founder of the rampantly anti-immigration Danish People’s party, and Norway’s finance minister, Siv Jensen, leader of the country’s similarly anti-immigration Progress party.A new generation of women aged 20 to 50 are in parliament or local government in countries including Germany, France and Italy, following electoral breakthroughs by rightwing populists.Women are taking to the streets, too. Far-right protests in the UK still tend to be overwhelmingly male, but in continental Europe this is changing. At protest marches in the eastern German city of Chemnitz last year (following gatherings prompted by the stabbing of a local man, allegedly by two immigrants), the neo-Nazi Pegida group had plenty of women in the rank and file. It was similar at a rally last year of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy.In France, large numbers of women have taken to the streets as part of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government movement, which has attracted people from across the political spectrum from left to far-right, some of whom vote Le Pen, and whose slogans often echo the disillusioned anti-elitism of populism.“There is evidence the gender gap is shrinking in some countries, although it clearly hasn’t disappeared everywhere,” says Eelco Harteveld of the University of Amsterdam.This raises the question: what do women see in nationalist populism that was once so dominated by patriarchal ideology? What motivates women to elect, support and even stand for parties and movements that shrink away from modern-day feminism?Conversations with dozens of European women – voters, MPs and academics – suggest several elements at play.Many working-class women feel just as “left behind” as their male counterparts. The key predictor of a radical-right vote is the level of a person’s education. Harteveld says that although the precarious manual jobs often associated with far-right voters are still largely male preserves, there is also precarious work in the service sector – where women are more numerous. Political scientists in France have pointed to the disillusionment of retail staff and supermarket cashiers as a case in point.“The elite in power hasn’t got a clue what life is like for real people, they’re totally cut off,” says Catherine, a cashier at a budget supermarket north-east of Paris, who has demonstrated with the gilets jaunes. Now in her mid-30s, she has been working on supermarket tills since she left school, and votes for Le Pen.“We can’t make ends meet on low salaries. I’m overdrawn before the end of each month, living on credit, barely able to afford the petrol to get to work or drive my three children where they need to go. We’ve never tried Le Pen in power, so why not give her a chance?” she says.In Italy, the far right has been particularly adept at winning over women who used to vote for the left. “The left represented by the Democratic party in recent years betrayed leftwing voters and leftwing ideals,” says Gianna Gambaccini, a neurologist who became a council member for Matteo Salvini’s far-right Northern League in Pisa last June.But not every female populist sympathiser is from marginalised corners of society. Probably the most important factor in rightwing populism among women is the same as it is for men: attitudes to immigration and Islam. “Top of the list is always a person’s view of immigration,” Harteveld says.Rightwing populist parties are specifically targeting women with a controversial and contested message that immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, brings with it misogynistic cultures that threaten women’s freedom in Europe – from catcalling women in short skirts to sexual assault. As Le Pen put it: “I am scared that the migrant crisis signals the beginning of the end of women’s rights.”A spate of sexual assaults blamed on groups of immigrant men in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year’s Eve at the end of 2015 provided ammunition for the far right to argue that immigrants were a physical threat, even though government studies have found that the vast majority of attacks on German women – including domestic violence – are perpetrated by German men. “I believe we are the only party in Germany who is really fighting for women’s rights, because we point out we’re in danger of losing the freedoms and rights of women for which we’ve fought for centuries,” says the AfD MP Nicole Höchst.Höchst says she is equally concerned for Muslim women living in Germany, many of whom strive to be educated and find a place in German society, “only to find that in the summer holidays they’re going to be married off to a husband they’ve never met in the country their families originated from”.Leaders such as Le Pen are playing a double game. They reject the term “feminism” because they see it as an instrument of the left, and recoil from equality issues such as gender quotas in politics. Yet they co-opt the notion of “women’s rights”when it suits, chiefly as a pretext to attack what they claim is mass immigration by socially conservative men. Every woman must be protected in their right “to wear shorts or a miniskirt”, Le Pen has argued.“These are strong women leaders, but they step back from feminism,” says Susi Meret of Denmark’s Aalborg University. One young Italian mayor, Susanna Ceccardi of the male-dominated Northern League, even insists on being called “sindaco”, the masculine word for “mayor”, as opposed to “sindaca”.These parties believe that “leftwing feminism turns a blind eye to the consequences of immigration,” says Ann-Cathrine Jungar, from Sweden’s Södertörn University.Yet radical-right politicians in Europe know that the stigma and toxic image of a party affects whether female voters choose it. Some have sought to modernise or soften their image in response. Le Pen, who promotes herself as a twice-orced single mother, has sought to tone down her party’s anti-abortion stance, move away from the traditional view of women as childbearers and homemakers, and appeal to gay voters. Jensen, who has warned about the “sneaking Islamisation” of Norwegian society, last year controversially won a “gay best friend” award given out by LGBT activists.The AfD likes to popularise an idealised vision of the nuclear family, with father at work and mother raising children. Miazga speaks of a nostalgia for the deutschmark, for economic stability, social order and the “traditional family”. “I value the traditional family, a sensible time when children were cared for,” she says. “I wish – and maybe this is a funny, romantic feeling – that we could get back to the Germany of the 1990s.”Yet the party’s promotion of the nuclear family is often at odds with the reality of leading women in the AfD. Weidel, for example, is a gay woman bringing up two children with her partner.With just four months to go until European elections that will pick a parliament to sit until 2024, the female vote will be crucial to the success of rightwing populists seeking to build on the 50-odd MEPs they have in the 751-seat chamber.Le Pen’s party, currently polling level with Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche, hopes to harness the fury unleashed by the gilets jaunes movement – and court the high number of working-class women who have taken to the streets. These include single mothers and working mothers on low incomes. In Italy, Meloni, has already been savvier at appealing to other women. “She attracts more women as she seems to be the only one making the battle for women,” says Letizia Giorgianni, who voted for the party last year.Esther Lehnert, a rightwing-populism expert from Berlin’s Alice Salomon University, says the party remains “steeped in chauvinism and sexism. It revels in this sort of leery sexist blokeism.” She recalls some of the AfD’s more controversial election posters, including one showing five naked female behinds, accompanied by the slogan: “For ersity”.Hochst Höchst is trying to change things. “People are repeatedly asking me why the AfD wants women to go back to the hearth,” says the single mother of four. “It’s simply not true. What we do advocate is that women should have the choice to stay at home if they want to, or to work.”The newly founded group FridA, or Frauen in der AfD (Women in the AfD), formed in early November, is Höchst’s answer to the charge that the party has not so far done enough to make itself welcoming to female newcomers. “Before I joined the party, there were countless times I was shopping at the market in my hometown and I didn’t approach the AfD information point, because there were only men there. As soon as there were women, I approached them instinctively,” she says.Lehnert says the future of the party may depend on whether it increases female support. “On a certain level, many people in the AfD recognise that they have to change and attract more women if they’re to have a chance to become an established ‘people’s party’. At the same time, I believe that these chauvinistic habits are so deep-set that I can’t see them arranging themselves differently. Typically, when women start to take up too much space in rightwing populist parties, they will at some point be put back in their place.”Both Miazga and Höchst see themselves as tough-skinned lone warriors, who regularly work 18 hour days. Both have received threats, with Höchst saying that her house is often smeared with offensive graffiti. Both were once top sportswomen and argue this has helped them to succeed in the AfD. “I could kill every man in the party,” said Höchst, who practices karate. But, she adds quickly: “Of course, I don’t want to.”Miazga’s favourite phrase when talking about the male-female ide in the party is to joke: “It takes just 10 of us to keep the 82 men in check”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c0f930bbe2ca9ad9f6f309194f933ccd70c040/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613ee4745957153c1df2ed6b86490ab6","title":"meet the cleanfluencers the online gurus who like things nice and tidy","story":"Marie Kondo may be the biggest name in decluttering, but Instagram is awash with cleaning experts with millions of followersIt may not be spring yet, but everybody’s cleaning. Or, at the very least, they are talking about it. It has only been a month since Tidying Up With Marie Kondo launched on Netflix, but the series, starring the Japanese organisation expert, has already become something of a phenomenon. It has sparked joy among some, and arguments about how many books you should have in your home among others (Kondo, controversially, caps her collection at about 30). It has also led to charity shops reporting a Kondo-related surge in donations as converts go on decluttering sprees.Kondo, who shot to global fame in 2014 when her book The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up was published in English, is probably the biggest name on the clean scene. However, she is far from the only person to have organised their way to celebrity. The past year or so has seen cleaning take on a new cultural cachet – particularly on Instagram. The social network is rife with hashtags such as #cleaningobsessed or #cleaningtime and people are amassing enormous followings with pictures of gleaming kitchen counters and sparkling floors. Fitness influencers and fashion bloggers step aside: it’s starting to look like bleach is the new black.Sophie Hinchcliffe, AKA Mrs Hinch, is one of the best known of these new Instagram “cleanfluencers”. The 28-year-old hairdresser from Essex has 1.7 million followers on the social network, where she shares pictures of her immaculate home as well as chatty videos of herself disinfecting her bins and scrubbing her sink. She has developed a whole branded vocabulary around tidying up – cleaning is “hinching” buying products is a “hinch haul” her followers are the #HinchArmy and her enormous collection of cleaning paraphernalia is kept in a special wardrobe called Narnia. (CS Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.)Other prominent British cleanfluencers include Lynsey “Queen of Clean” Crombie, who has 104,000 followers, and Gemma Bray, “the Organised Mum”, with 135,000. Across the Atlantic, Toronto-based Melissa Maker has more than a million subscribers to her YouTube channel, Clean My Space, where she posts videos such as Cleaning the Kitchen Sink! and 10 Things to Toss Today. In the US, Chicago-based Becky Rapinchuk has 275,000 followers on her Clean Mama Instagram page a typical post shows a gleaming toilet with tips on how to speed-clean your bathroom.For the uninitiated, scrolling through pictures, or watching videos, of people doing chores may seem as exciting as, well, watching surfaces dry. So what is the attraction of all these tidy toilets and spotless sinks?Dr Stephanie Baker, a sociology lecturer at University of London and the author of a forthcoming book about digital lifestyle gurus, points out that we have been obsessed with domestic goddesses for centuries. The online influencers, she says, are simply the latest evolution of “the broader self-improvement movement, which had its origins in the 19th century and achieved tremendous growth in the late 20th with the rise of lifestyle media and make-over programmes”.But why has cleaning taken off on Instagram, which is notorious for its highly filtered, aspirational content?Kate Joynes-Burgess, the managing director of BCW, a PR agency that works with digital influencers, suggests the public is tiring of photos of attractive people doing headstands on remote beaches, posing in fabulous outfits and socialising with photogenic friends. “The world of mega lifestyle influencers has been criticised as being on the cusp of an ‘authenticity crisis’ and potentially reaching a saturation point,” she says. “This has seemingly made way for more niche-focused influencers and conversations to blossom.”The Queen of Clean, who I am chatting to shortly before she sets off to do the school run, agrees that she and her peers represent a much-needed antidote to Instagram’s curated perfection. “We’re more relatable than a lot of the lifestyle bloggers out there,” Crombie says. “We’ve got our mops up, hair sticking up … I look like a right rough tramp on Instagram, but I get people writing in to say it’s refreshing.”The Organised Mum has a similar view. Bray notes that when she first started out on Instagram, “as a mum of three, a lot of the things I was seeing were out of reach”. In 2016, her son dared her to start an Instagram page where she could show off her special cleaning method she indulged him, but didn’t think it would get much traction among all the carefully filtered pictures of avocado toast. But within 12 months she had 10,000 followers and, over the past few months, she has seen her following rocket to well over 100,000. It seems she struck a chord. After all, she says, “everyone has to maintain a home to some extent. Everyone has to do boring jobs.”Like Bray, Crombie, who joined Instagram to keep an eye on her kids’ online usage, started posting cleaning pictures without any expectations they would become so popular. “It’s surreal,” she says. She is reluctant to discuss exactly how much money she is making (“People can be very negative about these sorts of things”), but notes she is earning more than she ever has before. Instagrammers can make money from affiliate marketing, paid reviews and sponsored posts, with brands paying anywhere from a few hundred pounds to hundreds of thousands to partner with people they deem influential.And no wonder: when Mrs Hinch extolled the virtues of a Minky M Cloth antibacterial cleaning pad last year, the item promptly sold out for weeks. The Minky website even crashed because of the demand. The company says it has seen a big uplift in its profile and sales thanks to the influencer, “for which we are extremely grateful”.Cleaning influencers may not be doing anything for the housework gender gap, but that isn’t to say they are not empowering. There is a lot of research that shows messy spaces can lead to depression and fatigue. Crombie is one of the most outspoken influencers when it comes to championing links between mental health and cleaning, and she speaks from personal experience. In 2003, seven months into her first marriage, its traumatic collapse sent her into premature labour her twins were born at 28 weeks. Over the following years, she struggled to rebuild her life and found cleaning gave her structure as well as being cathartic. “If I hadn’t cleaned, I would have stayed in bed all day,” she says, grimly. She expands upon this in her new book, How to Clean Your House … And Tidy Up Your Life, which will be published in March.Crombie’s experience, of course, is extreme. But the link between cleaning your house and tidying your life seems to explain a lot about the current cultural cachet around cleaning. In fact, says Baker, you could say that the “rise of cleaning influencers is fundamentally about order. It is about more than having a clean home it is about creating a structured environment in which to flourish.” She points out that cleaning metaphors are embedded in the “language of lifestyle gurus and psychologists. Look at Jordan Peterson, whose phrase ‘Clean up your room’ recently became a meme in popular culture.” (It’s a shame more men aren’t taking his directive literally.)A desire for order at a time of social unrest may also account, to some degree, for the popularity of Kondo. In her book Waste: Consuming Postwar Japan, Eiko Maruko Siniawer, a history professor at Williams College, Massachusetts, notes that the rise of professional declutterers in Japan coincided with the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people in the country. This disaster, she says, may have prompted a reassessment of “stuff” and what it means to one’s life.Bearing all this in mind, it is perhaps no surprise that the rise of cleaning influencers in the UK and US comes against the background of Brexit and Donald Trump. “The preoccupation with order and self-management flourishes during uncertain times as a self-improvement strategy,” Baker claims. In other words, when the world looks increasingly like trash, cleaning becomes a lot more comforting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592ce3410ad68722f991e24824b4d2ececc61675/0_172_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47632575e6b629b4da59e3934fafffa3","title":"sedivackuv long sled dog race 2019 in pictures","story":"Only half of the 100 ‘mushers’ who braved one of Europe’s toughest sled dog races, the Czech long trail, finished the competition, which was hit by severe weather"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85a62f809857c0f3e24a9bc48b062f83b91d0a54/0_86_2955_1773/master/2955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e18aa229ac829ce1d94ccb7a0856a61","title":"the catholic church faces its past","story":"Last year investigations around the world showed that historical sexual abuse within the Catholic church had been covered up for decades.

After a series of votes that had decided almost nothing, other than that the House of Commons didn’t want a no-deal – though not enough to do anything much about it – and that she should go back to Brussels in search of a deal that wasn’t on offer, Theresa May made a short statement.She was going to phone Michel Barnier – from a withheld number, as the EU’s chief negotiator had blocked her Downing Street landline as he was sick to death of having the same, pointless conversation – and if anyone from any other party had anything constructive to add, then she’d go through the motions of listening to them. Workers’ rights? Whatever they were, she loved them. And the backstop? Bad, very bad.Nothing much had changed. We were back to almost where we had been two weeks previously. And two years before that. We were just a bit closer to a no-deal. Through inertia, as much by design. There was no hope. Only a vague sense of futility. Tumbleweed rolling, rolling, rolling. Time passing. The pound falling. Life and reason slipping away.The prime minister had opened the debate by observing she had recently consulted widely with members of all parties and come to the conclusion that doing anything to keep the Conservative party together for an extra couple of weeks was more important than the national interest. She was now urging the House to vote down the deal she had insisted only a few days ago was the best Brexit deal that could be possibly negotiated and support instead an amendment instructing her to go back and reopen the withdrawal agreement that the EU had insisted couldn’t be reopened.Even in the by-now familiar Alice in Wonderland world of Schrödinger’s Brexit, where everything can simultaneously be and not be, this was a bit of a stretch for many on the opposition benches. Chris Leslie wondered quite how she squared away her claim to be able to secure a deal by ditching the Northern Ireland backstop with her insistence that rejecting the backstop would inevitably end in a no-deal.This was a category error, as it assumed May’s mind followed sophisticated rules of logic. Her algorithms are much more basic: a 1980s Amstrad programmed merely to secure her survival to the end of the day. At which point her memory is erased. Contradicting herself was the least of her concerns.Here was the deal. She had originally intended for her plan B to be exactly the same as her plan A, but at the last minute it had come to her attention that Kit Malthouse, one of her junior ministers – along with a bit of help from the European Research Group – had done a bit of Brexit moonlighting and come up with a plan C. Or to give it its full name, plan C minus.So she was now fully signed up to plan C minus that would entail her going back to the EU on a pointless mission to waste a few more weeks and make a no-deal more likely. With that in mind, she was backing the Graham Brady amendment – a simple idea from an extremely simple man – that would instruct her to go back to Brussels and seek some alternative arrangements. She didn’t know what these arrangements might be other than they would be alternative. Possibly involving a mixture of grunge and Morris dancing. Either way she was looking forward to losing a negotiation conducted entirely with herself.This prompted predictable whoops from several of the Brexiters in her own party, with Nigel Evans declaring that Jerry didn’t like it up ’em. Nicky Morgan burst into tears. She was suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and had lined up with the ERG because she could no longer tolerate the idea of remaining a backbencher. Just someone love me, she sobbed. Because she can no longer love herself.In reply, Jeremy Corbyn had little to say. But he was damned if he was going to let anyone else get a word in edgeways, refusing to take interventions from anyone he didn’t much like. He has a small friendship group. It was unnecessarily petty and provoked a meltdown on the Tory benches. Cue a near shambles, with dozens of MPs going out of their way to embarrass themselves. Not that they generally need much invitation.Brexit continues to make fools of all those with whom it comes in contact. Especially those that were already fools. Give it time and most MPs will be only able to speak in non-verbal grunts. A rare win-win. They’d probably make more sense that way. By the close there was almost no one in the house. Had anyone from the EU been bothering to listen in to such a dismal debate, they’d probably conclude they were far better off without us anyway. This is the new UK.

We will also continue the EU’s process of ratification of the agreement reached with the UK government. President Tusk will stay in close contact with EU27 leaders.”Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach, said in response to the result that the EU needed to “hold our nerve”.MPs were corralled by the prime minister on Tuesday to back a proposal under which the Commons would commit to supporting the withdrawal agreement should the Irish backstop contained within it be replaced.But even as the prime minister had called on MPs to send a message to Brussels, Macron had insisted that such a rallying cry would be fruitless. Speaking in Cyprus, the French president said the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, “is the best accord possible. It is not renegotiable”. He added that a no-deal scenario was one that “no one wants but we should all prepare for”.During a phone call with the prime minister on Tuesday afternoon before the vote, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had already warned May that the EU would not budge on its refusal to renegotiate.Under the terms of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, the whole of the UK would stay in a customs union until an alternative arrangement, such as a comprehensive trade deal or technological solution, ensured the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Brexiters fear being stuck in a customs union would kill off their hopes of the UK furthering an independent trade policy. Tory MPs have variously made calls for the backstop to be removed from the Brexit deal or for a unilateral exit mechanism or time limit on such an arrangement to be inserted.May told MPs that supporting the Brady amendment would show the EU that there needed to be “significant” and “legally binding” changes to the Irish backstop to reassure MPs the UK would not be trapped within it.She said this would involve opening up the withdrawal agreement rather than merely securing “an exchange of letters” with the EU’s leaders offering reassurances, a gambit that failed before the last vote on the deal, which was lost by a historic 230 votes.But EU officials and diplomats said the Brady amendment was too vague for the EU’s heads of state of government to be confident that one particular course of action would receive the full support of parliament for a deal.The slim result in favour of the amendment – by 16 votes – underlined to the EU that there could be no certainty that changes to the backstop would result in the withdrawal agreement being passed by the Commons given the various shades of views on how radical the changes would need to be.A senior EU official outlined the limits to how far Brussels could go. “We will not reopen the withdrawal agreement”, the official said. “So it may be about semantics of what ‘reopening’ means. If things go towards more declarations, assurances or statements – we can do that. But if she really wants to reopen the whole thing, then it’s a ‘no’.”There have not been any formal discussions in Brussels among the 27 other member states over how they might react to developments in London over the past two weeks. But while the EU’s institutions have offered an uncompromising position in public, diplomats representing some member states in the negotiations said informal discussions had been held in the corridors of the EU’s institutions about time limits on the backstop and exit mechanisms.But the diplomat said the decision would be Ireland’s and the rest of the EU27 would look to Juncker and Tusk to recommend any course of action. “It is very difficult for member states to direct these things,” the diplomat said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1124acf4d3b517340872ecb179579f80dd40d473/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994f43bb05358fb2ccc0be3a8ed1cbe8","title":"mps best quotes from the brexit debate","story":"Key soundbites from Tuesday’s Commons debate on Theresa May’s EU withdrawal dealTheresa May: “The world knows what this house does not want.

So tonight we have the opportunity to take ‘no deal’ off the table.”Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary: “It’s one thing for backbenchers to lay an amendment at odds with the prime minister’s deal. It’s quite another for the prime minister to support it – unless of course she’d already got an indication from the EU that they could and would negotiate the necessary changes. But she hasn’t.”Nick Boles, Tory MP who co-sponsored a defeated amendment seeking to avoid no deal: “I am seriously committed to making a success of Brexit, but there are two parts to that sentence – there’s Brexit and there’s success. And Brexit on 29 March with no deal will not be a success. It will be a disaster. It will sour the British people against the operation of their government for a generation, and I cannot have that on my conscience.”Tory Dominic Grieve, who’s amendment was also defeated: “One has to keep in mind and respect the decision of the referendum, but that does not mean that you simply say that you’re going to drag the country out on terms that nobody seems to very much support towards a future which on the face of it looks pretty bad. And that is an abdication of our responsibility.”Conservative MP Graham Brady: “By voting for amendment N we can send the prime minister back to Brussels to negotiate and we can do so having strengthened her hand, able to say that she has a real mandate from this house and to ask for real change.”Labour’s Stella Creasy: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results… Citizens’ assemblies are not about replacing MPs and not about cancelling or giving up on parliament. They’re about stopping the games that we have seen being played in this place – the horse-trading, the unicorn hunting, that have meant that we are in this gridlock.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a7158c43f45ccc69024be200e352cdf2747537e/20_0_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f2ae05b5fd6955d473784bc18bc5872","title":"brexit vote commons latest news developments liam fox says may now saying withdrawal deal text must be rewritten politics live","story":"Commons also backs non-binding amendment to reject no-deal Brexit, as EU says withdrawal agreement is ‘not open for renegotiation’An interesting snippet from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn who reports that Theresa May’s capitulation to Tory hardliners was “total” and even includes their requests that she shakeup her Brexit negotiating team. He reports that she will welcome on board Julian Braithwaite, the UK’s permanent representative to the UN and WTO in Geneva, and Crawford Falconer, the chief trade negotiation adviser at the Department for International Trade. They are described as “two seasoned negotiators”, which does make you wonder why they weren’t in the team to begin with. There a more gossipy morsel on Twitter from the Times reporter Sam Coates who quotes a government source as saying they hope May is collecting air miles because “she won’t bring back much else” from Brussels.Those of you who have been following all day will know that the pound dropped sharply in value after MPs passed the Brady amendment giving more time for May to recast her deal with Brussels.After rising in value for a couple of weeks, it was trading at about $1.32 earlier in the day. But sterling has fallen to $1.3083 in the wake of the vote because investors reckon the chances of a no deal Brexit are now higher.Our economics editor Larry Elliott has filed this story where you can read more about the foreign exchange movements.Good morningafternoonevening wherever you might be following us. I’m Martin Farrer and I’m taking over the blogging reins from Kevin Rawlinson. And following on from Kevin’s last post here are a few more front pages. We’ll start with the Sun, which declares “Backstop from the brink” in its splash headline. It says Theresa May now has the “wind in her sails” to go back to Brussels and demand changes to the Irish backstop. It was a double triumph, the paper says, because she also managed to defeat Yvette Cooper’s amendment to delay Brexit.The  has the puns working well with “Over to EU” as its headline. It says MPs have thrown the PM a “lifeline” by giving her another two weeks to renegotiate her Brexit deal.Here’s a look at the front pages of tomorrow’s papers., the Financial Times and the Daily Mirror have similar takes on the Brexit news noting that, while Parliament may want Theresa May to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, Brussels has said it will not be accommodating.The Times focuses on May’s success in uniting her party, though – like the three above – it notes the EU’s reticence to play along.The Daily , the Daily Mail and the  have fewer reservations.The Remain-supporting Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, has told the same programme she finds her “party drifting to the right”, adding:We have had pitiful leadership both in my party and in the Labour party. People are not putting their country first and foremost, and I can quite assure you that people like me are absolutely putting the country and our constituents’ interests first.Loyalty to your party in these circumstances should be absolutely way down the list, and it is for me. Then, as I observe my party and the way it is going, I despair. I despair at what is happening to our country.Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has told BBC Newsnight it has been a “positive day” that has shown there is a majority for the prime minister’s deal, as long as some changes are made to the backstop.That to me is a significant way forward. It means we can go back to the EU with a united view of what we want here in the UK.She said Theresa May now has the mandate from the Commons to go back to Brussels and ask for something new, and that the ball is now in the court of the 27 member states.The EU have to be flexible as well, they have asked us what would it take for the House of Commons to support this, we have shown that. But we are going to need to see some flexibility over the next few days.The EU has insisted – both before the vote and after – that it does not consider the withdrawal agreement up for renegotiation.Following the same line as the rest of the European Union, the Irish government has reiterated its position that the terms of the UK’s exit are not up for renewed discussion. In a statement released after tonight’s votes, it said:The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council. It has not changed. The withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation.The agreement is a carefully negotiated compromise, which balances the UK position on customs and the single market with avoiding a hard border and protecting the integrity of the EU customs union and single market.The best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify this agreement.The statement also said changes could be made to the political declaration, the portion which sets out the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU, if the former was willing to change its red lines.But the Irish government added it would continue with its contingency planning for all eventualities, including for a no-deal scenario.The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, places the blame for that squarely at Parliament’s door and believes the decision should be taken out of the hands of MPs.Parliament has contradicted itself tonight. MPs were right to vote to reject a no-deal Brexit. But they also voted to send Theresa May back to Brussels to renegotiate the withdrawal deal, which the EU has already said they will not do – this is delaying the inevitable. In reality this makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit more likely.This shows, once again, that it’s time to take this out of politicians’ hands, and give the public the final say on Brexit – with the option to stay in the EU.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the People’s Vote campaign agrees. Alison McGovern, a Labour MP and a supporter of the group, has said:Today, it became clear that Parliament will continue to be gridlocked and the only way forward now is a public vote.The effect of this Brady amendment is open up another round of fantasy Brexit. It means the government will go back to Brussels yet again, telling the EU to rip up the withdrawal agreement and allow a transition period without a backstop. The EU says this can’t happen.But, even if there was a last-minute concession by the EU on the backstop, with all the risks to peace in Ireland that would entail, this amendment ignores the fact that most MPs who voted against the prime minister’s deal have concerns that go way beyond the backstop.It has not escaped people’s notice that, until recently, Theresa May was saying the backstop had to form part of the withdrawal agreement. One of those people is the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, who has described the prime minister’s claim she can renegotiate the deal in the light of tonight’s votes as “staggering”.With no new ideas and red lines firmly still in place, the UK government is simply running down the clock in a vain hope that their deal will pass. Today has lost us more crucial time and the UK government must take decisive action and act on the majority will of parliament to rule out no deal.While May assured MPs she could go to Brussels armed with a mandate to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement, the EU has already insisted no such negotiations will take place.Labour Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nick Boles have put out this statement about the defeat of the Cooper amendment.Tonight MPs have voted to stop no-deal Brexit. We did not get enough support to ensure there could be a binding vote to avert no deal or require an extension of article 50 if needed. We remain deeply concerned that there is no safeguard in place to prevent a cliff edge in March 2019 if the prime minister does not get a deal agreed in time.The prime minister promised a new meaningful vote on 13 Feb and a new amendable motion in the event that this motion is defeated or the government does not secure a new deal. But we are running out of time. She will need to reflect the Commons opposition to no deal. We will consider what amendments will be needed if at that point no progress has been made. We remain committed to ensuring that we don’t reach the cliff edge on 29 March without a deal.That’s all from me for tonight.Here are the lists of Labour and Conservative MPs who rebelled in tonight’s votes. I’ve taken them from the Press Association wires.There were two Labour rebels who voted against: Sir Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) and Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Limehouse).There were 14 Labour rebels who voted against.

While they view the non-binding vote against a no-deal Brexit as a bonus, and are moderately relieved that there is now at least a Commons majority for something, overall they are still fairly gloomy. Here are the key quotes.From Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI:This is another deeply frustrating day for British business. The never-ending parliamentary process limps on while the economic impact of no-deal planning accelerates.The Brady amendment feels like a throw-of-the-dice. It won’t be worth the paper it is written on if it cannot be negotiated with the EU. Any renegotiation must happen quickly – succeed or fail fast.From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:Another day lost while the clock is ticking. Government and parliament are still going round in circles when businesses and the public urgently need answers.The real-world result of Westminster’s interminable wrangling is market uncertainty, stockpiling, and the ersion of staff, money and investment. For every big-ticket business announcing high-profile Brexit-related decisions, there are many more quietly making the changes they need in order to safeguard their operations in the event of a disorderly Brexit. The net result of this displacement activity and uncertainty is slow but very real damage to the UK economy.From Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors:While it is something that MPs have managed to form a majority in any vote, the path ahead is still far from clear. The prime minister clearly faces a difficult task in winning a compromise on the backstop. However, if the choice is between trying to change the deal and leaving without one, business will have to hope the EU can be flexible and consider whether any legal changes at all could further clarify that the backstop is not a permanent fixture.From Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses By passing the Spelman-Dromey amendment, parliament has formally echoed the voice of small businesses that a no deal exit in 59 days’ time is not an option. The amendment does not have any force in law, so a no-deal Brexit on 29 March isn’t off the table yet. This vote cannot simply be a symbolic one, we need government and parliament redouble efforts to prevent it.Small businesses are not ready, and the country is not ready for this scenario. Tonight has seen a small but significant step that shows parliament falling into line with the UK small business community, which is a small relief. However, we cannot lose sight of the reality that we are still no closer to securing a pro-business deal before 29 March.From Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers:While further delay does nothing to relieve the uncertainty hanging over the country, it is at least encouraging to see parliament saying it won’t support a no-deal outcome. It is vital that we not only have an orderly withdrawal but that we are set up to succeed in agreeing a mutually beneficial future relationship with our EU partners.The EU27 are very good at message discipline. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has just issued a statement through his office that reads very like the one from Donald Tusk. (See 8.55am. A spokesperson for Varadkar said:The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European council. It has not changed. The withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation.The agreement is a carefully negotiated compromise, which balances the UK position on customs and the single market with avoiding a hard border and protecting the integrity of the EU customs union and single market. The best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify this agreement. We have consistently said that we want the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK. A change in the UK red lines could lead to a change in the political declaration on the framework for the future relationship, and a better overall outcome. We will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including for a no-deal scenario.This is from Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.And she tweeted this earlier too, in response to a tweet from my colleague Jessica Elgot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bbf3a7d80afcc5feb78833ae7fb5dc9a8952bbe/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f3ef3a2a4cec3af9895179b1bb6406","title":"forget the gym five ways to get fit for free","story":"Exercise doesn’t have to be expensive. From gardening ‘workouts’ to training with Serena Williams, there are ways to be frugal and fitIf getting fit is up there on your 2019 to-do list, then you may be tempted to stump up the cash for a pricey gym membership. Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas. All you need to do is commit, workout, then repeat.Running is one of the most affordable ways to get fit. To start with, you really don’t need a lot of expensive kit a pair of running shoes – and, for women, a sports bra – is all you need to get started. If you’re totally new to running, try downloading the C25K 5K Trainer app (iTunes or Android, free), which will get you running the distance in just eight weeks. Once you’ve mastered a 5k, why not seek out your local Parkrun? The free Saturday morning race is timed, so you can keep track of your progress week after week.If you live near the countryside, or you fancy heading off for an active break, then why not seek out the UK’s best hiking routes? Walking is a low-impact exercise – you’re less likely to get injured from a jaunt across the countryside than doing something more intense. You’ll be burning calories and working those muscles, all the while distracted by the scenic views. Head to nationaltrailthe-trails to discover some of the best walking routes our country has to offer.We all know that gym memberships can cost an arm and a leg, and while there are now more affordable options that don’t tie you in, they still involve a monthly outlay. Our Parks offers free workouts, from boxfit and boot camps to yoga and Zumba, in parks up and down the country. Simply set up an online account and book a class near you.If you like the idea of being outside, but you’re not a fan of workout classes, then Green Gym could be for you. It’s a charity organisation that gets volunteers gardening their way to fitness. Each session involves a warm-up and cool down, but the bulk of the “workout” is gardening.Fitness Blender is a website devoted to free workouts of varying lengths and for different abilities – choose from barre, cardio and strength training, plus many more. It’s this decade’s answer to the workout DVD.If you travel a lot and want to exercise on the go, then download the Nike Training Club app (iTunes and Android, free) it’s essentially like having Nike’s best trainers and athletes – such as Serena Williams and Cristiano Ronaldo – in your pocket. It boasts more than 100 workouts, including core strength, abs and arms, and glute toner.Don’t think you have the willpower or motivation to work out at home? Anna Samuels, boxing trainer and the BoxxMethod co-founder suggests treating your at-home workout like you would a gym class or personal training session. “Book out time in your diary to do it, otherwise there is always the risk of putting it off until later. With the right mindset and planning, you will find the motivation to start, and with consistency it will become a habit.”OK, this is slightly unusual, but ecstatic dance – where you move to music in any way you please – frees you from confusing routines so you can lose yourself in the rhythm. You don’t need to head to a pricey class instead, load up Spotify or iTunes with your favourite, energy-boosting tunes and dance like no one’s watching. The benefits?

Stuart Pringle, who is the managing director of the Silverstone circuit and chair of Fopa, was largely positive after the meeting.“There is every indication the message has been received,” Pringle told the BBC. “We were frustrated that we felt we had no option but to take this sort of action. But actually we have had a very positive day. We believe our concerns will be looked at and we as a group of promoters do recognise that ultimately we are all striving for the same thing – a healthy sport. We want to work in a meaningful way to achieve that so we will work collaboratively with them going forward.”Fopa represents 16 of the current 21 meetings on the F1 calendar and, after a meeting on Monday, issued a statement taking the sport’s owner to task. Liberty bought F1 in 2017 and has since been attempting to develop the sport but has yet to make any statement on the meeting with Fopa.The group raised three major issues. There was concern that it was detrimental to the sport for fans to lose free access to content and broadcasting, of particular issue in the UK. Sky TV has exclusive rights to F1 from this year until 2024 with only the British Grand Prix set to be shown on free-to-air television on Channel 4. This was a deal, however, that Liberty inherited from the previous owners and arranged by Bernie Ecclestone.Fopa also criticised a “lack of clarity on new initiatives in F1 and a lack of engagement with promoters on their implementation”. Promoters pay huge fees to host races, with Silverstone expected to pay approximately £20m for this year’s British Grand Prix. The fees are a major source of income for F1 but increasingly promoters have maintained they were unable to meet them.Silverstone activated a break clause in their contract in 2017, arguing that the fees made hosting the grand prix unsustainable. They have yet to agree a new deal and, if they do not, this year will be the last British Grand Prix at the circuit which held the first F1 world championship race in 1950.F1 has been attempting to agree a new race in Miami but is understood to be trying to use a profit-share model rather than a hosting fee, to which Fopa also objected. “New races should not be introduced to the detriment of existing events although the association is encouraged by the alternative business models being offered to prospective venues,” said the statement.Alongside Silverstone, four other circuits have deals that end in 2019: Monza, Hockenheim, Barcelona and Mexico City. “If this continues, Formula One will be racing on second-rate circuits, if any at all,” Pringle said on Monday. “Everyone is disgruntled. Liberty’s ideas are disjointed. We have all been compliant and quiet hitherto, but we have great concerns about the future health of the sport under the people who run it now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bf422c36c0ba0f71395d301069522d462e946a/2261_984_3235_1941/master/3235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9552ddce0e06f0d846b9ee8951e4d1f8","title":"matt forde brexit through the gift shop review the other palace london","story":"The Other Palace, LondonComedy’s rational surveyor of the political scene fires a centrist shot at easy targets from Boris Johnson to Jeremy CorbynThe leftright ide is no longer a useful guide to interpreting modern Britain, Matt Forde tells us in Brexit Through the Gift Shop. The new distinction is: “Are you mad or not?” No guessing on which side of that ide Forde situates himself: the Unspun man is the least mad comedian imaginable, a rational surveyor of the political scene, impugning the sanity of everyone less sensible than he is.The times, obviously, give him plenty of ammunition. Karen Bradley’s ignorance of Northern Ireland Boris Johnson’s London-boroughs analogy for the Irish border issue – yes, these bespeak a deranged political moment. They’re also very well worn, comedically speaking. But this is Forde’s raw material, the stuff of the headlines: Dominic Raab’s Dover gaffe Labour’s summer festival flop. Often, his jokes and his mimicry are very funny – when addressing Kate Osamor’s plagiarised speech, say, or the possibility of a 21st-century general strike. He’s good at illuminating policy by analogy, recasting Corbyn’s stance on Brexit as a visit to a cosmetic surgeon.The Labour leader fares worse elsewhere, as Forde addresses antisemitism, branding Corbyn uniquely prejudiced in the pantheon of British political leaders. “This is a show for anyone,” Forde joked earlier, “as long as you agree” – and there are moments when his centrist assumptions grate. Everyone else’s arguments are wheedling or disingenuous – the Scottish independence campaign’s in particular. Forde’s opinions, meanwhile – backed up with windy phrases like “academics all say” – are offered as common sense.But at least he’s got opinions, and a wealth of information about UK politics and the Brexit moment.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c7e589473743a947bd5d8530bc61e26b97c992/0_0_6226_3736/master/6226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f1c3d0b3fdfaaf8757c4903c13f8d4","title":"apple profits decline iphone sales latest news","story":"Company blames iPhone sales and a downturn in China for reduced revenue, a day after it scrambled to fix FaceTime glitchApple reported its first decline in revenues and profits in over a decade on Tuesday.Revenues from China were $13.17bn during the quarter, a drop of nearly $5bn from a year ago.The results came three weeks after Apple shocked investors with its first profits warning since 2002.It has been a trying month for Apple. On 3 January Apple cut its sales forecasts for the key end of year period citing the “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in China. It was the first profits warning Apple has made since it launched the iPhone, a product that propelled the company into the top tier of tech companies and briefly made it the most valuable company in history.The warning wiped $55bn (£44bn) off the company’s value, led to its shares being briefly suspended and rattled investors worldwide as analysts began to worry about how other companies might be hit by China’s slowing growth.Apple’s share price has since recovered but remains $266bn less than the record-breaking $1tn the company was valued at in August, the first company ever to be valued that high.The results also come a day after Apple scrambled to fix a glitch with iPhone’s FaceTime, a video chat application, that allowed users to listen in on the people they were calling when they did not pick up the call.The company was forced to disable its Group FaceTime feature after it was revealed the bug allowed people to listen to the people they were calling before they answered their phone.The numbers were broadly in line with analysts’ expectations and iPhone revenues were higher than expected.Leading Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that the worst may be over for Apple.

It should act on its principles and press for Eurovision to be relocated to a country where crimes against that freedom are not being committed.”The letter comes as the UK prepares to select its entry for the annual song competition in a public vote on a BBC2 show entitled Eurovision: You Decide, to be aired on 8 February. “For any artist of conscience, this would be a dubious honour,” the letter says. “They and the BBC should consider that You Decide is not a principle extended to the Palestinians, who cannot ‘decide’ to remove Israel’s military occupation and live free of apartheid.”Other signatories of the letter include actors Julie Christie and Maxine Peake musicians Wolf Alice and Roger Waters and writers Caryl Churchill and AL Kennedy. Their letter follows another in September 2018 in which cultural figures from across Europe called on Eurovision’s organisers to “cancel Israel’s hosting of the contest altogether and move it to another country with a better human rights record”.The contest is being held in Israel following the country’s win in 2018, for pop singer Netta’s track Toy. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted the contest to be staged in Jerusalem, but the nationality of the city is disputed, with Palestinians claiming an Israeli-occupied area as a potential future capital city. Instead, Tel Aviv will host the contest, which is scheduled for 18 May. The letter’s authors say the decision “does nothing to protect Palestinians from land theft, evictions, shootings, beatings and more by Israel’s security forces”.Many of the signatories have protested the staging of other cultural events in Israel. Nick Cave and Radiohead are among the musicians criticised for performing in the country in recent years, with others, such as Lana Del Rey and Lorde, cancelling concerts following pressure to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce2a3cf43cbe194b6a9a7c9d4338e254624fe90/0_63_1532_919/master/1532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c03af9f773a6e1fce0a208f83ebdad8","title":"shipwrecked channel four new series","story":"I was on the original reality show and it was so harrowing they wouldn’t even use the actual footage. These pampered new islanders don’t know they’re born Reality TV tends to inspire outrage consider the Ofcom complaints generated by Dani Dyer’s “emotional abuse” at the hands of Love Island producers, or the bile directed at Strictly’s Alexandra Burke for being more talented than Middle England felt she had any business being.Shipwrecked, the Channel 4 show in which two islands compete for a cash prize, belongs to a gentler time – one before the watershed moment when Geordie Shore’s Charlotte Crosby was shown simultaneously having sex, farting and wetting the bed. So why did I feel rising indignation while watching the show’s latest reboot? It wasn’t the candid discussion of “doing bits” which began to boil my blood, but the appearance of a pre-assembled, watertight hut. I just about held it together as the new islanders were shown discovering a covered toilet and spacious kitchen, before losing it entirely as they flaunted their … hang on, was that – A SHOWER?I should explain. As a teenager, I was a contestant on the original Shipwrecked. Back then, it was a kind of prototype Love Island as imagined by Bear Grylls, in which young cast went to war with the elements while getting off with each other. For five harrowing months, we subsisted on a diet of rice and tongues (lambs’, cows’ and each others’ – thanks to many mandatory games of spin the bottle).Rations were scarce, in the hope that we might learn to fend for ourselves. But after a few unsuccessful attempts at spearing fish with sticks, most of us settled for getting very, very thin. Occasionally we would distract producers by staging elaborate arguments so that one of us could raid the abandoned crew camp for Crunchies, but despite these heroic efforts, one islander lost five stone. Others attempted to stave off rickets by prising sea snails off rocks and eating them raw.Our attempts at building were similarly pitiful, but, in fairness, have you ever tried to build a weatherproof roof out of leaves? I would not recommend it. Eventually I defected from our flooded, dirt-floored shack to sleep on the other side of the island, where at least the wind allowed you to dry your sleeping bag off between rainstorms. I stopped sleeping alone when we discovered human bones and were told that our island was a former leper colony. In a crowded field, residual leprosy wasn’t even the least glamorous element. That would have been our longdrop – an open-air, urine-soaked wooden box – the contents of which piled ever higher until, sitting on it, you could feel the heat generated by a heaving mound of maggots below.The fact that most of the hairy elements were never shown – “it doesn’t rain on TV” was a common refrain from producers – made our suffering feel arbitrary. If our misery wasn’t even providing entertainment, what was the point? Perhaps it was this that led the new series to eschew any survival element in favour of focusing on fighting and flirting. After all, I learned the hard way that you never feel sexy while suffering from “crotch rot” (an affliction several of us developed from dressing exclusively in wet swimming costumes for months on end). The current format has also reduced the time that contestants are shipwrecked from five months to seven weeks, and has allowed luxuries like moisturiser and mosquito nets, whereas we made sport of counting our infected bites and were instructed to wash with – I wish I was joking – sand.I’m partly jealous that the new recruits will live in paradise without the added complications of sleep exhaustion and skin disease, but then again, our version of the show was very character-forming. I, for one, developed several cute personality quirks – such as my inability to see a tin of lamb tongues without sobbing uncontrollably, or hear a friend’s suggestion of “camping” without lashing out indiscriminately. Sure, the new recruits may luxuriate in conditions we could only have dreamed of, but maybe they have been robbed of our more authentic experience. Perhaps Shipwrecked was never really about the winning, or even the taking part, but the nervous tics we developed along the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cedae6eeec189506b6e7076c048717cc07c29420/0_151_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d0df30db629a4938d8dce36d1ce6106","title":"el chapo defense lasts 30 minutes joaquin guzman","story":"After a prosecution that ned 11 weeks and had its share of bombshells, the defense case at the US trial of the alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán clocked in on Tuesday at a mere 30 minutes.Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman called one witness and entered one document into evidence before resting the defense’s case. The jury was sent home for the day with closing arguments set to begin on Wednesday.Guzmán could face life in prison if convicted of drug and murder conspiracy charges that his lawyers say are fabricated.It’s not unheard of for defense lawyers to call few or even no witnesses. But Guzmán’s fleeting defense was striking because it followed a sweeping case by the government that featured 56 witnesses, including colorful cooperators who described how the notorious boss of the Sinaloa cartel ran his cocaine-dealing empire with an iron fist.There were tales of Guzman running naked through an underground tunnel to evade a manhunt, of hefty cash bribes to top Mexican government and military officials and of the defendant personally torturing and killing his enemies in fits of rage.Prosecutors described the evidence as overwhelming, noting in a court filing on Monday that it included witness testimony, text messages, recorded calls, drug seizures and handwritten letters that the government says prove Guzmán “was a member of a narcotics conspiracy as one of the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel”.By contrast, jurors watched Lichtman briefly question an FBI agent about a 2017 debriefing of one of Guzmán’s cocaine suppliers government witness Jorge Cifuentes who has given shifting accounts about his claim that a US intelligence officer once revealed sensitive investigative information with him.It appeared to be an effort to both attack Cifuentes’s credibility and support the theory that Guzmán was the victim of a conspiracy by the US and Mexican governments to single him out for prosecution.During cross-examinations of prosecution witnesses, defense lawyers grilled the cooperators about their own criminal backgrounds and the deals they cut with prosecutors that could shorten their sentences. The lawyers have claimed that is an incentive to frame Guzmán – a point that is certain to be a central theme of the defense closing argument."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5256f65f13332e6629cd5e8d9b17fe6950ab4978/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d000acaff7b10d765cf8353889bc916b","title":"israel netanyahu chief rival benny gantz launches election campaign","story":"Benny Gantz aims to have broad appeal with message of ‘no more right and left’Israel’s former military chief Benny Gantz has officially launched his election campaign by promising to unseat the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he accused of running a “regime” that “encourages incitement, subversion and hatred”.“We all need a government that solves our real problems and is not preoccupied with itself,” Gantz said during his maiden rally, scheduled for Israel’s primetime television slot. “I thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his service for 10 years. We will continue from here.”Opinion polls suggest Gantz is Netanyahu’s only credible challenger, despite having until now revealed almost none of his political beliefs. After he moved himself into politics in December, polls signalled that his new party, Israel Resilience, could win a critical number of seats in the 9 April general election.The retired general has already created a buzz among an electorate that analysts say often votes on personality rather than policy and has a strong penchant for military credentials.Israel Resilience released a jingle on Tuesday with the slogan “there is no more right and left, there is only Israel before everything”, and Gantz is expected to seek alliances with both sides in a political system favouring coalition governments.Head of the army from 2011 to 2015, including during two wars in the Gaza Strip, Gantz has sought to appease Israel’s militaristic rightwing. A short clip released by his party this month showed a bomb-flattened neighbourhood in Gaza after the 2014 war he led against the strip’s rulers, Hamas.“Only the strong wins,” reads text on the video, which says Israel killed more than 1,364 “terrorists” and destroyed 6,231 targets in the war. According to a scathing United Nations investigation, more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in the 50-day conflict, more than half of them civilians, contradicting Gantz’s figures. Seventy-three people, the vast majority of them military personnel, died on the Israeli side.A Palestinian film company based in Gaza later said the footage, originally filmed to document the damage caused by Israeli bombings, had been “stolen” by Gantz’s team without permission.Army service is compulsory in Israel and the country has a tradition of senior military figures entering politics. Two chiefs of staff have become prime ministers: Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak.Gantz is seen as a serious contender to threaten Netanyahu’s reputation as “Mr Security”, a nickname the prime minister’s supporters use. But Netanyahu’s allies have written off Gantz as a “leftist” and will seek to highlight any signs of restraint from him on Israel’s myriad security challenges.In another campaign video, Gantz says there is “no shame in yearning for peace”, although he adds that Israeli soldiers will probably be fighting for the next 50 years.The general-turned-politician promised that his government would strive to make deals. But he added that if peace did not happen, he would strengthen settlements in the occupied West Bank – regarded as illegal by the international community.Orit Galili-Zucker, who has advised both Netanyahu and his rivals on political communications, said Gantz was adopting a strategy of ambiguity to try to woo rightwing and centre-left voters. “The reason why polls are high for Gantz is because he brings something new, he is shaking the political arena,” she said.Netanyahu is the second longest-serving premier in the country’s history, having won four general elections since 1996. He remains the top contender by far to gather the most seats in the 120-seat Knesset and form a coalition.Polls suggest Netanyahu’s Likud party will take around 30 seats in April, with Gantz’s Resilience party second on 15. Netanyahu would then need to make an alliance, possibly including with Gantz who could be offered a conciliatory ministerial position, to form a 61-seat majority government.However, one of Netanyahu’s biggest election hurdles is a slew of corruption charges. In three cases, police have recommended he be indicted for bribery. Israel’s attorney general is expected to announce his decision on whether to charge Netanyahu before election day. The premier would not be required to step down if indicted.Despite the allegations, which he rejects as a “witch-hunt”, Netanyahu has held on to power through deals with ultra-nationalists and religious parties.In a jab at Netanyahu, Gantz said in his speech: “No Israeli leader is a king.“More and more people, both right and left, myself included, are deeply embarrassed by the way our leadership conducts itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7b25ac3940c12f938e57104bb0358a05fa41f5/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9ef197adaa753bdd2ffc20035eeb89f","title":"libya oil chief calls for national force to guard petroleum installations militias","story":"Mustafa Sanalla says specialist unit needed to end repeated seizures of oil assets by militiasThe head of Libya’s national oil company has said he wants to set up a national force armed with surveillance to protect the country’s petroleum assets after repeated seizures of oil installations by militias.Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), said the force would require an annual budget of $10m (£7.6m) and be under the control of the UN-recognised government. But the force could include members of the Libyan National Army (LNA) headed by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the dominant figure in Libya’s east, he added.Sanalla was speaking to the  as a militia continued to occupy the country’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, in the impoverished south. The army has attempted to capture the site.He said his plan for a national, non-tribal, oil installation protection force should start with a pilot project in El Sharara once it was secured. The force, would exclude anyone involved in previous attacks on oil installations, he continued. “It would rely on radars, cameras drones and fast satellite communications.” Sand barriers and tunnels would also be set up to protect the oil sites.Sanalla expressed his doubts about Haftar’s intervention in the south. The crisis in El Sharara, he said, had been complicated “by the launch of an international counter-terrorism mission, which has expanded into an attempt to seize control of territory, including potentially, national oil infrastructure”.He added: “It is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for Libya and the National Oil Corporation. The south does not need a military solution to what is effectively a humanitarian problem.”Libya’s fractured and often corrupt politics often undermine Sanalla’s goal of defending the NOC’s independence and increasing Libyan oil production.Production reached 1.1bn barrels per day in 2018. Sanalla said 2bn a day could be reached by 2021-2 but that he had yet to reach approval for an NOC budget from the central bank, a delay that frustrates him.He called for a new generation of younger Libyan politicians to advance fresh ideas, urged foreign powers to abandon “rushed unsustainable” solutions, and accused France and Italy of sparring over Libya’s future for internal European political reasons rather than the good of the country. Sanalla said as a Libyan, rather than head of the NOC, he hoped a national reconciliation conference being organised by the UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, would not just focus on elections, but an integrated plans to help the economy. Without economic reform, the result would be “a democracy that will only last one round of elections”, Sanalla said.El Sharara has been closed since December when it was seized by the members of the Maghawir Brigade, a Gaddafi-era armed unit.

By the time a series of smugglers have added their surcharge it can cost as much as 1.5 dinars in the south. The price of basic goods is the highest in Libya there is a serious lack of economic opportunity human development indicators are the worst in the country.”If the government in Tripoli “is not able to enforce subsidies for fuel and other essential commodities”, he said, “then it is time for us to roll back subsidies completely – giving that money directly to citizens instead, not to smugglers who are a plague on the social fabric of the country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8355c4f57057699c26b89dbac11b0dae79205ade/0_307_4634_2782/master/4634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a0bf84644627cba5dd818c5d1ea90f","title":"venezuela juan guaido tarek saab investigation","story":"Crisis deepens as attorney general orders investigation into Guaidó for alleged role in ‘crimes that threaten the constitutional order’Venezuela’s supreme court has imposed a travel ban and financial restrictions on self-declared interim president Juan Guaidó, including freezing his bank accounts.On Tuesday, the political crisis deepened as the country’s attorney general ordered an investigation into the opposition leader, who last week declared himself interim president in a rare challenge to the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro.Tarek Saab, a Maduro loyalist, announced that Juan Guaidó – who has received the backing of the US and other regional powers including Brazil and Colombia – would be investigated over his supposed role in “serious crimes that threaten the constitutional order”.Hours earlier the US tightened the screws on Maduro by announcing sweeping sanctions against the country’s state-owned oil company PDVSA in what experts said was an attempt to economically asphyxiate his regime.A series of anti-Maduro demonstrations are due to take place on Wednesday in Caracas, the capital, and across the country.Guaidó appeared to take the threat of imprisonment in his stride. He said: “We are here, we will keep acting and working to confront the humanitarian crisis.”The US national security adviser, John Bolton denounced the “threats” from Saab – who he described as the “illegitimate former Venezuelan attorney general”.“There will be serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido,” Bolton tweeted.José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, said the move had been expected: “The only question, given the domestic and international support for Guaidó, is if the Maduro dictatorship is able to really flex its muscles and sideline Guaidó like it has with previous opposition leaders.”Maduro’s government has long sidelined or arrested figureheads of movements that threaten his power, such as Guaidó’s mentor Leopoldo López, currently under house arrest after organising protests in 2014. Others leaders have gone into self-imposed exile.Protests that began on Monday last week were met with brutal repression, with the UN human rights office reporting that security forces in Venezuela had detained nearly 700 people last Tuesday, the highest tally in a single day in Venezuela in over two decades.Between Monday and Saturday last week, more than 40 people were killed, and 850 people were detained overall, including 77 children.On Tuesday morning, residents of Petare, a sprawling, downtrodden neighbourhood in Caracas, were still reeling from the crackdown launched after tens of thousands took to the capital’s streets on 23 January. Later that night, police and national guardsmen swarmed the streets of Petare, summarily executing suspected agitators, witnesses told the .“It was horrible, I was terrified by all the gunfire, so much gunfire,” said one resident who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “The police arrived and entered people’s home, and people say they killed people in their own homes who had no criminal records.”Another resident, who also asked not to be named, expressed solidarity with Guaidó in the face of possible legal troubles. “He has done what no other political has done in about 10 days,” the resident said. “I believe in him and I ask that he helps us change Venezuela.”However, there was also support for the move against the opposition leader.“I agree with it because I think that Guaidó is a usurper. He has to respect President Maduro and I think he has to sit down and talk to him and reach an agreement to solve the country’s problems,” said Douglas Flores, 58, a cobbler from the José Félix Ribas neighbourhood in Caracas.“I think was wrong to proclaim himself president and although I do not judge him, I think he should apologize to President Maduro. He was re-elected and that must be respected. We must respect what the constitution says.”Guaidó has said he was aware of the consequences of standing up to Maduro, but said he was not fearful.“I am more afraid of continuing to live in this situation of uncertainty and chaos,” he told the  in an interview last Saturday. “I always think of my daughter when people ask me this, and I have to say my biggest fear is seeing her grow up thinking that this situation is normal. It is not normal and we need to leave the chaos behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f795f4c4b078363391330b4293fe1c619357da/367_759_3099_1860/master/3099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61072cf8da9cc4b1aac7982300bde506","title":"manilas jeepneys in pictures","story":"Part of the Philippine urban landscape for decades, jeepneys, small buses originally made from military vehicles left by the Americans after the second world war, are being phased out.

Photograph: PA WireThe House of Commons has passed an amendment to Theresa May’s Brexit deal which aims to replace the Northern Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The proposal to reopen the withdrawal agreement and find a different solution to the Border issue brought by Conservative Sir Graham Brady was backed by 317 votes to 301 votes. It was one of seven amendments put to the House on Tuesday evening.The so-called backstop, an insurance policy to prevent the return of a hard border in Ireland, would keep the UK in a common customs area with EU in the absence of a free-trade deal.The prime minster said that the result showed there was a means of securing a “substantial and sustainable majority in this House for leaving the EU with a deal” and vowed to seek a new agreement with Brussels.A spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: “The withdrawal agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The backstop is part of withdrawal agreement and the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.”The Irish Government issued a terse statement which stressed that the “withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.” “The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council. It has not changed,” the Government said. It said that the administration would “continue our preparations for all outcomes, including for a no-deal scenario”.An amendment brought forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper lost by 23 votes, 321 to 298. It aimed to postpone Brexit to the end of the year if Mrs May failed to secure a deal by February 26th. Labour MP Rachel Reeves’s proposal which did not specify how long article 50 should be extended for was also rejected.MPs voted 327 to 296 against a proposal made by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn which called for parliament to consider alternative options to prevent Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s proposal was defeated narrowly by 321 votes to 301. It sought to provide six days to debate and vote on alternative options if the withdrawal agreement is rejected, in a bid to avoid a no-deal scenario.MPs backed a vote brought by Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour’s Jack Dromey which states that the UK will not leave the EU without a deal. It is only advisory and has no legislative force.The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on Mrs May to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March 29th if she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels. She told MPs: “I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However, simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it. “The government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this House can support.” There was uproar in the chamber as she said: “There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.” Mrs May said she would seek “legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border”.An amendment put forward by the Scottish National Party seeking to extend article 50 and to ensure Scotland was not taken out of the EU without its consent was also defeated.Earlier on Tuesday, leading Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers produced a joint proposal to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with tariff-free trade and technological measures to keep the Border open. – AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

In its annual residential property review, the society says the Republic’s estate agents remain confident that demand will increase across all property types this year, with prices expected to rise by 4 per cent this year. Last year’s average forecast by SCSI auctioneers and estate agents was 8 per cent, compared with the year-to-November figures from the Central Statistics Office’s Residential Property Price Index, which found an annual increase at 7.1 per cent. Prices in Dublin should rise by 5 per cent this year, compared with the 8 per cent recorded in 2018, according to figures gathered from auctioneers’ and estate agents’ records. However, the CSO again produced more conservative numbers, finding that prices for houses rose by 5 per cent, while those for apartments rose by 6.5 per cent, according to its statistics.Owners of one- and two-bedroom apartments are likely to see the highest price growth next year, with estate agents predicting one-bed apartments will increase in value by 6 per cent. The SCSI’s director general, Áine Myler, said that while the market remained in good health, 2018 sales took five months to complete. Many deals fell through despite an appetite among buyers and sellers to conclude deals. “Homeowners and prospective buyers alike are keen to make the sale happen and move into their next property,” she said. “The challenge for estate agents is managing some vendors’ excessive price expectations.”She said that while she predicted continued house price growth “there will be winners and losers. It’s likely that the property market may correct for some high-value properties in Dublin in particular.” She suggested that for the market to operate efficiently there was a need for “a regular turnover of sales to help purchasers and sellers to keep moving up and down the ladder. Potentially unrealistic asking prices can leave all parties disappointed, curtailing market movement when it’s needed most and as affordability limits kick in.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3775160.1548792946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government rules out additional payments to nurses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Labour Court on Tuesday decided not to intervene formally in the dispute. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The Government is prepared to look at reviews of the roles of nurses or other flexibilities but has insisted it cannot offer additional money outside the public service agreement in either 2019 or 2020, senior figures have maintained.As nearly 40,000 nurses stage a 24-hour work stoppage on Wednesday, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) said the Government had not tabled any “realistic proposals” which could have headed off the strike.The Labour Court on Tuesday decided not to intervene formally in the dispute.After engaging with public service management and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) for eight hours on Monday, the Labour Court concluded an intervention did not hold out the prospect of impacting on the stoppage scheduled for Wednesday.“The court therefore has decided not to formally intervene in this dispute at this time. The court will remain focused on the matter in the coming days as it continues to assess what assistance it might provide at the appropriate time,” it said.INMO director of industrial relations Tony Fitzpatrick said the union was “deeply disappointed that the Government still have no serious proposals to resolve this dispute”.“No nurse or midwife wants to go on strike, but we have been forced into this position by a Government that just isn’t listening.“The largest strike in the history of the health service looms and the Government seemingly has nothing to say. We are always open for talks and to receive realistic proposals to end this dispute.”The Minster for Health Simon Harris said he was disappointed that the strike was going ahead and that health service management remained available for talks with nursing unions.The INMO is seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry health professional grades such as physiotherapists who it maintains are paid about €7,000 more than nurses. The union argues that such increases are necessary to deal with recruitment and retention issues in the health service.Senior figures familiar with Government thinking said it was prepared to look at a review of nursing roles or other non-pay arrangements but that it could not provide additional payments outside the terms of the current public service agreement until it expires at the end of 2020.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government would need funds to deal with jobs losses in the event of a hard Brexit as he faced calls in the Dáil to intervene in the nurses’ dispute.Mr Varadkar said “I have to be a Taoiseach for the whole country” adding that in a few weeks or a few months’ time there could be job losses “and it would be irresponsible of me not to admit that to this House”.The Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe defended pay rates for State employees and argued the health service was able to recruit nurses.He said existing pay arrangements in the public service were attractive with incremental progression, flexible working arrangements and strong pension entitlements compared to the private sector where only an estimated 35 per cent had an occupational pension. “Indeed over the last five years we have recruited an extra 3,876 nurses and midwives or 11 per cent of the total. Importantly these are additional staff, over and above retirements and leavers, and shows that the public service is able to recruit and retain nurses and midwives.“The nursing unions are seeking a significant increase in pay over and above all of the benefits of the current agreement seeking parity with other health professionals.” He said concession of this pay claim, “even if possible, would have serious consequences for the public finances and for public pay policy generally with estimated costs of €300million annually based on a 12 per cent claim in pay”. “However, it would not end there. It would, I have no doubt, generate knock-on or ‘leapfrogging’ claims from the rest of the public service workforce, where there are already other well-aired pay grievances.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3775208.1548796982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"passport service poised for no deal brexit surge in applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWith fewer than 60 days before the UK leaves the EU, demand for passports has caused post offices in Northern Ireland to run out of forms. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe Department of Foreign Affairs is preparing for 300,000 additional applications for Irish passports this year – an increase of more than one-third – in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Passport offices are bracing themselves for another surge in applications should the UK crash out of the EU without a deal, as UK citizens eligible for Irish passports and Northern Irish residents apply or maintain their EU citizenship post-Brexit with an Irish passport.As part of its no-deal contingency planning, the department is projecting another potential massive increase in applications on top of the 800,000 first-time and renewed passport applications expected this year. The Passport Service has already received more than 80,000 passport applications in the first three weeks of this month, representing an increase of 30 per cent on the same period last year. The majority of the applications were renewals which, the department said, showed that people were “planning early, in advance of travel” and responding to a promotional campaign running since last month.At less than 60 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, demand for passports has caused post offices in Northern Ireland to run out of forms.The department sent a fresh batch of application forms to Northern Ireland on Tuesday after former lord mayor of Belfast Niall Ó Donnghaile tweeted a photograph on Monday of a post office public notice in Northern Ireland telling customers that they had no more Irish passport application forms in stock.The post office notice said it had been told “it may be the end of February before we receive new stock”.The department said more than 70 post offices in Northern Ireland would be restocked with application forms by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest.First-time applications submitted in Northern Ireland take 30 working days. Renewal applications in Britain are processed in 22 working days, while first-time applications take 45 working days. The Government has already experienced a surge in Irish passport applications since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and applications have increased as Brexit day, on March 29th, edges closer.New records were set in 2018 when the Passport Service received 855,283 passport applications. More than one-fifth came from the UK. The number of applications received from Britain increased by 22 per cent.The department has increased staff numbers at the service to prepare for the increased Brexit-related workload. The number of permanent staff at the Passport Service has increased by 20 per cent in the past 12 months and approval has been granted for 230 temporary clerical offices across the three passport offices.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May\u0026nbspfaced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbsp Many Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its Article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Spouting obscenities, eyes drifting from the road to his phone and alternative routes, he added: “On some stretches now it’s 30, then it’s 50, then 30 again. A friend of mine was caught doing 40 instead of 30 and got a penalty point.”With little notice, a new speed limit regime has been imposed on many Berlin thoroughfares. Now, someone in a rush may think their taxi driver is determined to make you miss your train. In fact he is making an enforced contribution to cleaner Berlin air – so the theory goes, at least.Like other German cities, Berlin is trying every trick it can to circumvent a court order banning older diesel vehicles from its streets. One such desperate measure is a pilot project of 30kmh speed limits around pollution black spots.It’s unlikely to satisfy the courts, or the DUH environmental lobby group. After years of fruitless battles, revelations that diesel vehicle emissions are filthier than claimed handed the DUH the proof it needed that German cities are flouting EU emissions norms imposed a decade ago.From Hamburg to Stuttgart, Germany’s cosiest of cartels – its carmakers and politicians – are struggling with a mess of their own making.But separating many Germans from their cars is like separating some Americans from their guns: something best considered by politicians with no long-term career ambitions.Officials are hamstrung by their own evidence collected from roadside measuring stations, showing city air heaving with fine diesel particulates and nitrogen dioxide well beyond EU limits. This pollution causes increased mortality by respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as exacerbating allergies, asthma, bronchitis and related infections.The European Environment Agency suggests about 500,000 European deaths annually – including 1,200 in Ireland – can be linked to this kind of pollution.German measuring stations are placed closer to the roads than in other EU countries, critics say, while Prof Köhler says the data collected is processed in a “very one-sided” fashion – “always with the goal that particulate and NOx must be harmful”.His open letter calling for a new study, cheered on by the car cartel, has confused German drivers. They are already reeling from a proposal to impose 130kmhour speed limits on Germany’s Autobahn network.That idea came from a working group exploring ways to meet 2030 climate goals, given that Germany will miss its 2020 promises. But federal transport minister Andreas Scheuer from Bavaria, home to BMW, was quick to dismiss the preliminary idea as “against any human sense”.Contradicting him was Green Party politician Cem Özdemir, joking: “In Germany I know that an idea like this is like state-imposed potency inhibitors on men.”Whatever happens in Germany’s diesel debate, it’s increasingly clear the wind has turned on the internal combustible engine.With further court rulings this year, Stuttgart and Frankfurt have banned older, Euro-4 diesels from their city centres. Cologne must follow from April, Berlin from June. After seven decades of car-is-king city planning, the German capital has pushed the automobile down the food-chain. In future, city planning decisions will prioritise all other street and road users – pedestrians, cyclists, public transport – and drivers last.That could endanger Berlin street sport, popular on balmy summer evenings, when western thoroughfares are transformed into boy racer test routes.Sipping a beer on a Ku’damm terrace, you can be sure to catch 20-something men roaring past in Maseratis and Porsches, without a police car in sight. But whenever the weather warms up again, it’ll be interesting to see how they fare at 30kmh."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3775259.1548799432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british mps back vow by may to seek border backstop changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May said she would seek legally binding changes to the Brexit withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the border backstop. Photograph: ReutersThe Conservative benches welcomed the defeat of Yvette Cooper’s amendment, which would have allowed MPs to postpone Brexit rather than leave without a deal, with a loud, satisfied growl. But when MPs voted to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal on condition that the backstop was replaced, the cheer that went up sounded more like relief than of triumph.“A fortnight ago, this House clearly rejected the proposed withdrawal agreement and political declaration with just 202 members voting in favour. Tonight a majority of honourable members have said they would support a deal with changes to the backstop,” Mrs May said.“We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the House’s views.”Twenty-four hours earlier, the prime minister appeared to be on the verge of another humiliation after Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) said they could not back an amendment tabled by 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady. They complained that the amendment’s call for the backstop to be replaced by “alternative measures” to ensure an open Border was too vague.Overnight, a group of leading Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers produced their own proposal to replace the backstop with technological customs solutions and tariff-free trade. Under the proposal, dubbed the Malthouse compromise after junior minister Kit Malthouse who hosted the talks, Britain would pay the £39 billion orce bill in full and extend the transition period to three years.The European Union had rejected almost every element in the proposal but it was soon clear that it had the support of almost all Conservative MPs and the DUP. When the prime minister promised to seek changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement itself, something the EU has consistently ruled out, the DUP and the ERG agreed to back the Brady amendment.“She can be assured of our support in trying to find a solution that avoids any hard border on the island of Ireland as well as any borders within the United Kingdom, ” Nigel Dodds said.Mrs May said that when MPs rejected her Brexit deal by 230 votes two weeks ago, they had told the world what they did not want. Now they had a chance to say what they did want and to send her back to Brussels with a mandate to renegotiate the backstop.“I will never stop battling for Britain, but the odds of success become far longer if this House ties one hand behind my back. I call on the House to give me the mandate I need to deliver a deal this House can support. Do that, and I can work to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Do that, and I can fight for a backstop that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland in a way this House can support. Do that, and we can leave the EU with a deal that honours the result of the referendum,” she said.Independent unionist Sylvia Hermon expressed frustration at the prime minister’s refusal to describe the “alternative measures” she envisaged to keep the Border open without the backstop.“The backstop was there to protect that peace, and I am very sorry that the prime minister has moved away from that today,” she said.The Scottish National Party’s Ian Blackford accused the prime minister of “ripping apart” the Belfast Agreement, a charge Mr Dodds condemned as “utterly reckless”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Neil HallEPALeading Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers have produced a joint proposal to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with tariff-free trade and technological measures to keep the Border open.The proposal emerged from secret negotiations between Remainers including former education secretary Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.It would oblige Theresa May to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement to include an alternative to the backstop based on Brexiteer proposals for “maximum facilitation” of customs and tariff-free trading arrangements. The United Kingdom and the European Union would not be treated as a single customs territory, as they would under the current backstop proposal.Both sides would instead agree to “specific facilitations and measures to ensure that no physical infrastructure is required in respect of movement of goods across the Irish border”. Customs formalities and inspections would “to the extent possible” be dealt with away from border crossing points.Sources in Dublin were dismissive of the plan, and said it contained no credible alternatives to the backstop.It was also claimed that the plan was merely a repackaging of a plan called “maximum facilitation”, which largely relied on technology to keep the Irish Border open and which was dismissed very early in the Brexit process.Under the proposal, dubbed the Malthouse compromise after Conservative MP Kit Malthouse who hosted the talks, would see Britain pay the £39 billion (€44 billion) orce bill in full and extend the transition period to three years.The second part of the proposal outlines the terms of a “managed no-deal” if Britain and the EU fail to agree a comprehensive trade deal within three years.“The first part of it is to recast the backstop as a sort of free-trade-agreement-lite. That would involve a commitment by all sides to have no hard border on the island of Ireland but allow trade to continue, while there is a slightly longer implementation period till December 2021,” Ms Morgan said.DUP leader Arlene Foster gave her party’s support to the Malthouse compromise. “We believe it can unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of Remainers and Leavers,” she said.“It also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union which would split the United Kingdom or keep the entire United Kingdom in the customs union and single market. Importantly, this proposal would also offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.”The DUP leader said: “There is no better time to advance this alternative given the confusion and disarray which is now manifesting itself in Brussels. This has been displayed both by the contradictory EU statements and the panic-stricken behaviour of the Irish Government.”However, senior EU diplomatic sources dismissed the proposal as “fanciful” and “desperate”, predicting EU leaders would reject it immediately if Mrs May were to present it for negotiation in Brussels.Mrs May has told Conservative MPs that she will seek to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border.The British prime minister urged them to vote on Tuesday for an amendment calling for her Brexit deal to be approved on condition that the backstop is replaced.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has urged Conservative MPs to give Mrs May a “strong mandate” to return to Brussels to negotiate changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop.Ahead of the Commons votes that could help shape the next phase of talks with the EU, Mr Fox said the Mrs May was ready to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to secure a legally binding text.At a meeting of Tory MPs in Westminster on Monday, Mrs May called on them to get behind an amendment tabled by influential chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady calling for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.Conservative MPs were informed they would be whipped to vote for the amendment – assuming it is selected by Commons speaker John Bercow.Her hopes of gaining a Commons majority for the plan received an initial setback after Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), said they were not prepared to support it and it did not change anything.However, Mr Rees-Mogg suggested he could be prepared to support it if the amendment had official government backing.Both the EU and the Irish government have been adamant that there can be no question of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee, said: “There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.”In Dublin, the Cabinet was scheduled to discuss further preparations for a no-deal Brexit this morning when Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe was expected to present a memo on its implications.Mr Donohoe and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have ruled out an emergency budget in the event of a no-deal outcome, insisting that the October budget was drawn up with Brexit in mind.But the Central Bank warned last week that a no-deal Brexit would deliver a serious blow to the Irish economy, slashing projected economic growth this year. Sources said that they expected the Finance memos to be similar to the Central Bank expectations. – Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But the vote in favour of Graham Brady’s amendment has changed a great deal, uniting the Conservative party over Brexit and identifying the Northern Ireland backstop as the sole obstacle in the way of ratifying the withdrawal agreement.A day earlier, the prime minister’s insistence on seeking a majority for her Brexit deal on the basis of Conservative and DUP votes appeared doomed. And a cross-party majority opposed to a no-deal Brexit seemed poised to assert itself by taking control of the parliamentary agenda so that MPs could force the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating deadline.Yvette Cooper’s amendment to allow such a course of action was the most dangerous for the prime minister, not least because it encouraged the view in EU capitals a majority could be found for a softer Brexit. But May told MPs if she had not completed the renegotiation of her deal by February 13th, she would introduce an amendable motion that would be debated the following day.This persuaded enough Conservative waverers that they would have another opportunity to block a no-deal Brexit. And Labour MPs who were queasy about being seen to be thwarting Brexit were able to comfort themselves by voting for another amendment which rejected a no-deal Brexit but did nothing to stop it.The isolation of a change to the backstop as the single issue that is both necessary and sufficient to unlock a majority for the withdrawal agreement will shape the next stage of negotiations between London and Brussels. Although Tusk’s statement last night reflected the current consensus among EU leaders, the mood could change as pressure to resolve the backstop issue grows.To win any concessions, May must first formulate a precise demand by identifying the “alternative measures” she wants to replace the backstop. The so-called Malthouse compromise that united some of her Remainer and Brexiteer backbenchers could become a burden to her negotiating team of Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, attorney general Geoffrey Cox and her effective deputy prime minister David Lidington. The Malthouse proposals are too outlandish and impractical to form the basis of any solution to the backstop. So as the prime minister seeks to woo her European partners, she will also have to keep a close eye on her ever watchful Brexiteer backbencher as she lets them down gently.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireTheresa May has promised to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement after MPs voted to support her Brexit deal if she secures changes to the Northern Ireland backstop. At the end of a dramatic day at Westminster, MPs endorsed the proposal by 317 votes to 301, a majority of 16.The DUP’s 10 MPs joined Conservative Brexiteers to support the amendment after Mrs May said she would seek to reopen the text of the agreement. It was a striking reversal of fortune for Mrs May, who saw her Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes two weeks ago.“We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the House’s views,” she said.“There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.”In a further boost for the PM, MPs rejected an amendment that could have postponed Brexit rather than leaving the EU without a deal. They backed another amendment that rejected a no-deal Brexit without prescribing any action to prevent it.In Dublin, the Government issued a terse statement: “The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council. It has not changed.” It said that the administration would “continue our preparations for all outcomes, including for a no-deal scenario.”But Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee expressed frustration at the House of Commons votes and Mrs May’s promise to MPs to reopen the withdrawal agreement.“It’s exasperating at this stage,” she said. “This is a deal negotiated with the UK, signed off by the UK and their prime minister. Now it looks like this evening that there’s row-back and a reneging on the commitments that have been made.” European Council President Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement “remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal”. In a statement issued on his behalf, Tusk said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.”Privately senior government sources in Dublin last night adopted a wait-and-see attitude, expecting the British government to spell out what its alternative to the backstop is, but with little expectation that it would.\u0026nbspThe Government said last night that it expected a phone call between the Taoiseach and Mrs May this morning.Earlier, the Department of Finance said the economy will grow at a much slower pace than anticipated but will not tip into recession in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Projections published by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe also show the unemployment rate could rise by 2 per cent if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Congressman Brendan Boyle introduced a resolution on Tuesday, outlining opposition to the establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.“One of the great foreign policy achievements of the twentieth century was the Good Friday Agreement (GFA). Brokered by US Special Envoy George Mitchell, and agreed to by the UK, Republic of Ireland, and leading parties in Northern Ireland, it eliminated the hard border that then existed between Northern Ireland the rest of Ireland. Now Brexit threatens this,” he said.“A hard border would eliminate the free flow of people between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which has proved fundamental to promoting peace and unity.”He continued: “We must not go backwards.”Members of the Irish-American caucus in the US Capital are watching events in London closely, and several have indicated that a return to a hard border in Ireland must be avoided at all costs.In particular, Richard Neal, the Massachusetts Congressman who was centrally involved in the Good Friday Agreement and is the co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill, has recently been appointed as head of the powerful Ways and Means committee. This committee will play a key role in overseeing any future trade agreement between Britain and the United States after Britain leaves the European Union. The promise of a bilateral trade agreement between Britain and the United States is a central plank of Britain’s post-Brexit economic policy given that British exports to the United States are worth about 100 billion pounds to the British economy.Though US president Donald Trump supports Brexit he has given mixed messages about the viability of an EU-US trade deal in recent months.In November, he said that the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU meant that the UK may not be able to trade with the United States after it leaves the European UnionDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Over the weekend Australia and Israel joined the 20-odd countries that now accept Mr Guaido as the interim president, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, told the UN security council that “the time is now” to move to oust the “illegitimate mafia state” of Mr Maduro.On Tuesday the drums got louder as the US raised the state department’s travel warning to “do not travel” – putting Venezuela in the same category as only 12 countries worldwide, among them Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia.Mr Pompeo also announced on Tuesday that Mr Guaido had full control of Venezuelan assets in US federal banks.Juan Guaido, the \u0026#34interim president\u0026#34 of VenezuelaMr Guaido is currently petitioning the Bank of England to prevent Mr Maduro getting his hands on $1.3 billion (£1 billion) in gold held in London vaults. Venezuela, which is struggling to provide basic services, has some $8 billion in foreign reserves around the world.On Monday the US placed sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company – a move designed to cripple Mr Maduro’s regime financially, and sway the military to defect.Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Vladimir Putin – one of the main backers of Mr Maduro - said the Kremlin shares the view of the Venezuelan government that the sanctions are illegal and sees them as a tool of unfair competition on part of the United States.In Venezuela, meanwhile, the attorney-general – a Maduro loyalist – slapped a travel ban on Mr Guaido and froze his assets – both seen as symbolic gestures unlikely to have a significant impact.More than a new threat against me, against this parliament, against the acting president of this republic, there\u0027s nothing new, said Mr Guaido.I\u0027m not dismissing the threats, the persecution at this time, but we\u0027re here, we\u0027re continuing to do our jobs.What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?No deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allBrexit vote result: How did your MP vote in each amendment?What next for the Brexit deal?

She also backed the ’s campaign for social media firms to be subject to a statutory duty of care to protect children.Ms Longfield’s letter comes after a father accused Instagram of “helping to kill” his 14-year-old daughter, Molly Russell, after he found she had been looking at suicide and depression images before taking her own life.Ian Russell has since called on social media companies to “stand up and take more responsibility” for what young people view on their networks.Molly Russell had been looking at suicide posts on social media before taking her own life in 2017In the wake of his comments, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has written to social media and tech companies saying he is “appalled” at how easy suicide material is to find on their sites.He also warned that Parliament could “ban” access to them if they did not act.In her letter, Ms Longfield said: “The tragic suicide of Molly Russell and her father’s appalled response to the material she was viewing on social media before her death have again highlighted the horrific amount of disturbing content that children are accessing online.“I do not think it is going too far to question whether even you, the owners (of tech companies), any longer have any control over their content.“If that is the case, then children should not be accessing your services at all, and parents should be aware that the idea of any authority overseeing algorithms and content is a mirage.”She said in recent years she had discussed with tech firms ways they could protect children but she was not convinced that they are taking the efforts seriously.“I have been reassured time and time again that this is an issue taken seriously,” said Ms Longfield.“However, I believe that there is still a failure to engage and that children remain an afterthought.”The Children’s Commissioner for England has statutory powers to protect children, including to demand data and information from public bodies.Although her powers do not extend to private companies, Ms Longfield called on social media companies to voluntarily reveal the extent of self harm material being published on their sites as well as how many children and teenagers are viewing it.Earlier this week Sir Nick Clegg, who has recently joined Instagram’s parent company Facebook as vice president of global affairs and communications, defended its approach to suicide and self harm material.He said the company had been advised not to take down all such images as a matter of course and that Facebook had save thousands of lives by highlighting users suicidal behaviour to mental health charities and authorities.Responding to the letter from the Children’s Commissioner, Facebook said: “We have a huge responsibility to make sure young people are safe on our platforms and working together with the Government, the Children\u0027s Commissioner and other companies is the only way to make sure we get this right.”Please review our commenting policyWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?No deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allBrexit vote result: How did your MP vote in each amendment?What next for the Brexit deal?

The head of the parliament, Juan Guaido, declared himself acting president\u0026nbsplast week and he has been recognised as the legitimate interim leader by a number of countries, including the United States. Britain has said it will recognise Guaido as the interim president if fresh elections are not announced shortly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what precisely does it entail for the UK?What is the World Trade Organisation?It is an inter-governmental organisation with 164 members – almost every state in the world and certainly all the major economies.Its central purpose is to permit goods and services\u0026nbspto flow across borders with relative ease.The key element of its agreements is that every member shall treat every other member equally in terms of tariff charges, meaning there shall be no arbitrary discrimination.So if country X, say, offers a lower tariff on a certain imported product to country Y it also has to automatically offer that lower tariff to every other country too. This is the “most favoured nation” principle.However, there is an exception. Where two countries enter into a free trade agreement that covers the bulk of their trade, they can offer each other lower tariffs without having to also offer them to everyone else.So the countries of the EU free trade area can charge zero tariffs on cars imported from each other but can keep the levies in place on cars imported from America.Another function of the WTO is to arbitrate disputes. So if one country accuses another of breaking the rules of the system the WTO will examine the case and decide which party is in the right.The party that is in the wrong will face sanctions and the party that is in the right is allowed to impose import restrictions.If we leave the EU would we be able to trade on WTO rules with the rest of the world?Yes. The UK is already an independent member of the WTO.To trade in its own right (outside the European Union’s customs union) we would first need to notify the rest of the membership about our proposed tariffs and quotas. Other countries in the WTO could then raise objections to these – and indeed have already done so. But this is a pretty minor obstacle.A far more important problem is that many aspects of our economic\u0026nbsprelations would not be underpinned by WTO rules.The WTO framework doesn’t cover extremely important aspects of a modern economy like the UK such as aviation, medicine export licencing, data flow and many other areas.The UK would also, incidentally, fall out of the coverage of all the free trade agreements between the EU and states such as Mexico and South Korea.This is the reason why it is misleading to talk about a “WTO deal”. The WTO is a patchy, minimum framework not any kind of substitute for a comprehensive free trade agreement such as we have had with the EU.But doesn’t most of the world trade perfectly happily on basic WTO rules?No. This is a fallacy. Even if countries are not in comprehensive free trade agreements, almost all have bilateral agreements with other states on top of their WTO relationship.Do the WTO rules say that if we agree with the EU to pursue a free trade deal we can keep tariffs at zero until it’s ready?Another fallacy. This claim seems to be a reference to Article XXIV of the WTO rules.But trade experts say this covers the circumstances of two countries forming a new trade agreement, not of them leaving one. And they insist that those who cite it as a reason why nothing has to change on trade after Brexit are labouring under a gross\u0026nbspmisunderstanding\u0026nbspof the rule.“The idea that Article XXIV...somehow obliges the EU to continue providing the full benefits of the single market for the next ten years, or even allows the UK to unilaterally offer the EU (and no one else) market access is preposterous,” says\u0026nbspDmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator.In any case the overriding concern of industry resulting from a no-deal Brexit is not actually tariffs but the negative impact of border checks resulting from leaving the EU’s customs union and single market.Do WTO rules compel the EU not to impose trade frictions on the UK?Yet another fallacy. Some have argued that the WTO “commits members to facilitate trade”, implying the EU would be breaking the law if it imposed\u0026nbspany new border restrictions or tariffs after a no-deal Brexit, including on the Irish border.But analysts say that, however onerous they are, tariffs and border checks are perfectly compatible with this WTO “facilitate trade” requirement.“Both the UK and the EU already comply with this agreement, meaning any procedures they introduce on imports from each other will also comply, as long as the criteria are the same as for imports from, say, the US, China or India,” says\u0026nbspPeter Ungphakorn, formerly of the WTO Secretariat.As for EU tariffs, the opposite is the case. If the EU did not impose its common external tariff\u0026nbspon the UK after a no-deal Brexit it would be breaking WTO rules by favouring a state with which it didn’t have a free trade deal.So is the WTO really any use at all?“The WTO is not useless. Its rules are an essential part of the architecture for a peaceful and prosperous world,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.“But they are lowest common denominator rules for trade between 164 separate and sometimes mutually hostile states, not the rules for deeply integrated, highly cooperative, sophisticated allies.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She subsequently argued that teachers should not be expected to answer emails or spend hours marking schoolwork after 5pm each day.Morgan also announced plans to launch a new website to make it easier for women to identify potential job-sharing partners.Three years on and not much appears to have changed. Just last week, Hinds said teachers should not be spending their evenings and weekends responding to emails. The minister also revealed proposals to give more support to teachers who want to work part-time and share jobs.If the rhetoric has remained the same since 2014, despite three different education secretaries, at least\u0026nbspnow the government has announced plans to provide more funding to improve retention.Teachers at the start of their career – who are often those who need the most support –\u0026nbspwill be given a training package and a reduced timetable, backed by at least £130m a year, under the proposals. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

Sara wants to be able to contribute to a society by becoming a doctor to help othersAnd some new teachers in England could be given an additional £5,000 in their third and fifth years in the classroom in a bid to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis within the profession.The move has been broadly welcomed across the sector. But for the strategy to be effective, headteachers must be on board. They are in charge of school workload polices.And let’s not forget that more than 50 per cent of children in state schools in England are now taught in an academy. And these schools have many more freedoms to decide how they will manage their staff.It will take a lot more to change the culture in schools. Marking and planning lessons late into the evening and at the weekends is normal for many teachers. And headteachers who fear bad exam results, or a poor Ofsted inspection result, may be reluctant to take a more relaxed approach.Meanwhile, funding pressures will inevitably increase the pressures on staff as they struggle to keep the same provision in place with fewer teachers and resources.The extra cash and resources to reduce workload and normalise part-time work is welcome. But I would not be surprised if we hear similar ministerial rhetoric and pledges in years to come. There appears to be no magic bullet to poor work-life balance and shortages within the profession.Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you are using Apple\u0027s Continuity features and have FaceTime enabled on other iPads or Macs, then those computers will also be affected – and so the only way to be entirely sure is to turn that off anywhere you are worried about being listened to.Apple turns off feature that let people be snooped on through iPhonesSuch an approach is relatively easy, though of course extreme: it means that phone calls won\u0027t work at all through FaceTime, whether they are video or just audio and even if they are not group chats.It will be important to turn the feature back on when the update arrives and the problem is fixed, if you rely on FaceTime. That\u0027s done in exactly the same way.The bug appears to have arrived when Apple recently added group FaceTime through an iOS and macOS update. The conference calling feature appears to have introduced the problem, meaning that any phone with the iPhone\u0027s latest updates will be affected.The feature had already been delayed, having been shown off at the launch of iOS 12 but not made available until later in the year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

European Council president Donald Tusk’s spokesman said “the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation”, and the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator,\u0026nbspGuy Verhofstadt, said\u0026nbspthere was “no majority to reopen or dilute” the deal.Downing Street aides admitted the task ahead looked difficult, but highlighted that the previous deal had been heavily defeated and that the Commons had shown what needed to happen for the deal to pass.If Ms May does secure any changes to the deal she will put it to another “meanignful vote”.\u0026nbspIf she does\u0026nbspnot then she must return to the Commons by 13 February to give\u0026nbspMPs another chance to propose alternative measures.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But that is it.The international trade secretary Liam Fox is doing the media rounds this morning and has called for Brexiteers to support an amendment that has been put forward by Sir Graham Brady.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe has said the UK is willing to reopen the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspFormer Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan has confirmed talks have been taking place for some days between MPs from the Remain and Leave wings of the Tory Party, co-ordinated by MP Kit Malthouse, to find a compromise way forward.The discussions involved herself, Health Minister Stephen Hammond, and Solicitor General Robert Buckland from one wing of the party, and Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from the Brexiteer side.\u0026nbspSpeaking on\u0026nbspthe BBC Radio 4 Today programme she said their plan involved a recasting of the Northern Ireland backstop as free trade agreement-lite with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland and an extended transition period to December 2021.Nicky Morgan this morning:The Prime Minister has been aware of the discussions. At some point there has to be compromise on all sides in order to get a deal over the line. That is what most of us want to see - a negotiated settlement with the EU\u0026nbspPeople like me want to avoid a no-deal outcome, a crashing out on March 29. We have to look for ways to do that. We are all prepared to compromise on that.A new Brexit plan, which is reportedly backed by both the Remain and Leave camps of the Conservative party, has also been put forward.\u0026nbspThe plan - dubbed the Malthouse Compromise - would lead to Britain leaving the EU on time and with a functioning government, former Brexit minster Steve Baker\u0026nbspsaid.The proposal provides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said support for Sir Graham Brady\u0027s amendment would enable Theresa May to return to Brussels with a strong mandate to seek changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.He said the Prime Minister was prepared, if necessary, to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement in order to secure a legally-binding text,\u0026nbsphe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.I think we should send the Prime Minister back to Brussels with a strong mandate to be able to say \u0027If you compromise with us on this one issue, on the the backstop, we would be able to a get an agreement\u0027 - an agreement that is almost there.We have seen the German economy weakening, we have seen the French economy weakening.I think this view - \u0027We can simply weather out any disturbance that would occur from a no-deal\u0027 - I think there is much less appetite for that. I think we still have time to reach a compromise on that.Here\u0027s the latest from our Deputy Political Editor Rob Merrick, who brings news of a Brexit plan C that has emerged after Jacob Rees-Mogg has joined forces with Tory Remainers:\u0026nbspSo what are the key amendments being tabled by MPs?Brake on the backstopTheresa May threw Government support on Monday behind an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspthat seeks to replace the controversial backstop with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Tabled by Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, if it passed the Commons its supporters believe it gives Mrs May more firepower to go back to Brussels and ask for more concessions and get a Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.Fellow Tories Andrew Murrison and John Baron scrapped very similar\u0026nbspamendments to clear a path, but the hardline ERG is refusing to back it.Grieve\u0026nbspamendmentIn a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the cross-party backed proposal from Dominic Grieve would effectively wrest control of Commons business from the Government for six inidual days in the run-up to the UK\u0027s scheduled withdrawal date of 29 March with the intention of getting MPs to reach a consensus on how to handle it.Taking controlIn a similar vein, a move by Labour former minister Yvette Cooper, supported by Tories such as Nick Boles, calls for a vote on a Bill that would give Parliament control over the Brexit process if Theresa May fails to secure a deal by February 26.MPs would get a vote on extending Article 50 to the end of the year and preventing a no-deal exit under the terms of the Bill. The Labour frontbench has been publicly flirting with throwing its weight behind the\u0026nbspamendment.No to no dealA cross-party effort headed by Tory Dame Caroline Spelman has widespread support and rejects the UK quitting the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement. This would probably be more palatable to the Government than either the Grieve or Cooper bids for MPs to take back control.Labour\u0027s twin track approachThis calls for MPs to be able to vote on options to stop a no-deal exit, such as a customs union with the EU, as well as the possibility of a new Brexit referendum. Jeremy Corbyn has been careful not to commit Labour to officially back such a poll, though.Amendments have been tacked on to the Labour push, with the Liberal Democrats calling for Remain to be on the ballot paper in any referendum, and Labour backbenchers urging Parliament to legislate for a public vote.Indicative votesCommons Exiting the European Union Committee chairman Hilary Benn wants a series of votes on various Brexit options to see where the most support lies.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightBecause of its flexibility, it could also be fabricated to cover large areas.This has major implications for the future of electronic intelligence, say the scientists.Professor Tomas Palacios, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsystems Technology Laboratories Centre for Graphene Devices and 2D Systems, said: What if we could develop electronic systems that we wrap around a bridge or cover an entire highway, or the walls of our office and bring electronic intelligence to everything around us? How do you provide energy for those electronics?We have come up with a new way to power the electronics systems of the future - by harvesting wi-fi energy in a way that\u0027s easily integrated in large areas - to bring intelligence to every object around us.In experiments, the rectenna generated about 40 microwatts of power when exposed to typical wi-fi signals of around 150 microwatts.That is more than enough to light up a simple mobile display or activate silicon chips.The research is published in the latest online issue of the journal Nature.Spanish co-author Professor Jesus Grajal, from the Technical University of Madrid, said a key application could be in the field of medical implants and pills that stream health data after being swallowed by patients.He added: Ideally you don\u0027t want to use batteries to power these systems, because if they leak lithium, the patient could die.To create the rectenna, the team used a novel 2D material called molybdenum disulphide, which at three atoms thick is one of the world\u0027s thinnest semiconductors.All antennas produce electricity, but normally in very tiny amounts.In a portable radio, for instance, an amplifier boosts the signal to allow broadcasts to be heard.The amplifier needs a suitable power source, such as a battery.The electricity obtained from radio waves comes in the form of a high-frequency alternating current (AC).In the new device, the semiconductor converts the AC signal into a more usable direct current.The scientists are now planning more complex devices with improved efficiency.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of Mr Puigdemont’s former regional cabinet are now being prosecuted for their involvment\u0026nbspin the failed bid.Adressing an auidence\u0026nbspat Trinity College about the current political situation, Mr Puigdemont said: “The Catalonia proposal is profoundly pro-European. First of all it was the Catalan people who chose to become a new fully fledged state in the EU under the rules of the European Union.Catalonia independence referendum one year on, how do things look now?“Indeed, Catalonia in general has a clear desire to be part of European project as we feel profoundly involved.“We firmly believe in the common European project and we are convinced that we have a future together. Our country, history and culture make us more stronger and more prosperous.\u0026nbspCatalan people hope and trust that the political conflict of our nation can be resolved peacefully without war, without violence or without winners and losers. We reject all the violence used in the last century to resolve political conflicts.”Spain’s supreme court dropped its international arrest warrants for Mr Puigdemont in July last year.

The aim was to make people give up their right to vote. People overcame fear and went out to vote. We know many tried to do so unsuccessfully.”He said that he and his former colleagues have been accused of crimes of rebellion and are facing prison sentences of up to 25 years.“No violence action has been carried by the people who are being prosecuted,” he added.Mr Puigdemont held a private meeting with Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Republic of Ireland. He would not, however, be drawn on whether he would support Ms McDonald’s call for a poll on the question of the Irish border following Brexit.He said: “I want to remain very respectful considering the internal domestic decisions. It’s not my duty or goal to talk about the Irish and UK relationship or what happens if there is a hard Brexit or no-deal.“I have my personal opinion but I insist we must, as Catalan people, respect the decision of the UK and Ireland.

The planes will fly, the ferries will ply.He was mocked when he tried to distance himself from controversial adverts about immigration from Turkey during the  campaign.Vote Leave adverts posted widely on social media stated that Turkeyis joining the EU and Britains new border is with Syria and Iraq. Some included maps with large red arrows pointing towards the UK.But Mr Johnsonclaimed: I didnt say anything about Turkey in the referendum ...since I made no remarks, I cant disown them.The Home Secretary is the current bookies favourite among the Conservatives.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Some of his statements in recent months and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.The former Brexit secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.Raab has insisted no deal wouldnt be chaotic for Britain and said the short-term risks were manageable.He has blasted those who want to extend Article  or a second referendum.He said: If theres an attempt to reverse the referendum, stop Brexit altogether I think that would cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history we had.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS, but was hated by junior doctors after changing their contacts so they wouldnt receive extra pay for the many shts they work previously classied as unsociable hours.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.Ms Rudd has managed to stay in favour with Mrs May, taking the buck for the Windrush scandal and stepping down as Home Secretary - before months later ing to the cabinet and Work and Pensions chief in November.The -year-old Hastings MP has voiced support for the PM and for her botched Brexit deal, but insiders think shes savvy enough to manoeuvre a bid to the top when shes ready.One concern though would be her slim majority in her constituency of Hastings and Rye, which was slimmed down after the  vote to just  votes.In contrast, Mrs May enjoys a , majority in her constituency of Maidenhead, that has stood behind her over more than two decades.She warned the PM there could be dozens of resignationsTory MPs are banned from voting for a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has won a huge public profile despite not being a minister and is adored by hard-line Tory activists.Rees-Mogg has also garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, such as being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.David Davis quit as Brexit secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories have demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004126109303.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit vote commons theresa may dominic grieve","story":"Theresa Mays last-minute talks with MPs on both sides paid off with a tight victory as Tory rebels backed down at the th hour. Heres what you need to know about the vote.The Government defeated an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve over a meaningful vote for MPs on the final Brexit Deal.In a tight vote, the Commons opposed the Lords final amendments  votes to , giving them a majority of .The result means that the EU Withdrawal Bill can finally become law almost a year after it was first tabled.The legislation is key to making Brexit happen, as it will repeal the European Communities Act  - the law that brought us into the EU - and incorporate European regulations into British law.Theres a fraught background to the bill, which has been discussed heatedly over the past six months.Last week the Commons voted on the  Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill.The final point of contention was how much control Parliament should have over the Brexit process.MPs had been weighing up two amendments over the remaining sticking point over the meaningful vote - to decide which one to add to the bill before it passes completely.The replacement amendment stated thatthe UK and Europe cant strike a successful deal, Parliament will get a debate and vote where MPs can express their views on the next step.But rebels didnt think it went far enough - and so Dominic Grieve wrote his own version.This would have allowed MPs not only to vote on a No Deal scenario, but to amend the motion in order deliver a more specic message to the Government.However, the rebel ringeader announced he would switch sides and back the Government after being told Parliament COULD get a say on what ministers dotalks with Brussels break down.Grieve said he was abandoning his revolt in response to an admission by ministers thatthey fail to strike a Brexit deal with the EU, Parliament may get the chance to tell the Government what to do next.David Davis issued a statement saying it will be up to the Commons Speaker John Bercow to rule on whether MPs can give specic instructions to ministers in the event of No Deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004409297771.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may customs union tory dup backstop","story":"The PM’s stand comes as her pact with her Northern Irish allies hung by a thread after extraordinary revelations DUP chiefs want her gone by Christmas and deputy leader Nigel Dodds mocked Tory panic.And in fresh headache for Mrs May it was also emerged last night the EU are secretly discussing extending the Brexit process because of the chaos.Her tough words came in a bid to quell the revolt over the so called Brexit backstop - which Brexiteers insist must have “get out clause” written into it. The “backstop” would see Britain mirror EU rules indefinitelyno new trade deal is in place to keep the Northern Irish border open.The EU now suggests a longer post-Brexit transition until December , citing lack of progress. It would see us paying Brussels billions extra.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted that it must be “time-limited” and cannot leave Britain “in definite limbo”.However he stopped short of demanding a named date as Brussels has rejected this and Downing Street said his stance was consistent with the PM.No said the PM would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.” But Ireland said having an open ended backstop was “a deal-breaker” for them.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said: “The backstop needs to be there unless and until something better comes along. Nobody wants to use the backstop - this is like taking out fire insurance on your house.”But yesterday Philip Hammond explicitly stated the temporary period would be needed to be invoked.Mrs May has always insisted the backstop is unlikely to ever be needed, yet Mr Hammond said: “It is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership.Mrs May now heads to Brussels on Wednesday to meet fellow EU leaders for a crunch summit that faces deadlock.Meanwhile open civil war broke out between Tory MPs and their crucial DUP allies over the issue, after the Northern Irish threatened to dethrone the PM.And as Sun columnist James Forsyth reveals today, some senior figures in the DUP want the PM to be ousted within weeks.Tory MP Nick Boles hit out: “Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party. And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.And it emerged Eurocrats are mulling plans to prolong the transition period in a bid to stop the DUP torpedoing a Brexit deal.Sources said the withdrawal pact could be changed so the  month window can be extended to reassure Unionists the backstop will never be needed.The EU is making a demand of Theresa May she cannot fulfil without national humiliation, mass Cabinet resignations and near-certain Commons defeat.Brussels must know it is utterly unreasonable to demand we stay locked in their customs union indefinitely. Or that they should dictate when we can finally leave. Which they never would.A .million majority voted to leave. MPs voted that meant leaving the customs union. Our democracy, sovereignty and trading future are all at stake. Mrs May must defend all three. God knows what happens next weekshe doesn’t.The Remain ultras should be loving this chaos. Except they have suffered their own disaster. The EU sayswe held a second referendum and voted Remain, they’d strip us of our historic rebate on payments to Brussels.So along with violent unrest, a ­collapse of trust in democracy and a huge surge in extremism, Remaining would come with a whole new price tag on top of EU membership fees: Four thousand million quid a year.Good luck selling that.But the plot will enrage Brexiteers, who fear efforts to trap Britain permanently in the Single Market and Customs Union as a vassal state.During a transition the UK will be banned from striking trade deals and will have to keep making budget payments, while following EU rules without any say.Sources said Michel Barnier is considering a new plan that would see the transition stay in place until the end of  - meaning a two year, nine month phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.“But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via a driveway on the side.“It means that people don’t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.“Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.“I am hoping that perhaps it might appeal to someone from outside the area.”Mr Dutton said the chapel had been bought and turned into a high-quality home with “a wonderful light-filled interior” by a local developer.The developer originally planned to live there before changing his mind and putting it on the market as he wanted to move nearer his childrens’ schools.It was originally up for sale at £, with a dferent agent before it was taken on by Bedfords, who cut the price to £, before cutting it again.Mr Dutton believes the house, which has a new roof and windows, is worth at least £, more than its price tag due to the quality of the conversion.He said: “It just seems buyers are put off which is such a shame as the cost of the conversion far outweighs the price it’s for sale for.“Someone is going to get a real bargain.

But Glengorm is in the Central North Sea and this find shows there is still le in some of the more mature UK waters.The Oil and Gas Authority branded the discovery “very exciting news”.And Andy Samuel, chief executive of the regulator, said there is every chance of yet more signicant finds”.But environmental groups have slammed the find, saying the venture will contribute to climate change.They want energy firms to leave oil and gas in the ground and use renewable resources.Caroline Rance, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: Its a disgrace that oil and gas exploration is still going ahead in the seas off Scotland.Its high time our governments stopped supporting fossil fuel development, and get serious about planning a just transition away from this industry.Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the announcement, highlights the signicant potential for oil and gas which still exists beneath Scotlands waters.He added: Scotlands offshore oil and gas industry has an important role to play with up to  billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining under the North Sea and in the wider basin and discoveries such as this help to support security of supply as we make the transition to a low carbon energy system."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000365817587.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"penny mordaunt foreign aid target","story":"She delivered a presentation to Cabinet colleagues on a detailed plan to tweak rules that would slash the amount taxpayers contribute to the bloated £ billion a year budget.Ms Mordaunt told weekly meeting - chaired by the Prime Minister - that the Government could then use the savings to boost NHS spending and “other domestic priorities”.Cabinet ministers also backed moves to use the foreign aid budget to support Britain’s Armed Forces and humanitarian missions.The strict rules by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committeemean millions of pounds of aid spending do not count towards the . per cent of national income target.Hundreds of millions of our aid spending is spent through private firms - such as the CDC Group.These contractors make profits, which are then invested back into foreign aid projects, but the rules bar these profits from being counted towards the . per cent target.Ms Mordaunt said changing the rules to allow this reinvested profit to count towards the target would free up millions of pounds for other departments by shaving the bloated aid budget.She said this would also allow her Department for International Developmentto “move from being a spending department to a fundraising department”.Ms Mordaunt told Cabinet that the . per cent “in its current form is unsustainable” but changing rules would help the foreign aid obligations become “less reliant” on the public purse.She launched a new consultation with charities, financial services, investors and the public about how to allocate more private money towards the foreign aid target.Ms Mordaunt said the review will also look into how money invested in saving and pension funds could deliver more s for UK investors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest on Britains departure from the EU.Brexit comes from merging the words Britain and exit.The term has been widely used ever since the idea of a referendum on leaving the EU was put forward.More than million people voted in the June  referendum with a turnout of . per cent. Leave won by  per cent to  per cent.People now talk about “soft” and “hard” Brexit in reference to how close the UK will be to the EU post separation.The road to triggering Article  — which saw Britain officially start the process of leaving the EU — was paved with complications for the PM, including a Supreme Court case ruling MPs needed to vote on Brexit negotiations.But it was finally triggered on March , , meaning the official departure date and move into the transition phase is due to take place on March , .The European Union is an economic and political partnership. There are currently  members states including the United Kingdom.It began as a trade group of six nations in the s.The UK first applied to join what was then the European Economic Community in  and finally became a member in .Now called the European Union, it has grown to include former Soviet bloc states and has at its heart a “single market” allowing goods and people to move freely.It has its own parliament, central bank and the euro currency used by  countries, with some members including Britain opting to keep their own money.Eurocrats have been pushing for ever closer political and financial union, which could include a European Army separate from the Nato alliance.Those in favour of leaving said Britain was being held back by EU red tape with too many rules on business.They also campaigned on the issue of sovereignty and said they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders.Beyond the question of ceasing to be a member of the EU, what Brexit actually means in practice has been the subject of intense debate ever since.Theresa May officially triggered Article  on March ,  after which there was a two-year time limit set for negotiations to hammer out the details.The UK is therefore bound to leave the EU by March , , although there is a -month transition period.Negotiations began on June , with the two chief negotiators, Michel Barnier of the EU and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, immediately setting off to find common ground.Some of the “uncertainties” being discussed include citizens living in each others territory, border arrangements between Ireland and the UK and the amount Britain stands to pay to honour its existing EU commitments.This is a bridging agreement between the current situation – where we are members of the EU – and our long-term relationship outside the bloc.Also known as an implementation phase, it allows for the UK to keep some of the same arrangements with Brussels on trade and other matters until a new comprehensive trade agreement is sealed.In March , Britain secured a transition deal that will also allow ministers to seek trade agreements around the globe.The UK will also be free to set its own foreign policy as soon as Brexit happens, as well as negotiate and sign new trade deals anywhere in the world – to implement them in .However EU chiefs made it clear the period, which allows the UK to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, will only come into forcethe Irish border is sorted.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled terms for the  month interim period.The UK will not be fully out of the EU until December ,  – four and a half years after the historic referendum decision.But EU leaders have suggested they could extend the transition period further.Theresa May finally struck a Brexit deal with Brussels on November ,, after days of round-the-clock talks in Brussels.But this has proved just the beginning of a long drawn-out, painful process.Facing near certain defeat by Parliament, which is required to back the deal, Mrs May cancelled the meaningful vote on December .The opposition centred predominantly on the backstop agreement which ensures there is never a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.May is set to go back to the EU and demand it ditches the hated Northern Ireland backstop in a last ditch plan to save Brexit.It came after the UK parliament backed an amendment instructing the Prime Minister to demand that Brussels replace the backstop — which aims to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit  — with alternative arrangements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004633896091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what is brexit deal and what happens next","story":"We explain what Theresa Mays Brexit deal is and what will happen next.The PM presented her first Brexit deal after getting the backing of the EU at the end of November.Many MPs on both sides of the aisle had slammed the Withdrawal Agreement when it was first presented in the House of Commons.Key points of that deal included:May scrapped the meaningful vote on her deal in the th hour in December.

She then survived a second vote of no confidence in her government by  votes.Mrs May was hellbent on protecting her deal - but its unclear that MPs or EU leaders will budge.These are words she has used time and time again - it remains to be seen whether she can make her vision a reality.On January  she presented plan B of her Brexit deal in House of Commons.She reaffirmed her view that Britain was going to leave the EU and she opposed a second referendum.She told MPs: Our duty is to implement the decision of the first one.I fear a second referendum would set a dficult precedent that could have signicant implications for how we handle referendums in this country.During a vote on January , the UK parliament backed an amendment instructing May to demand that Brussels replace the backstop — which aims to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit  — with alternative arrangements.But the EU signalled they were not willing to budge.Not least, strengthening the hand of those campaigning to break up our United Kingdom.It would require an extension of Article .

We will consider what amendments will be neededat that point no progress has been made.We remain committed to ensuring that we don’t reach the clf edge on  March without a deal.”Crestfallen Remainer Chuka Umunna said he was deeply disappointed by the losses tonight and said Parliament had been robbed of the chance to stop Brexit.And Lib Dem Layla Moran tore into Labour MPs for abstaining, some of them not even bothering to voting at all.Shame on those members who sat on their hands on the Cooper amendment, she blasted.One MP said that Mr Corbyns dire speech earlier was a key factor in keeping Labour MPs away.But another said that chaos last night over a separate Brexit bill on immigration put them off, saying: Im not risking my seathe cant get his act together.Mr Corbyns own plan for a delay to Brexit and seeking a customs union with the bloc was slapped down resolutely by MPs tonight too.And another plot by chief Remainer Dominic Grieve to give MPs control of the Commons timetable to debate Brexit was also defeated - by  - .Tonight MPs voted to tell Mrs May to go back to Brussels and rip out the hated Northern Ireland backstop - and they COULD get behind her deal.They backed a change by Sir Graham Brady which pushed for alternative arrangements to be secured instead.The law states that after the deals defeat, the PM must make a statement in the Commons announcing her plans - which she did last Monday, saying she would press on with her current deal.The Government must then table a so-called neutral motion to be voted on - stating simply that the House of Commons has considered the statement made by the PM.Why does the vote matter Whether or not MPs vote in favour of the motion tabled by Mrs May is literally meaningless.But crucially, the motion can be amended - giving the Commons the right to pass any resolution it wants and dictate to the Government what it should do next.What are the amendments There are two main amendments - one from Labours Yvette Cooper which rules out a No Deal Brexit, and another from top Tory Graham Brady which kills off the Irish backstop.But another five amendments from across the political spectrum were also selected for a vote by Speaker John Bercow.Most of the amendments arent legally binding but would provide a clear political message to the Government.But the Cooper amendment is legally binding - making it more worrying to ministers than the others.So what next Tonight’s vote is not a rerun of the first meaningful vote on whether or not to approve the Brexit deal.That is likely to come some time in February - whatever happens this evening.The Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum has publicly supported the move as the first step towards cancelling Brexit altogether.A number of Tory Remainers are expected to vote for the Cooper amendment rather than risk No Deal.Today Business Minister Richard Harrington issued an extraordinary public warning to the PM not to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.He told the BBC: Many of us have been to see the Prime Minister and have told her the absolute catastrophe and disaster for jobs and the economy that No Deal would be.What she has asked us is that we give her another two weeks.Mr Harrington said he would quit as a ministerthe PM refused to give MPs another chance to rule out No Deal within a fortnight.Mrs May is pinning her hopes on a rival amendment from Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady.That motion would declare that the Commons supports the PMs deal as long as the Irish backstop is removed.A TOTAL of  dferent amendments were tabled to today’s Brexit motion - and Speaker John Bercow selected seven to go for a vote.COOPER AMENDMENT - DELAY BREXIT Labours Yvette Cooper has teamed up with Tory ex-minister Nick Boles to try to take No Deal off the table.The cross-party amendment would force the Government to introduce a bill giving unprecedented powers to MPs.The House of Commons would have been able to vote to delay Brexit by up to nine monthsBritain is heading towards a No Deal outcome.The bill states thatthere is no deal in place by February , MPs could then instruct the Government to seek an extension of Article , the legal mechanism taking us out of the EU.Jeremy Corbyn backed the amendment today - which gave it a good chance of success - but ultimately it failed when some of his own MPs abandoned him.BRADY AMENDMENT - DROP THE BACKSTOP Sir Graham Brady is one of a group of senior Brexiteers whove tabled an amendment to kill off the Irish backstop.The amendment states that the Commons is prepared to back Theresa Mays deal, but only on condition the backstop is replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border.Although it wouldnt be binding, Sir Graham says thatit passes it would allow the PM toto Brussels and secure changes to the withdrawal agreement.The Government is supporting the amendment and will tell Tory MPs they must vote for it.GRIEVE AMENDMENT - SEIZING CONTROL Dominic Grieve, the Tory Remainer with a history of tabling wrecking amendments, wants MPs to grab control of the Commons agenda.The Government would have mean the Government lose the power to determine the order of business on six specic days in February and March.Its thought anti-Brexit MPs would have take the opportunity to table legislation which could delay or even scrap our EU departure.SPELMAN AMENDMENT - RULE OUT NO DEAL  The amendment with the most cross-party support was drawn up by senior Tory Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey.It states that the Commons rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement - but its not legally binding.REEVES AMENDMENT - KEEP US IN Labour MP Rachel Reevess amendment is similar to Yvette Coopers, but is not binding on the Government.It states thatno deal has been reached by February , the Government should ask Brussels to extend the Article  process.This one didnt pass.LABOUR AMENDMENT - FUDGE Jeremy Corbyn tabled an amendment calling for a string of additional votes on what should happen next.The options mentioned include delaying Brexit, staying in a customs union or holding a second referendum.SNP AMENDMENT - LISTEN TO SCOTLAND SNP boss Ian Blackford has proposed a motion concluding thatthe people of Scotland should not be taken out of the EU against their will.The PMs spokesman said: In order to win the support of the House of Commons, legal changes to the backstop will be required. That will mean reopening the withdrawal agreement.The Prime Minister also reiterated that today will not be the last chance for Parliament to express a view on the Brexit process.If we have not brought back a revised deal by February ,  we will make a statement and again table an amendable motion for debate the next day.

My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the house’s views.As I said this afternoon, there is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy.But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this house has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.Now MPs have signalled they want “alternative arrangements” to the hated Northern Ireland backstop, then she can tell the EU thatthey make the change, Parliament is almost certain to sign it off in the coming weeks.Mrs May will speak to EU leaders today and the rest of the week - and could dash to Brussels for emergency talks too to thrash out a compromise.Jean-Claude Juncker has already ruled it out, but the PM could go around him to talk to the heads of the other EU states.If they manage to get a change, she will then give MPs another vote on her deal within weeks.If not, the PM will probably tell her MPs it’s her deal or nothing, having fought with the EU as much as possible but to no avail.MPs who fear crashing out could then turn around at the last minute and back the deal.Responding, Jeremy Corbyn agreed for the first time to attend talks on Brexit at  Downing Street.He said: The Prime Minister must now face the reality that No Deal is not an option. I will meet the Prime Minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country.Boris Johnson hailed the PMs victory, saying the result was “clear unambiguous good news” and a “huge victory for Britain”.The Tory big hitter said: “The PM now has a mandate from Parliament that the backstop, the thing that keeps us locked in the single market, the customs union, has to come out.“Parliament has very clearly said there has to be a change. I hope our friends in Brussels will listen and make that change.Odds of the PMs deal getting passed shortened as a delay to Article  became less likely.Opening the debate this afternoon, Mrs May hinted at support for a new Brexit plan dreamed up by an unlikely alliance of Leavers and Remainers from across the Conservative party.The proposal, dubbed the Malthouse compromise after Housing Minister Kit Malthouse, would see an extended transition period designed to avoid chaos even in the event of a No Deal outcome.Mrs May said: While there are obviously details that need to be worked through, the fact that leading figures from dferent sides of the argument are coming together to develop proposals shows how much progress has been made over the past few weeks.Her commitment to fixing the backstop drew praise from top Brexiteers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg who said: May I thank her for her very clear assurances that the withdrawal agreement text will be re-opened and that she will be considering what has been called the Malthouse compromise.The DUPs Nigel Dodds added: She can be assured of our support in trying to find a solution which avoids any hard border on the island of Ireland but also avoids any borders within the UK.A meeting of the hardline European Research Group agreed to back the Brady motion - vice-chairman Steve Baker said: “A vote for the Brady amendment is a vote to seethe PM can land a deal that will work.But arch-Brexiteer Mark Francois warned that Eurosceptics could vote the deal down all over againthe concessions on the backstop aren’t good enough.Mrs May fought fiercely against Yvette Coopers amendment, which would have given MPs the right to delay Brexit by up to nine monthsa deal isnt secured by the end of February.Labour chiefs decided to back the amendment after a meeting this morning - and the Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum has publicly supported the move as the first step towards cancelling Brexit altogether.But it was defeated by a -vote margin after pro-EU ministers decided to back the Prime Minister.Mrs May vowed to bring a revised deal back to this house for a second meaningful vote as soon as we possibly can, adding thatthe deal hasnt passed by February  MPs will have another chance to declare their favoured solution then.And she mocked Labours shambolic Brexit policy, summarising it as, Lets have a few more votes in the future, possibly, maybe,we think it might be useful, at some stage.The PM concluded: If you want to leave with a deal you have to vote for it. If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit.Before todays debate, Business Minister Richard Harrington issued an extraordinary public warning to Mrs May not to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.After a crushing defeat a fortnight ago, she has won a vote sending her back to Brussels with a firm mandate to demand more from the Brexit deal.The EU can stonewall all it likes. But every binding Remainer motion to impede or delay Brexit was defeated.And there is no point Brussels bleating about the Withdrawal Agreement being set in stone. We know it isn’t. Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t.They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for.Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason. It is still more likely Brexit will be delayed, softened to a point that could tear the Tories apart or halted.But, after last night’s staggering turnaround, who knows He told the BBC: Many of us have been to see the Prime Minister and have told her the absolute catastrophe and disaster for jobs and the economy that No Deal would be.What she has asked us is that we give her another two weeks.Mr Harrington said he would quit as a ministerthe PM refused to give MPs another chance to rule out No Deal within a fortnight."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000464998159.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"leavers remainers together uk flourish brexit","story":"We all want certainty that we will be leaving the EU on th March.  That would enable us all to plan for le beyond Brexit and lead to a period of political calm.The Government’s deal has been rejected by Parliament.  Therefore, leavers and remainers need to come together to develop a new plan so that we can deliver the referendum result and ensure that we flourish outside the EU.This is exactly what we have tried to do with the help of Kit Malthouse.

The Prime Minister is planning to beg the EU to rethink the controversial Irish border backstop within days. MPs backed a move to resurrect Mrs May’s deal - for now. But before she had even left British soil EU chief Donald Tusk had rejected her Plan B. “The withdrawal agreement is not open for negotiation,” he said. Even Mrs May conceded there was “limited appetite” for her Plan B in Brussels and warned her backbenchers that negotiating it would not be easy.   But her surrender to the eurosceptic wing of her party dramatically ramped up the threat of the UK crashing out of Europe without a deal. She backed a plan supported by Tory hardliners which could lead to the country leaving on damaging WTO terms, putting workers’ rights at risk. Mrs May supported an amendment tabled by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border. Downing Street believes that the plan would give the PM the “ammunition” she needs to go back to Brussels and demand change.   MPs backed the plan  to , majority , to rip up more than two years’ of gruelling negotiations and send her back to Brussels.It raised the astonishing spectre of the PM walking through the lobbies with Tory rebels to effectively vote against her own Brexit deal.Tory whips slapped each others’ backs after the result. But their main focus was on the  Tory MPs who had helped crush the PM’s own Brexit plan two weeks ago, fuelling a record -vote defeat. Last night,  of those Tory rebels backed the Brady plan in the hope it would strengthen the PMs negotiating hand. At the same time, MPs rejected plans to delay Brexit by at least three months to give more time to reach a deal. They voted down an amendment by Labour ’s Yvette Cooper by  to , majority , that would have given them the power to step in and avoid no deal.Instead they backed an amendment by Tory Caroline Spelman to make clear they wanted crashing out taken off the table - but it was not legally binding.After the vote, Jeremy Corbyn revealed he was ready to meet Mrs May – after shunning talks for two weeks.The Labour leader said: “Tonight Parliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on March . “After months of refusing to take the chaos of no deal off the table, the Prime Minister must now face the reality that no deal is not an option. “I will meet the Prime Minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country. “That solution should be based around Labour’s alternative plan of a customs union with a UK say, a strong single market relationship and a cast-iron guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.” The dramatic Commons showdown brings back Mrs May’s deal from the grave - but it looked likely to be temporary. She told MPs backing the Brady plan would help her send an “emphatic message” to the EU that they had to compromise to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. “What I’m talking about is not a further exchange of letters but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement,” she said. Downing Street said the PM was proposing three potential changes to the Brexit deal. The “alternative proposals” including technical solutions, a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit cause. The hardline ERG group of Brexiteer MPs backed the Brady plan at the last minute after the PM gave a nod to further discussions on the “Malthouse compromise”. This could eventually see the UK leaving the EU with a ‘managed’ no deal - which critics warned would lead to a serious dilution of workers rights. In the Commons, Mrs May said the group had put forward “a serious proposal that we are engaging with sincerely and positively”. She added: “We will sit down and work through the proposal that has come forward.” But she still faces the threat of a rebellion from Remainer ministers to avoid no deal. Justice Secretary David Gauke was said to have warned cabinet colleagues that hardline Brexiteers would always demand more. He joked they would eventually ask: “Why can’t you persuade France to give back Calais ” Ministers including Welfare Secretary Amber Rudd, business minister Richard Harrington and defence minister Tobias Ellwood remained on No s watchlist. However, the PM’s promise of another vote by February  staved off the rebellion for now. One cabinet source told the Mirror: “They were reassured that Parliament would be able to step innecessary,there was no deal, to keep us from accidentally falling off a clf.” It means that MPs will now have to wait two weeks for their next chance to vote on Mrs May’s plan - kicking the can yet further down the road. But there was confusion in the Tory ranks as to what the Brady amendment would achieve. One former cabinet minister told the Mirror: “Dferent groups are interpreting it in dferent ways.   “Some see it as the route to a World Trade Organisation exit. Others just a few tweaks to her deal. It’s a stitch up for tonight but means nothing.” Yet before MPs had even voted Mrs May was preparing her MPs for disappointment. It comes just weeks after she warned that reopening talks was impossible and that any changes had to lead to “negotiable” outcomes. Mr Tusk said the Northern Ireland backstop was not up for negotiation, but welcomed Parliament’s desire to avoid a no deal scenario. “We continue to urge the UK government to clary its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible,” he said. “The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. “The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.” Speaking in Cyprus moments before MPs voted, French president Emmanuel Macron added: “It is not renegotiable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit vote summary 7 key","story":"NewsBrexit vote summary:  key moments on amendments night and what they meanTheresa May is now stronger and ready to fight the EU - but the battles impossible and it could all still turn against her.

The Prime Minister defied fears shed lose a string of votes in the House of Commons on what she should do next. Instead, MPs backed her bid to re-open talks with the EU on the -page Brexit deal - including the Irish backstop. It means shes been thrown into a bitter battle with Brussels - whose chiefs say reopening talks is impossible. Tonights results mean Brexiteers have won the day, with MPs blocking a bid to delay the  March date of Brexit. But are more dramas to come, because despite everything, MPs did also agree to reject the prospect of a No Deal Brexit . And with just  days left until we leave the EU, talks are still deadlocked. The deadlocks just moved back from London to Brussels. Its all bafflingly complicated, we know. So here is a simple summary of the  key moments from tonight, and what they mean.  MPs have finally agreed on something about Brexit. Two weeks after Theresa Mays deal suffered an all-time record defeat, they rallied round a form that can work. And crucially, she was backed by  of the  Tory rebels who defeated her last time. That suggests thatshe gets what she wants - a BIG- she could WIN a final meaningful vote in two weeks time. MPs backed a fantasy bid to rewrite the -page Brexit deal, laid down by senior Tory Sir Graham Brady, by  votes to . As recently as last night, top Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg were refusing to back the Brady amendment. But Mrs May won them round by promising legal changes to the Irish backstop, to stop it trapping the UK under EU customs rules. She pledged to rewrite a key clause by to look at alternative proposals, a time limit and a unilateral exit clause.   EU chiefs slammed the vote minutes after it happened - saying they WONT reopen talks on the -page Brexit deal. Instead theyre only offering to talk about the much smaller political declaration, which doesnt include the backstop. That leaves talks just as deadlocked as before. The deadlocks just moved from London to Brussels. An EU spokesman said: The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement. And the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation. If Brussels doesnt blink, MPs could turn back against Theresa May in a further vote on a revised deal around February . She told MPs: There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.”  In a major but only symbolic move, MPs ordered Theresa May to reject a no deal Brexit. The amendment, which was proposed by Tory MP Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey, passed by just eight votes. While  voted to back the amendment,  voted against. It doesnt require the government to do anything legally but it shows clearly the feeling of the Commons. And it lays down a marker for what happens nextTheresa May DOESNT have any success with the EU. When she comes back to MPs on February , that feeling against a No Deal Brexit could turn into action.  MPs voted DOWN a bid to delay Brexit in a move that ramps up the odds of No Deal. The House of Commons rejected an amendment by Labour MP Yvette Cooper,  votes to , to extend the  March date of leaving the EUthere was no progress by February . The shock -vote majority was a crushing disappointment for Remainers who widely expected to block a damaging No Deal. And its a bizarre contradiction to MPs decisionthat they dont want a No Deal Brexit. Basically, MPs agree there should not be a No Deal Brexit. But they cant decide on how to block it.  The pound fell after MPs defeated a bid to delay Brexit. Sterling fell .% to the days low of .. It shows markets are still jittery about the prospect of a No Deal Brexit, which with  days to go, remains very, very real.  Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to meet Theresa May to try and break the Brexit deadlock. The Labour leader repeatedly refused to meet the Prime Minister until she ruled out no deal Brexit . But after Parliament voted to reject no deal, Mr Corbyn said he would meet with the PM - even though the vote was only symbolic. “I will meet the prime minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country, he said. “That solution should be based around Labour’s alternative plan of a customs union with a U.K. say, a strong single market relationship and a cast iron guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.”  Theresa May had been expected to suffer a defeat at the hands of Tory rebels. But she was left much more secure, partly because she was backed by Labour ones. For example,  Labour MPs backed the Brady amendment. If theyve voted against, it would have still passed but by just a whisker. Meanwhile  Tory Remainers including Anna Soubry and Kenneth Clarke backed the plan by Yvette Cooper to delay Brexit. But  Labour MPs balanced them out by opposing Coopers plan - the majority of whom represent Leave-voting consituencies including Caroline Flint and Laura Smith as well as long term Brexiteers Ronnie Campbell and Kate Hoey. A further  Labour MPs abstained including Ruth Smeeth, Melanie Onn and Gloria De Piero who represent Leave-voting seats. And finally... We still dont know what the hell is going to happen  The message from tonight is weve had a string of contradictory messages - and no certain future for Brexit. Theresa May could still delay the date of Brexit in future, or be forced to, because MPs have made clear they dont want No Deal. Itll all turn against her, at least initially, when she has talks in Brussels. And it could all turn against her in Parliament tooshe doesnt get what she wanted. The next vote is on around February .

Criminal gangs are targeting youngsters to run the schemes, worth nearly poundmillion a year, a shock report warned County lines typically involves city gangsters branching out into smaller towns or rural areas to sell heroin and crack cocaine – often using youngsters as couriers because they are less likely to arouse suspicion. The phenomenon is so-called because of the phone lines used by dealers. Revealing the scale of the problem, the National Crime Agency’s investigations director Nikki Holland said: “Estimations from the report of , lines suggests that up to , children could be involved.” She told MPs that in  just seven police forces reported “being impacted on” by county lines.   But within two years all forces were affected, she said. Analysis by the NCA - dubbed “Britain’s FBI” - suggests there are more than , inidual deal line numbers in the UK - up from  in the last assessment. Highlighting the temptation to youngsters despite the dangers, National Police Chiefs Council serious violence coordinator, Assistant Chief Constable Jacqui Sebire, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee: “The county lines business model in some areas is actually the only option that they have to gain wealth, to gain prestige.” Warning of “cuckooing”, where gangs take over bank accounts and houses for drug dealing, Ms Sebire said the country was suffering a “real peak” in serious violence. “We have seen victims suffer the most horrendous injuries and they will still not either report or cooperate with the criminal justice approach,” she said. “They are much more scared of the county lines than they are of us.”   Analysis by the NCA found an inidual line can yield annual profits in excess of pound,. Some are estimated to generate thousands of pounds from a single daily delivery trip. They deploy children and vulnerable people as couriers to move drugs and cash between the new market and their urban hub. In its fourth annual assessment on the activity, the NCA said the supply of class A drugs through county lines is a “signicant, national threat”. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball, the NPCC’s gangs spokesman, said: “Wherever there is a drugs market, then the gangs will look to exploit it because we know each line brings in up to pound, a day. “Over the course of a year for one particular line we are looking at a signicant criminal enterprise.” Officers highlighted how offenders establish contact and build relationships with subjects before exploitation takes place. The analysis said: “This means that children may have been approached before the age of  in some cases as offenders seek to build a relationship that they can later exploit.” Gangs often target youngsters who are from poor backgrounds, have been kicked out of school or were previously in trouble with police. But children from “seemingly stable” backgrounds or without a criminal past are also targeted, according to the assessment. Offenders carry out recruitment both face-to-face and via social media, offering payments and material possessions victims would be unable to obtain through legal means. “This is enhanced by offenders’ use of social media, on which images and videos of cash, designer clothing, luxury cars and other high value goods are posted, creating a misconception that involvement in crime is rewarding,” the report said. It also flagged up an “emerging trend” around the use of app-based taxi services to transport offenders and potential exploitation victims to supply areas.   The area covered by the politan Police has the highest percentage of inidual deal lines, with %, followed by the West Midlands Policeand Merseyside Policeforce areas. The agency’s report said the county lines business model thrives on the exploitation of vulnerable adults and children to move and deliver drugs. Data from  indicates an age range of  to  for potential victims. Teenagers between  and  are believed to make up the bulk of the vulnerable people involved in county lines. Simon Blackburn, of the Local Government Association, said: “The exploitation of children and vulnerable adults by county lines drugs gangs is a signicant and growing concern for councils, who take this issue extremely seriously. “Effective partnership working at a local level between councils, the police, health services and charities and community organisations is essential to tackle and prevent drug related crime and safeguard those exploited by criminal gangs. “To help stop young people being exploited as drug runners, it is vital that government reverses years of funding cuts to local youth services, youth offending teams and councils’ public health budgets.” "},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron pocketed 800000 within","story":"NewsDavid Cameron pocketed £, within a year of quitting as Prime MinisterThe ex-Prime Minister has been accused of cashing in while the country hurtles towards a no deal BrexitShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsDavid Cameron has trousered some good earnings since he quit as PM \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA no-deal Brexit will not trouble David Cameron who pocketed almost pound, within a year of quitting as Prime Minister.

She was sentenced to three months in prison, and will serve half her sentence, after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Onasanya is the first woman MP to be sent to prison. The Peterborough MP was expelled by the Labour Party and has been working as an Independent since being found guilty last December. She is appealing her conviction butit upheld, a bi-election could be heldenough of her constituents sign a recall petition.  What is a recall petition  Under a law passed in , any MP suspended for more than  sitting days automatically triggers a recall petition that their constituents can sign. A recall petition can force a by-electionit is signed by more than % of the electorate in the Cambridgeshire seat. The petition will be open to sign for six weeks.Onasanya can then stand as a candidate in the by-election.As Onasanya is appealing her conviction and no recall petition can happened until this is dealt with. A recall petition can be openedan MP has been: convicted of an offence and received a custodial sentenceor ordered to be detained, other than solely under mental health legislation barred from the House of Commons for  sitting days or  calendar days, or convicted of providing  or misleading information for allowance claims under the Parliamentary Standards Act . What did Fiona Onasanya do  The Peterborough MP, who was expelled by the Labour Party, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by claiming someone  was driving her car on July  . The Old Bailey heard how Miss Onasanyas Nissan Micra was clocked speeding at mph in a mph zone after visiting a former political aide in her constituency. When she was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution, Mr Onasanya, , sent it back claiming a Russian man was driving, even though he was abroad. At the time, Miss Onasanyas le as a new MP was chaotic and she was coming to terms with being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But when she was pursued by police, she maintained her brothers lie out of misguided loyalty with disastrous consequences, the court heard. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said he was certain she had been behind the wheel on July  and had she accepted the speeding offence it would have had no real or lasting embarrassment to her as an MP. He told her: The impact of your conviction has been disastrous for you. The court heard Mr Onasanya, from Cambridge, provided  details to avoid speeding prosecutions on two other occasions. He had nine points on his licence and faced losing his licencehe got any more, the court heard. He was sentenced to  months in prison. Who is urging her to resign  Following her sentencing both Labour and Conservatives urged her to do the decent thing and step down. A Labour Party spokesman said she had let the voters of Peterborough down and should have resigned when she was convicted in December. He said: However, todays sentence gives Fiona one last opportunity to act honourably and resign from Parliament. She should do this without delay and not take another penny in salary from the public purse. If Fiona does not resign, Labour will support local residents in their efforts to trigger a by-election through a recall petition. A Conservative Party spokesman said: She cannot possibly represent her constituents from prison and should do the decent thing and immediately step down. If she doesnt, we will campaign to use a recall petition to ensure that the residents of Peterborough can have their say in a by-election for a new MP. Labour are ignoring the democratic vote of Peterborough and are doing all they can to frustrate Brexit for political purposes. The people of Peterborough deserve a Conservative MP who will respect their views. Miss Onasanya took the marginal seat from the Tories with a majority of just  at the  election just  months ago.

Jeremy Corbyn refused to take an intervention from Labour MP Angela Smith despite allowing other MPs to intervene. Ms Smith, who supports a second referendum, was repeatedly ignored leading to some Tory MPs shouting behind you while Mr Corbyn spoke.  Eventually she asked her party leader: Is my right honourable friend giving way or not  The Commons erupted as Mr Corbyn stonewalled Ms Smith and instead gave way to Yvette Cooper whose amendment the party leadership is now supporting.In the end Environment Secretary Michael Gove asked Jeremy Corbyn why he would not take an intervention from Angela Smith who, he said, has been a member of the Labour party for  years.While the Chief Whip Julian Smith held up a sign on which its understood he had written in biro: Angela wants to ask about a second referendum. Mr Corbyns stubbornness was raised repeatedly by other MPs. Tory Nadine Dorries askedit was in order for the Leader of the Opposition to only take interventions from male members. While Angela Smith herself wonderedthe Leader of the Opposition couldnt hear her because she was sat directly behind. But the Speaker insisted that he had done nothing wrong.  Ms Smith, who had wanted to ask about a second referendum, told Business Insider: Im sorely disappointed that the LOTO failed so badly to listen to what I had to say. It goes against the spirit of how we debate important issues in the HoC.  Labour MP Lisa Nandy said: After  hours we’ve had acres of heat but very little light. Now the chamber is full of people shouting, the Tory chief whip is waving pantomime props at the press gallery and an MP has just shown she doesn’t know what a point of order is. What an embarrassing shambles this is. The head of the Green Party Caroline Lucas also expressed her dismay. She tweeted: Parliament has descended into unprecedented farce  the idea that our EU colleagues will be watching this is excruciating. Greatest crisis in recent history - and MPs respond with braying, barracking  pantomime No wonder this place is held in such contempt.

Nothing better illustrates her humiliating status of impotent follower than the cowed Prime Minister pretending she’d be able to rewrite swtly a draft deal she personally negotiated with our European neighbours over nearly two months. This is phantom politics from a figure devalued faster than the pound when she’s ignored firm replies of no. non, nein and nee. We learned May’s word is a worthless plastic promise with this about her survival, not Britain’s.   Commons votes against leaving Europe with no deal and seeking vague “alternative arrangements” mean she’s going to Brussels and Jeremy Corbyn to Downing Street where he’ll find May’s door is open and her mind closed. She lives to die another day and playing Brexit Blackmail hopes enough MPs will eventually decide a iant of her bad deal’s better than no deal. Yet Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass with its Mad Hatter, Humpty Dumpty and Alice swallowed by a rabbit hole was believable compared with the humiliating tale of Twisting Theresa’s psychedelic contortions. Brexit delayed is likelier than ever and should May miss her  March deadline, the PM doesn’t need to look beyond Downing Street for somebody to blame. Should Britain accidentally crash out in a job destroying, income-wrecking catastrophic no deal, her fingerprints will be on the national disaster.   Putting party before country, shackling herself to Tory headbangers and revolting Northern Ireland mercenaries, will end in tears. Dire Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay’s embarrassing inability to explain what would replace the Northern Ireland so-called backstop to avoid a hard border was the vacuity of a hollow strategy. Brexit’s an expensive, destructive addition to Made in Britain scandals including the criminal gulf between poverty pay and Fat Cat aice and poorly funded schools and hospitals starved by Tory austerity. Tellingly during yesterday’s rehearsed speeches in Parliament we discovered blood donations in Kent are another victim of the uncertainty while the Conservatives used the debate as a smokescreen to sneak out fresh council cuts. Contradictory votes by MPs leaves nothing resolved we’ll be back here in a fortnight. What a carry on.

Ivan Dagg, ,was told he had just a % chance of successful chemotherapy treatment after being diagnosed with bowel and liver cancer in .But, after five years of multiple tumour removals and a wold-first liver operation, the father-of-two has been given the all clear, reports Hull Live .Ivan, an inspection engineer from Hull, first noticed something wasnt right with his health when he began losing weight and feeling constantly exhausted five years ago. After being diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer, Ivans health further deteriorated when the cancer spread to his liver - meaning he needed four procedures and chemo to save his le.  Last January, Ivan underwent his final surgery - with doctors saying without the procedure, he only had a few months to live. The operation at Spire Hospital in Leeds was hailed as a world-first after doctors found Ivan had grown a new vein in his liver, opening up a new and previously unknown avenue to recovery for others with a similar condition. Speaking about his emotional cancer journey, Ivan said: The last few years have been a rollercoaster. I’m finally feeling positive about my future. “I woke up after surgery and Professor Lodge told me he had been able to remove the tumour. That was fantastic to hear. “Now I’m back at work and looking forward to the future with my family. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the future but I feel very lucky. There could have been a very dferent outcome.”   Ivans surgery was carried out by Professor Peter Lodge, who described the surgery as very high risk. Speaking about the complicated procedure, world-leading expert in liver surgeries Prof Lodge said: Things went well so we were able to remove the tumour successfully along with the major hepatic veins, leaving Ivan’s liver surviving on only the new vein. “If he had not grown a new vein then I would not have been able to do the surgery. This was very high-risk and extremely complicated liver surgery and one of the most dficult that I have ever had to do. “Without surgery, Ivan would have been faced with having only a few months to live. I think that chemotherapy may have given him a few extra months but that’s all. It’s still early days but I’m very pleased with Ivan’s progress.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dads final moment holding hands","story":"NewsDads final moment holding hands with son, , before he was brutally murderedColin Horner, , was gunned down in front of horried members of the public at a Sainsburys car park in Bangor, Northern IrelandShareCommentsByMichael DonnellyNeil MurphySarah Scott:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video cctv-shows-dad-walking-son-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email CCTV footage shows a murder victim holding hands with his young son moments before he was brutally gunned down following a paramilitary feud.Colin Horner, , was shot dead as he placed his three year-old son into his vehicle in the carpark of Sainsburys in Bangor, Northern Ireland. Four men have been sentenced after pleading guilty to the dad-of-twos killing on May , , BelfastLive reports. Ryan Graham Smyth, , Alan James Wilson, , were sentenced to  years in prison, while Joseph Blair, , was sentenced to  years and six months. Robert Ralph, , was sentenced to  years. Mr Justice Colton slammed the killing as callous - especially as it was carried out in front of his infant son and members of the public going about their business.   The lone gunman took just  seconds from to carry out the killing in broad daylight. Prosecutors say it had the hallmarks of a contract hit. Detective Chief InspectorPeter McKenna said: This was a cold and brutal murder of a young man in front of his three-year-old son and I welcome today’s sentencing. On Sunday  May  Colin Horner visited a local supermarket with his young child and after picking up some groceries they ed to his car. Colin had just finished placing his three-year-old son in his car seat when a gunman jumped out of a Ford Mondeo and ran towards them, opening fire with a handgun.   Colin was hit several times and was left to die as the gunman ran back to the car which fled the scene and was found burning minutes later just a short distance away. Sadly Colin was rushed to hospital but did not survive the devastating injuries that he received. It is inconceivable that Colin’s son, who was just a toddler at the time, had to witness his father’s murder and this is a memory that he will carry with him for the rest of his le. Colin was also the father of a little girl who was just two years old when her daddy was taken in such a callous manner. This was a premeditated murder which I believe was linked toan ongoing South East Antrim UDA feud. The victim was followed throughout the day by a second vehicle, a black Ford Focus,in the lead up to his death and this enabled the gunman to pull up in the Mondeo at the supermarket and end Colin’s le in a matter of seconds.   The thugs responsible for this murder are hypocrites who think they have a right to act as judge, jury and executioner. They do not serve the best interests of the community and they have no place in our society. This reckless shooting took place in broad daylight, on a bank holiday weekend in a busy supermarket carpark which was packed with local shoppers and their children. These killers gave no regard to the trauma that they were causing to those who witnessed the brutal execution. The very normal routine of families buying food for Sunday dinners, barbecues and packed lunches for the week ahead turned into a nightmare as bullets were fired across the car park. This has been a long and complex investigation by detectives I would like to pay tribute to Colin’s mother Lesley and his partner Natasha for their calm and resolve throughout the process.   Colin was a much loved father, partner, son and friend and whilst no sentence can bring him back, I hope that these convictions offer some comfort as they cope with their grief. Police added that there may have been others involved in the murder of Colin who have not yet been brought to justice. Natasha, Colin’s partner, added: I would like to thank my family and friends, PSNI, the PPS and court services. Knowing that the people responsible for Colin’s death are now behind bars is a relief for me, my daughter but more so my son as he now knows the bad guys are in jail and cant hurt him anymore. His mother Lesley said: On behalf of myself, my children and the Horner family, I would like to thank the police who worked so hard to bring my son’s murderers to justice. Also to the police family liaison officers for showing love and compassion at the worst time of our lives, we thank you.

Bully Ronald Cooke laid out the extensive list of cleaning tasks for mum-of-two Tina Billingham, ordering her around their home. Spelling out which rooms she was to clean, he gave her strict time limits to complete the exhausting work, writing: hrs max. He also detailed exactly what she needed to do - and on which days of the week - to ensure that she got paid on pay day Fridays. Dust down everything, he ordered her, referring to his own room. Wipe down all cupboards, doors, frame, windows, empty bin, change bed, wipe bed down, polish TV, computer, printer...  Tina, a beloved mum and joker, died after Cooke stabbed her through the heart and liver with a sword stick nearly two years ago. The killer, then , launched his brutal attack after flying into a rage. Afterwards, he drove bleeding Tina, , to a doctors surgery and dragged her into the building, claiming she had injured herself. Despite the efforts of staff at Rowley Healthcare Surgery in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, the mum was later confirmed dead in hospital. She had been in an abusive and controlling relationship with Cooke. And in shocking scenes aired in the one-off Channel  documentary A Year of British Murder last week, her grieving sons from an earlier marriage showed just how controlling her killer was.  Appearing in the programme, they held up the shocking list of chores, titled The list of cleaning and penned in black and red ink. It concluded: Pay day will be Fridays. Work not done, no pay. Reading the document out, one of the brothers said: On Wednesday, put my clothes away. Bathroom, hall, stairs and landing. Thursday, dust away cobwebs, clean windows, clean doors, frames, shower, bath, curtain, floor and walls. Four hours first time. The brave young man later recalled how he once found his mum, from Cradley Heath, lying in bed with a black eye at around pm. All she did was panic, telling me to leave, telling me to leave - just go in case he comes back, he told the programme.   He added: So then I had to leave, I had to leave her there with a black eye, knowing that hed be back anytime. The brothers knew thatthey opened their mouths or tried to take action, their mum would have just got the backlash. They felt trapped, unable to help. Cooke was jailed for le at Wolverhampton Crown Court in August  after being convicted of Tinas murder. He was ordered to serve a minimum of  years behind bars. The court had heard Tina was still bleeding heavily when she was driven to the doctors surgery and dragged out of a van by Cooke. The killer was arrested at the surgery. He told medical staff his partner had stabbed herself during a row.   When later asked to explain how she could stab herself twice without him seeing her deliver the fatal blows, he replied: I cant. Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: Cooke was clearly a bully and was the root cause of an awful lot of misery in Tinas le, arrogant to the end he has shown no remorse. Men with his character traits have no place in a civilised society, he has now rightly been brought to justice. Tinas killing took place in February .

The shop worker applied for and was granted early release on Monday after serving a third of her sentence. Ms Plummer told The Sun: There were times when I thought this day would never come. I just want to get home and have a long bath and to get in my own bed. Ms Plummer flew to Europe on Monday and arrived back in the UK today.  She was arrested at the airport in Egypt on October   when she flew into the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. She claimed she was taking the tablets - which are legal in the UK but banned in Egypt - for her Egyptian partner Omar Caboo, who suffers from severe back pain, and had no idea what she was doing was wrong. Speaking about the impact of the prison sentence on their relationship, Ms Plummer said: I love him and he loves me and our love has survived the most traumatic of ordeals.   The Plummer family has previously said Ms Plummer had no idea that what she doing was illegal and was just daft. They said she did not try to hide the medicine, which she had been given by a friend, and she thought it was a joke when she was pulled over by officials after arriving for a holiday with her partner. Mrs Sinclair said her daughter was being held in terrible conditions in a communal cell with no beds, sharing with up to  other women.  Ms Plummer was freed on a presidential pardon after spending over a year in prison saying: My two-week holiday in the sun turned into a nightmare. She said: I tried to explain myself but nothing I said or did made any dference. It was just ridiculous. I wanted to help Omar and do a kind thing and I ended up in prison. At one stage I thought, ‘I must be dead and this is hell’.  On Sunday she was moved to a police station before making a brief court appearance where her release and deportation were approved. She spent a few moments with Omar before starting her journey back to Hull.A police spokesman said yesterday: It is all finished. The paperwork is here and she will be allowed to go.

The unnamed man was filmed in a pub chugging copious amounts of booze as hes encouraged to keep going by pals in the background. Celebrating his nd birthday, the man even changed into dferent outfits throughout the challenge - to prove he was downing a fresh beer each time. He also takes one pint on while blindfolded and goes on to strip off his top and expose his stomach to the rest of the pub.  The clip was posted to Snapchat by a friend, and included captions on his progress throughout the prank, reports The Sun.At the start, one caption read: Happy  birthday only  to go. Even after getting through an incredible amount of alcohol in such a short space of time, the man went on to have a rd encore pint.   After the challenge was over, his friends could be heard cheering and applauding him as he made his way back to the table. It is not known exactly what type of beer the birthday boy was drinking, although its cloudy appearance suggests it might be a type of ale, which has an average of  calories per pint. The man massively flouted the government recommended amount of alcohol- which includes no more than  units per week. This is equivalent to six pints of beer of seven glasses of wine over seven days.

Xeneral Webster, , doused Joanne Rand, , from head to with a corrosive substance. The mum-of-three, who worked as a carer, died in June  of multi-organ failure after contracting septicaemia due to acid burns. The police watchdog is investigating after it emerged that a Met Police officer had been investigating another acid attack on a woman, allegedly by Webster, three months earlier.  The officer obtained CCTV footage of the incident in North London in March , but allegedly did not circulate it for  months, until November . Police identied the suspect as Webster, who was already in prison for  years for Ms Rand’s manslaughter. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is now investigating the officer involved in a gross misconduct case, for alleged breaches of professional standards. The IOPC’s Jonathan Green, said: “This investigation raises the very serious question about the way a Met Police officer may have handled a crucial piece of evidence which may have identied the suspect of an acid attack.”  Ms Rand was attacked while sitting on a bench in High Wycombe, Bucks. A court heard Webster travelled to the area with sulphuric acid, which was knocked from his grasp by another man during a scuffle over a bicycle, covering Ms Rand in the substance. Webster, of Westway, West London, admitted manslaughter at his murder trial at Reading crown court. Ms Rand’s daughter, Katie Pitwell, , said afterwards: “With gang and drug crimes becoming so widespread, it is proven now that people do die from acid attacks. “This will never bring my mum back. I have to live with the fact that she’ll never be at my wedding or see my progress through le.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middleton shocking","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton: Shocking examples of trolls vile messagesKensington Palace staff have to spend huge amounts of time moderating the vile comments about Meghan Markle and Kate MiddletonShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience EditorRussell Myers:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe Palace has to monitor comments \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Kate Middletons staff are spending hours each week dealing with vile messages sent by trolls on social media.

Callum Musgrove and Dylan West, both , were sentenced to  years for the devastating assault on aspiring soldier Kia Morrison on May  last year. Mr Morrison, just  at the time, suffered le-changing injuries when he was punched by West and horrendously kicked in the head by Musgrove. His injures stopped stopped him pursuing his dreams of joining the army and ever having children. The fracas began when their friend Aaron Thompson was thrown out of the Soho nightclub in central Middlesbrough in the early hours of Bank Holiday Monday. Thompson hurled abuse at doormen, saying they had made a big mistake and they did not know who they were dealing with, and threatening to come back with a shotgun and shoot them. The other two joined him and the three -year-olds launched indiscriminate violence against door staff and other people, apparently sparked by the loss of a gold chain.   Within a minute or so, there was a brawl with Musgrove at its heart, prosecutor Nick Dry told Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday. He said Musgrove - who had received boxing training and fought two bouts - was dancing around asboxing on Albert Road. Mr Morrison walked by with his uncle as he saw the violence and tried to usher Musgrove away, the Crown said. He threw a missed punch as he backed away from an advancing Musgrove, who struck him with force. Then he was hit by West. Finally Musgrove kicked the dazed victim to the head and he fell to the pavement unconscious. The teenager suffered a complex skull fracture and a bleed on the brain and was fitting and bleeding heavily as he was taken to hospital with le-threatening injuries. He survived but faced the prospect of signicant disability for the rest of his le, using a wheelchair and needing help in day-to-day le. The attack destroyed his hopes of joining the Army and affected his speech, communication and his ability to enjoy becoming a father.   His grandmother stepped into the witness box to give a harrowing statement about the far-reaching effects on him and his family. Musgrove, appearing with West via video link to Durham Prison, cried as she spoke movingly in the courtroom. Yobs shouted that victim deserved it and they hoped he would die Yet at the time, Musgrove and West celebrated their assault, the former re-enacting his kick, the court was told. Some of the group were heard to shout that Mr Morrison had deserved it and they hoped he would die, added Mr Dry. Yobs removed shirts and carried on fighting with doormen, who took two men to the ground before the police arrived and arrested them. Others were injured in the melee - a doorman suffering a cut eye, another with bite marks to his arm, and a man kicked on the ground. West showed no remorse after his arrest, asking police: What am I being locked up for  Attempted murder  Thats the best thing for him. He and Musgrove claimed they acted in self-defence or as a peacemaker.   Musgrove, of Monksfield, Billingham, and West, of Norton Road, Norton, both admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm. But Musgrove was convicted by a jury of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They and Thompson, of The Heath, Norton, admitted affray. In his trial Musgrove apologised to Mr Morrison from the witness box, saying: Im sorry mate, and I hope you recover. I was acting like an absolute d***head and Im ashamed of myself. He had only a reprimand for theft on his record, Thompson a warning for assault as a youth and a fine for two assaults on police officers. West had been cautioned for racially abusing and punching a shopkeeper unconscious. He was given a suspended prison sentence for two assaults on Christmas Eve  , where he pulled a kne and threw punches at door staff when he was refused entry to a casino. Brian Russell, defending Musgrove, said: He still doesnt really understand why he behaved in that way. The reason he behaved in that way was because he had had too much to drink. He said Musgrove panicked over the loss of his gold chain and was described by a neighbour as a caring and gentle young man who had done work for charity.   Robert Mochrie, representing West, said he did not play the leading role, saying he got between the two to avoid any further confrontation and did not foresee the consequences when he delivered a single punch. Alex Bousfield, for Thompson, said he was not involved in the attack on Mr Morrison and struck out in panic when a group of males came towards him amid arguments with door staff. He said Thompson later apologised, regretted his foolish drunken behaviour and stayed out of trouble since. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, rejected the suggestion that Mr Morrison had squared up before the attack. He said: I do not accept for one moment that hes to be blamed in any part whatsoever. He said Thompson was the catalyst for the chain of events and Musgrove was jumping up and down, squaring up to them and your adrenaline was pumping. Why you were behaving that way I have no idea. He said Musgroves dreadful kick had catastrophic effects and consequences and le-changing injuries which, it was thought for many months, might prove fatal. He told Musgrove and West: After the attack you two went off relishing and celebrating about what you had done. Those who go for a night out are entitled to enjoy a decent night out without being confronted by people like you. Musgrove was jailed for -and-a-half years, West for five years, and Thompson for  months.

In , Lucinda also became one of just four successful living heart donors. All of them had “domino” transplants, where their hearts were gted to others while they were receiving donor organs. Doctors believe Lucinda, mum to nine-month-old Angus, is a one-off. She says: “When Angus was born last April, he became the only baby in the world to be born to a woman after a heart, lung and liver transplant.”   Yet Lucinda is well aware of the thousands who are not so fortunate. She hopes the Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign for an opt-out organ donor system inspires the rest of the world. “Without my donor, none of this would have been possible, which is why I’m backing the Mirror campaign to introduce the opt-out system,” she says. “Sadly, so many lives are lost due to long waiting times for transplant surgery in the UK.” Lucinda, from Queensland, Australia, was born with cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs and digestive system, and always knew she would one day need a lung transplant. “If you think of lungs as the size of a two-litre milk container, I was breathing ml instead of ,ml,” she says. “I had to stop shyworking, which I hated as my brain was fine. It was just that I couldn’t keep up. I couldn’t vacuum, make the bed or even do the dishes.”   Lucinda’s condition got so bad due to all her heavy medication that, by her early s, her liver had deteriorated. Doctors opted to replace her heart as well as her lungs and liver. She says: “My heart worked perfectly fine, but the doctors explained it would be easier to replace all three organs in one go. “It was easier to do the surgery like a car engine: put the heart, lungs and liver in as a block. You just lt one lot out and put the other lot in, so there are fewer connections.” Before the surgery Lucinda started dating her future husband, Damon. She says: “Other blokes I’d dated were like, ‘She’s just too high maintenance, I don’t want to deal with that’. “We’d only been seeing each other for a few weeks when I told him all about my condition and what was in store. “But he said, ‘Evenyou had no arms or legs and you were just a head, I’d buy you awesome hats for Christmas’. I knew then he was a keeper.   “I hadn’t even made it to the operating table yet, but I’d already given my heart away, to Damon.” Ten months later, on her th birthday, Damon proposed. The pair asked Lucinda’s pre-transplant teamshe would ever be able to carry a baby. She says: “We were told it was unlikely I’d survive long enough to have a family.” Then in June , four months before their wedding, the couple got a call as they were having dinner. Lucinda says: “I was told I was gettshying my transplant that night. Damon told me he loved me, then I was wheeled into the operating room while he waited with my parents, Kaylene and Jim.” A recipient was found for Lucinda’s healthy heart. “It was incredible, but it was bittersweet. “To give me a chance, someone had lost their le,” she says. Having been in and out of hospital all her le, Lucinda was not fazed as she waited to be put to sleep. “I was looking around fascinated at all the surgical instruments asking, ‘What does that do ’ “They’re like, ‘That’s going to separate your rib cage. This machine will be your heart and lungs for you as we operate’. I thought that was so cool. “I even asked to keep my old organs in a jar, but they suggested I donate them to medical science, which sounded like a much better idea.”   The -hour operation was a success and Lucinda was able to go ahead with her wedding, exactly two years to the day she first met Damon. Five years later, she told her doctor of her hopes of getting pregnant. “By then, he thought carrying a baby wouldn’t be a risk to my le. But it wasn’t as easy as just trying to fall pregnant,” Lucinda says. Her daily cocktail of medicine had to be carefully assessed to make sure it would not cause birth defects or miscarriage. Then, Lucinda’s heart, lung and liverhad to be rigorously tested. Getting ready to have a baby took years. “Pregnancy was not something we were rushing into,” she says. “We were not being irresponsible.” As the years passed, and she failed to conceive, Lucinda began to lose hope. Then, after their th wedding anniversary in , a routine blood test revealed she was pregnant. “We were both so surprised, Damon and I burst into happy tears,” Lucinda says. “The day before the -week scan, on Valentine’s Day, I felt our baby kick for the first time.” Angus was delivered  weeks early by emergency caesarean on April  last year,  years after the transplant.   “We’d been warned that, being a transplant mum, I was unlikely to go to full term. But giving birth at six months was way earlier than we expected,” Lucinda says. At just lb oz, Angus was whisked to the neonatal intensive care unit. Lucinda says: “I wasn’t allowed to see Angus for  hours. Even after that, I could only place my hands on him. “I just cried. I was so happy to have him, but I didn’t want him to be in a little glass box. I finally got to cuddle him when he was  days old.” The couple were allowed to take Angus home after nearly three months, when he had reached .lbs. He is happy and healthy. Lucinda adds: “I tease Damon, saying, ‘Do you want to do it again ’ He just replies, ‘I think we’ve been blessed with one’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"most unusual baby names revealed","story":"NewsMost unusual baby names revealed - including Sparkle, Princess Tracey and ChlamydiaMums have been sharing some of the most unusual baby names theyve ever come across - and some of them are just weirdShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN NewsBaby Champagne  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore and more parents are trying to come up with unique names for their children.

Carol Avenell, , from Bromley, London, was heartbroken to learn John* had been having an affair with -year-old Shelley Broughton. After coming clean, he promised his infidelity was simply a drunken one-night stand and Carol agreed to give the relationship another go. But when the two women started talking for the sake of their children,Charlotte, now , and Lydia, nine, they realised he was seeing them both at the same time. After both ditching John, the former rivals are now the best of friends - and even feel grateful that Johns actions brought them together. Were family, said Carol, speaking of their ten year friendship. I’m so glad we found each other. Carol told how initially she was attracted to how handsome John was – admitting their sex le was electric.   John had me smitten, she said. He was handsome and charming to boot. The more I saw of him the more I liked him. And I was thrilled when I realised he liked me too. We became a couple and spent our time down the pub having a laugh with friends. Sure enough, I was quickly falling head over heels for him. But it wasn’t all smooth sailing. We had our ups and downs and sometimes when we went out, John would end up flirting with other women. I couldnt blame them - he was gorgeous after all. And though there were times when I was fed up, there was something about John that always reeled me back in. He was like my drug I was addicted to him. Plus, our sex le was electric. Five years later, John sat Carol down and told her he wanted a baby.   My mouth gaped open in shock, Carol said. The topic of children had never come up before. But deep down, my stomach fluttered. I was excited to be starting a family with the man I loved. Three months later, I was staring at a positive pregnancy test. But when I broke the news to John, he looked stunned. He nodded slowly, as though reality had just smacked him round the face. He became distant and I had no idea what had come over him. Maybe he’s just scared, I thought. Months later I went into labour and I phoned John to tell him. At hospital, as my contractions grew closer, I waited for him to burst through the doors. Instead, I found myself giving birth to our daughter, Charlotte, without him. As soon as I cradled her in my arms, my worries disappeared. Until two hours later, when John finally turned up. At first, he was the proudest dad. He went from pub to pub, showing Charlotte off to all his mates. But it wasn’t long before he seemed to get bored. He spent less time with us and more time at work or out drinking. Even though I was still in love with John, our time apart grew and grew until I barely even saw him anymore. And then day, when Charlotte was almost three, I was surprised to receive a call from him out of the blue.   John revealed he had another daughter called Lydia and he wanted them to visit her. He said Lydias mum was a drunken one-night stand and they were no longer together. Carol said: After I’d hung up, my mind whirled. I couldn’t believe that my John, The One, had another family. Days later, I took Charlotte to the pub we’d agreed to meet at. I knew Lydia’s mum was coming along, so I downed a bottle of WKD for courage. And when I saw her, I was glad I had. She looked like she meant business. I smiled at her baby lying innocently in the buggy. My blood was boiling at the whole situation but it wasn’t the child’s fault. John appeared and we all chatted, before Shelley and I went into the beer garden, leaving the girls inside with him. Shelley asked what hed said about her and I told her, he said it was a one-night stand. Shelley burst out laughing - theyd been together for  months. My stomach flipped.  Shelley told Carol while they had been in a serious relationship, they had since split up. Later, fuelled with rage, Carol confronted John. Carol said: He told me she was lying and nothing happened between them. I thought maybe she was trying to make me jealous, so I ed home with Charlotte and soon, John seemed to start taking an interest in me again. I was thrilled when we picked up where we left off. The five of us continued to meet up regularly for the girls’ sake and It was lovely to see them bond. On Lydia’s first birthday we got together again, but John couldn’t make it. It was awkward without him there. There was a tension between me and Shelley and we had no choice but to talk. The more we chatted, the more John’s lies unraveled. He had told Shelley he had given me loads of money - despite never giving me a penny. But as soon as I spoke to him, he shook it all off. He assured me he was a liar and told me not to believe a word she said. I decided Shelley fancied John and was trying to put me off him. But we continued our meet-ups and the more time I spent with Shelley, the more it dawned on me. She wasn’t the liar, John was.  Carol decided to put her cards on the table and tell Shelley they were an item. But when she did, Shelley had her own version of events. Carol said: She said John had been pulling her into the bedroom at every opportunity. So hed been lying to us both - having his cake and eating it too. She explained they had split when she was pregnant and nothing had been going on at the time of our first visit. But soon after, things had started up between them again – around the same time Tony had been wooing me. Suddenly it all made sense. He’d been playing us off against each other, badmouthing us to one another so we wouldn’t become friends. From that moment on, Shelley and I became firm pals. We still met up with John so the girls could be with their dad, until he stopped making the effort. But all was not lost. The four of us had each other. Shelley and I see each other as much as we can and spend birthdays and Christmas together. We love nothing more than to watch our girls dress up in Disney outfits, dancing around the room together giggling. Charlotte and Lydia have each other as sisters and that is something really special. They are as thick as thieves – just like me and Shelley. We’re family. Thankfully we were able to see through John’s lies and have put everything that happened behind us. Despite the deceit and heartbreak, I’m so glad we found each other. And now we know that everything happens for a reason.  Shelley Broughton, , said: Carol and I were so in love with John that for a while we couldn’t see he was lying to us both. I had my suspicions and but John was always managed to convince me otherwise. I’m just so glad we have come out the other side and have each other as friends. I really want others who have gone through a similar situation to read our story and realise that it doesn’t have to end badly. You never know, you might even come out a happier person. *John is not his real name"},{"url":null,"title":"mum claims cat napper refusing","story":"NewsMum claims cat-napper is refusing tobeloved family petEXCLUSIVE Jessica Smith, , and her devastated children had given Felix up for dead before a vet phoned saying a man had brought in the microchipped catShareCommentsByLouie Smith:,  JAN NewsFelix has been cat-napped claims his owner\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum claims a family who found her kitten after it went missing are yet tothe beloved pet.

I was laid on the stretcher with Vincent on top of me when we arrived at hospital and we were suddenly surrounded by four brilliant doctors. They asked me was it ok to do this and do that, and I said yes, anything, but the frowns on their faces told the story.

Today she teamed the coat with black gloves, black block heels, a Manu Atelier green leather bag and pair of Princess Diana’s sapphire earrings.McQueen is a firm favourite of Kates, with Sarah Burton from the luxury fashion house designing the Duchesss wedding dress in . The couple, who last visited the city in , officially opened Scotland’s first design museum , VA Dundee, and unveiled a plaque before greeting members of the public. Scotland has a special place in their hearts as it is where their love story began in  while studying at the University of St Andrews .The attraction they opened this afternoon is the centrepiece of a poundbillion transformation of the Dundee waterfront, once part of the citys docklands. While meeting schoolchildren Kate remarked that she has “never seen a museum like this”. William , , and Kate , , the first royal patron of the VA, also met the team who helped create the poundmillion venue which has garnered interest from across the globe.It is named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, William’s great-great-great-great grandparents. More than , people have visited the museum since it opened to the public in September. It was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and the building takes its inspiration from the clfs along the north-east coast and stretches out into the River Tay. Kate and Wills were given a tour and shook hands with Mr Kumo before complimenting his work.   Kate also took to the stage and gave a speech in which she said: William and I are so pleased to be back here in Dundee to celebrate the opening of this wonderful museum today. Thank you so much for inviting us. Last February I was delighted to become patron of the VA in London. Now nearly a year later I am thrilled to be standing in a brand new VA - one which has been built for the city of Dundee and for Scotland. She added: “I hope that VA Dundee will serve as an inspiration to others by showing how great things can be achieved when dferent communities pull together and work for the common good. I have been captivated by the breathtaking architecture, and the sheer range of design on display. But most of all I’ve been moved by the passion of the people who work here, and the dedication of all those who have helped make this important project to succeed.   After leaving the multi-million pound building, Kate and Wills both wrapped up in scarves and headed outside to greet the well-wishers, some waving flags, who had gathered to see the VIP visitors. Kate, who was holding a gorgeous bouquet of flowers, stopped and chatted to the crowds, including to one woman who clutched the Duchesss hand. While William was seen speaking to adorable schoolchildren keen to show him their artwork of a Scottish flag. The royal pair were then driven to The Crescent community centre where they were greeted by the Lord Provost Ian Borthwick and a chorus of cheers from onlookers. They sat and had tea and cake with Dundee Michelin factory employees to hear first-hand how they have been affected by the news that tyre production is to cease on the site. It has been a huge part of the city and a key employer for generations. Last year it was announced it has been earmarked for closure, with around  people facing redundancy.  William later spoke at a meeting of the Michelin Dundee Action Group in which he said he hoped a positive way forward could be found during the period of uncertainty in the community. Todays visit also aimed to build on Kate’s keen interest in promoting the visual arts, and highlighting the value that public institutions like VA Dundee can offer local communities, particularly in terms of increased accessibility to world- class art and design. VA Dundee director Philip Long said: We are honoured to be welcoming the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to officially open VA Dundee. This official opening marks the beginning of a very exciting year, with upcoming exhibitions on videogames, robots and the future of design.   Through an eclectic programme, we aim to inspire people and provoke discussion about the role of design in everyones lives. Meanwhile, Scotland is where Kate and William first locked eyes on each other. They were studying at the University of St Andrews, and quickly became close after realising they shared the same naughty sense of humour. William studied history of art before switching to geography, while Kate studied art history. They both achieved :. The prince graduated alongside Kate in June  when he was .

John Betts suffers from a range of debilitating health issues and has been unable to work since suffering a heart attack in . He lives in a tiny, one-bedroom council home in Deighton, Huddersfield, ExaminerLive reports. The -year-old has now hit out at the much-criticised system which left people like him out of pocket. Vulnerable people need guidance on how benefits are paid, he says. John takes  dferent medications daily to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , angina, arthritis and nerve tumours. He is also being treated for depression and has attempted to take his le on several dferent occasions.  Im on permanent sick now after working all my le. In my last job I was a chauffeur valet. I was told I had to move to Universal Credit otherwise my rent wouldnt get paid. Thats where the problems started. The information I got was that my rent was being paid and that the money I was getting in my account was mine,so I was spending that money. It was all jargon to me. Even when youre not stupid, its complicated. Butmy Universal Credit payments hadnt gone to pay the rent. Soon I was thousands of pounds in debt and the court was trying to summons me for my council tax as well. I had no idea I owed them that money.  He estimates that he owes pound, in rent arrears and is afraid that he will eventually lose his tenancy. The Citizens Advice Bureau is steering John towards bankruptcy to clear his debt in an attempt to live as normal a le as possible. But John says Universal Credit is to blame for his predicament over payments which are often delayed for weeks. He said: It takes eight weeks between transition of benefits. No one takes account of that. I got an advance but I didnt know that my rent had to come out of that. I offered to pay an extra pound a month on top of my pound rent to cover the debt but then I realised that I couldnt afford it. Once Ive paid everything out Im luckyI have pound left. The last time I got paid I had pound to my name.  John was given his tenancy last summer and moved into the unfurnished flat. At one stage he slept on a towel on a bare floor. He explains: Everything in the house has been given to me. Its all been donated except the TV, which I bought for pound. No one told me I was eligible to use the food bank at Huddersfield Mission. I had no idea that I could get help like that. They are fantastic people. I got a seven-day parcel with bread, packet rice, beans, tins of steak and tuna, milk, tea bags and butter. I also got fresh veg, frozen fish fingers and potatoes but without a cooker I cant cook them Im very grateful because it could be worse, but its not enough. How do I feel  I feel swept away, brushed to one side. Im not a priority.  The Citizens Advice Bureau said they would do a bank insolvency order so that they cant chase me anymore. The only way Im getting out of this is by going bankrupt. Id rather give them the moneyI had it because they deserve it, but I simply dont have it. What they are trying to do is for the best but the government is holding them back. I am determined to settle here and make a nice home. I want to be able to pay my bills and have nice things occasionally. I just need a chance. But Im being ignored and I want to be heard. The DWP have been contacted for comment.

Pauline Jones, from Dublin, Ireland, was adopted from a Mother and Baby home - but has now finally met her -year-old biological mother, Kathleen. As a tiny newborn, Pauline was carried away from her Kathleen and from the home in a shoebox and adopted. Two years, ago, having always wondered about her biological mum, Pauline decided to take a DNA test and track her family history. After years of searching and only coming across a handful of distant relatives, Pauline finally hit the jackpot after finding her birth mum Kathleen in November last year.Speaking to RSVP Live , Pauline said: I cant believe it. We look so alike, I got a fright when I first saw her.  “Even my gestures are the same as hers. I was just trying to take everything in. “Who would have thought a -year-old would find her mother. Kathleen, who lives in a nursing home in Dublin, sadly has early stages of dementia and for Paulines first few visits to her mum, there was no recognition or remembering who she was. Pauline said: My brother said ‘do you know who that is ’ and she said no. He said ‘Mam, do you remember years ago you had a baby and you had to give her up ’ “He called me Mary because that’s what my mother wanted me to be called - my adoptive mother called me Pauline Mary.   She kept looking at me but there was no sign of recognition. However, on Paulines third visit to her mum, she was amazed when a nurse, pointing at Pauline, asked Kathleenshe knew who she was, to which she replied: that’s my daughter. Pauline added that her mother is always happy to see her and asks her to come back to visit again. Because of her early dementia, Pauline still has unanswered questions about why she was adopted and who her father was. Pauline added: It’s a shame becauseI had looked for her sooner, I would have got answers from her. My brother said to me the other day - ‘I’m thrilled we found each other but we’ve wasted  years!’   “I said we’ll just have to make the most of the years we have.” Pauline, who has since found four siblings she never knew about, said she was against taking a DNA test for years as she didnt want to hurt the person raising her. She added: I was also afraid that I would find my mother and she would reject me. I couldn’t cope with that - I’d rather stay the way I was. “The reason I finally agreed to do it was because my son and grandson are big into family trees, and they were struggling because they didn’t know anything about mine.   “They also pointed out thatthere were any ailments in the family, they wouldn’t know about them. So I agreed to do it.” Pauline had suspected she was secretly related to her adoptive mother, who carried her out of a Mother and Baby Home on the North Circular Road in a shoebox. However so far the tests have found no connection.

standing in a queue in Glasgow and spotted a woman carrying a violin case, so I asked hershe could play.#It turned out she was a member of the National Fiddle Orchestra.”Musicians attended from all over Scotland, mostly from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, but also England and even as far afield as the USA and Germany.There was the usual last minute panic, as T-shirts had been ordered both to identy the musicians and, cunningly, had music printed on the back to help the rows of players.But they didn’t arrive until literally minutes before the non-stop procession of tin whistles, guitars, bodhrans, banjos and fiddles appeared at the Mackie Academy school hall.Jubilation at a faultless performance by the -strong band was followed by frustration over the following months – new records aren’t declared official without stringent vetting of the evidence provided.Stonehaven Folk Festival secretary Meg Findlay said: “You can imagine how I felt when they came back to us in December asking for a list of names and instruments of all the participants.”So it is with a sense of triumph that the committee of the Stonehaven Folk Festival now declare themselves officially world-beating

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

Lord Kerr is a passionate Remainer, and one issue troubled him the same way it troubled me: that the vote to leave Europe was driven by English nationalism.Wherever you look now you see a political process harnessed to English nationalism. A few days ago Theran a piece suggesting ldquotherersquos one way for England to achieve Brexit ndash and thatrsquos by achieving independence from the UK.Therersquos a clear ldquoEngland First agenda at large. On the Today Programme, John Humphrys asks whether Dublin should leave Brussels, so the UK can gets its way over the Irish backstop. Instead of Dublin ldquotelling this country that we have to stay within the single market, therersquos an argument, says Humphrys, that Ireland should ldquoleave the EU and throw in their lot with this country. Itrsquos hard to think of a more absurd and arrogant proposal.Humphrys also says, as a matter of fact, that when ldquowe went to the polling stations to vote in the referendum hellip itrsquos unlikely that Northern Ireland would have been at the forefront of our minds. Did the Northern Ireland people ndash acutely aware of the risks to peace posed by a Leave vote ndash go blithely to the polls, in this England-centric world, not thinking of themselves  When Irelandrsquos Europe minister Helen McEntee told Humphrys that the UK Government had an obligation to protect the Good Friday Agreement, he told her she sounded ldquoa bit arrogant to a lot of people on this side of the Irish Sea.His comments came just a few days after dissident republicans planted a bomb in Derry. Perhaps, Humphrys should have reminded listeners that of the , people killed during the Troubles, more than  were British soldiers.Is this what an English nationalist Brexit looks like  Demanding Ireland kow-tow to England. Flagrantly disregarding and thereby endangering the peace process in Northern Ireland. Even forgetting dead veterans amid the delirium of Brexit. Do English nationalists not caremore young men from Bradford and Birmingham go and die in the Bogside and Ballymurphy  Because there is a very real risk that will happentheir hard border falls over the island of Ireland.Theresa May is now being pushed by extremists like Boris Johnson to secure changes from the EU on the backstop. It will be a ldquofreedom clause, says a man who has parlayed a career from lies, and cares about nothing but himself.Europe wonrsquot budge on the backstop, because Ireland wonrsquot budge on the backstop. Europe will stand by Ireland no matter what. This is what English nationalists need to learn: that their decisions leave them alone in a world where unity is paramount. It will be a cold place for little Englandersthey ever get their way, and that is what makes them so hard to understand ndash they would maim themselves and others to achieve what they see as a ldquowin.Sanity seems to be coming apart at the seams in the world of the English nationalist. Tory MP Mark Francois, of the European Research Group, lost it a few days ago when he all but chewed the microphone during a TV interview. Incensed by a letter from Tom Enders, the German chief executive of Airbus, warning about the catastrophe of Brexit, he proceeded to shred the pages live on air. Calling himself a ldquopatriotic Englishman, Mr Francois ranted about ldquoTeutonic arrogance before proclaiming his father was a D-Day veteran whorsquod ldquonever submitted to bullying by any German, neither will his son. The war still rages in the English nationalist mind.Meanwhile, the Government plans for martial law in the event of no deal, Jacob Rees-Mogg calls for the suspension of democracy, and tycoon Brexiters like James Dyson jump ship to Singapore.Scotland and Northern Ireland cannot be led to ruin against our will by the whims, nostalgia and reactionary fury of a hardcore cabal of English nationalists who have hijacked politics south of the Border.The Scottish independence movement is the polar opposite of what we see in English nationalism. There are no far right thugs, no threats of violence, no dangerous slurs like ldquoenemy of the people thrown around with revolutionary zeal, and little hatred ndash though personally I could do with less Saltires, marching and ldquoSaor Alba nonsense. Voting Yes was not an anti-English vote, it was a vote for a fairer, more positive and open world which Westminster was standing in the way of ndash sure, the Yes movement has its fair share of cranks and idiots, but those are mostly confined to the conspiracist corners of the internet.If the English nationalists seem set to get their way and drag Scotland and Northern Ireland out of Europe, against our will, like hostages in the boot of a car, then the only course of action is for the Scottish Government to move for an independence referendum at the earliest opportunity. Sane people donrsquot allow themselves to be the captive of an extremist who seems intent on wanton destructionthey donrsquot get their own way.Read more: Article  author says there will be another referendum"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-teachers-face-uncertainty-over-contracts","story":"New figures show  per cent of the , teachers recruited under the Scottish Attainment Fund dont have permanent contracts - raising fears over job security and the long-term effectiveness of the project.Opposition politicians and teaching unions said the figures raised concerns over whether the Scottish Government scheme was a ldquoquick fix which masked serious underlying problems of recruitment and retention of teachers.Launched in  by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the pound million Scottish Attainment Fund aims to target resources at councils serving areas with the greatest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils. The initiative includes the Pupil Equity Fund, which targets money directly to schools and can be used at the discretion of headteachers.In December, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, welcomed figures showing hundreds of new staff were employed as a result - with overall teacher numbers rising to , after an increase of  from the previous year.\"Despite the SNPrsquos smoke and mirrors routine, this is just not what our schools need. Headteachers are unable to plan ahead due to funding uncertainty and skilled staff are left in insecure positions, which will only make the major issues of teacher retention even harder to solve.ldquoThis is a paper-over-the-cracks arrangement by ministers. They know it does not compensate for a decade of funding cuts and the resulting loss of permanent teachers and additional support needs staff.\"Mr Greer called on the Scottish Government to end the \"hand to mouth\" funding arrangements for councils and schools.\"These posts, valuable though they are, are short-term only and so not guaranteed to be retained in future years. These posts were always intended to be additional resource on top of the existing teacher workforce, and cannot be viewed as a replacement for permanent teaching posts.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoWe would encourage local authorities to employ teachers on full-time contracts and have given an absolute commitment to the Attainment Scotland fund over this parliamentary session.ldquoThere is obviously regular turnover within the teaching profession. Vacancies arise and can be filled as and when they do and the arguments to make more of those posts permanent are compelling.ldquoWe are pleased however, to see progress made with the recruitment of  full-time equivalent teachers through the attainment Scotland fund. This contributed to the increase in teacher numbers of  we saw last year, which was a welcome increase to the teaching profession in Scotland.A spokesman for council umbrella body Cosla said: \"This is a perfect illustration of why the Pupil Equity Fund gives neither councils nor employees the security we need.\"It is short term funding which is only guaranteed until the end of this parliament and yet the services it provides have become an essential and core component of our work in improving attainment and closing the attainment gap.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-independence-could-only-add-to-the-nations-woes","story":"And while emphasising the failings where, the article does not address the reality of breaking up the UK. So no mention of the pound billion annual transfer from the UK to Scotland, a sum that would be lost immediately on severance. No mention of the fact that the UK is Scotlands closest and biggest export market, accounting for four times the value of our exports to the EU. And by the way, we would be out of the EU as well, so no relief there. WTO here we come. No mention of the need for a currency, a central bank, foreign currency reserves and a credit record for the borrowing that would be inevitable in the circumstances. No mention of the hard border at Gretna and the costs of that to our economy. All of these problems and more were highlighted in the SNPs own Inclusive Growth Commission Report, but no solution is proffered there or by Mr McKenna.While he makes much of the failures of Brexit, he misses the main lesson of that benighted project: that breaking up a union between and among states is fiendishly dficult. We see the shambles of breaking off from the EU after  years. How much more of a shamblestrying to disentangle a -year-old union  Brexit also shows how such ill-prepared adventurism can cause all sorts of splits in a society. Indeed, these splits were evident in Scotland during the  referendum campaign and we would not be free of them in a re-run, but Mr McKenna gives them no weight nor even any consideration.So it is possible to agree with him that the country is in a dficult place at the moment and that political leadership is noticeable by its failure. But it is not possible to see, and Mr McKenna has not made the case, that all or any of the problems we face would be improved by adding independence to the poisonous brew. Indeed, it is hard to see how independence would not increase our woes.Last week the First Minister prepared her supporters to go out and make the case for independence on the doorsteps. The problem for her and for them is that all the hard facts and evidence, including the SNPs own publications, show that there is no positive case for independence. And while Mr McKenna is entitled to hold the minority view, and against the evidence, that it might be nice, it is certainly not a necessity.Alex Gallagher,Labour Councillor Ward , North Ayrshire Council, Phillips Avenue, Largs.THERE are many people who think Theresa May should have resigned when she suffered such a huge defeat on her flagship Brexit policy. In a first-past-the-post Parliament I tend to agree. Holyrood, with its more proportional voting system, offers more leeway for the party of Government.The present SNP Government is struggling to get a budget through against unitedopposition . As a budget is an essential government , then it should let it be known that defeat would be a resignation issue. Give the disparate opposition parties their place in the sun, form a coalition government and enact the few policies they have espoused with the sources of funding they claim to have identied. The rest of us can kick back and watch the ldquofun.I think a new election would come pretty quick, but it would clear Scotlandrsquos political air and a give a new mandate for the winner. All good.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon, perhaps understandably, is impatient with Theresa Mays apparent inflexibility to sht from her Chequers Brexit proposal and offer a Plan B. There are, however, parallels with Ms Sturgeons own behaviour on constitutional matters.The SNP leader wont stray from her Plan A ndash strict adherence to nationalist dogma and independence. The people of Scotland of course voted against her in  and virtually every opinion poll since, predicts the same result. Yet Ms Sturgeon doggedly carries on, without a Plan B ndash she is determined we leave the UK, just as the UK is leaving the EU.Yet, in the medium term, she does have a Plan B of sorts. She knows her demand for another independence referendum will be rejected by Downing Street. Her Plan B is clearly to convert that rejection into a grievance to nurture until the next Scottish election. Ms Sturgeon will then relentlessly campaign for a nationalist majority in , followed by an independence referendum in   and achieving Plan A: separating Scotland from the rest of the UK.Martin Redfern,Woodcroft Road, Edinburgh.A WEEK may be a long time in politics, but it is nothing to theof time during which Alexander McKayhas been predicting the demise of the SNP. And I donrsquot think his prediction will prove any more accurate now than ever in the last few decades.The charges which Alex Salmond is facing may be a problem for him, but it is not a problem for the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon has said unequivocally that plans for a new independence referendum will proceed as anticipated . Still less is it a problem for the grassroots independence movement, which by all reports is steadily gathering strength.As the Brexit fiasco descends into unimagined levels of sheer stupidity, and the two main Westminster parties display their incompetence more shamelessly by the day, the need for Scotland to escape from this morass could hardly be clearer. Despite what Unionist commentators may fondly dream, the fact that a prominent member of the independence movement is soon to appear in court has no bearing on this.Derrick McClure, Rosehill Terrace, Aberdeen.Read more: Independence is no longer a nice idea, its a necessity"},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-its-time-we-had-some-laws-for-governing-social-media","story":"Though Molly had shown no signs of mental illness in the run up to her death, Ian Russell said the viewing history his youngest daughter left on the family computer left him in ldquono doubt that Instagram had played a part in her death, with around  of the accounts she followed seemingly normalising and, by extension, encouraging self-harm. ldquoWe went to one [account] Molly was following and what we found was just horrendous, Mr Russell said in an interview with The Sunday Times. ldquoThey seemed to be completely encouraging of self-harm, linking depression to self-harm and to suicide, making it seem inevitable, normal, graphically showing things like cutting, biting, burning, bruising, taking pills. It was there, hiding in plain sight.Worse still, when he looked at Mollyrsquos email account he realised that Pinterest - a site usually seen as the place where the middle classes gather images to help them design their homes - had been sending her automated alerts linking through to similarly disturbing material. ldquoIn the same way that someone who has shown an interest in a particular sport may be shown more and more posts about that sport, the same can be true of topics such as self-harm or suicide, Mr Russell said. ldquoThis one was sent after she died mdash therersquos a picture of self-harm on it. They were actually emailing her pictures of self-harm, so Pinterest has a huge amount to answer for.He is not the only bereaved parent who feels that way, with suicide-prevention charity Papyrus reporting a spike in calls to its UK helpline since Mollyrsquos story was reported last week. The callers, a spokeswoman for the charity said, were ldquoall saying the same thing, that social media had had a part to play in their childrenrsquos deaths.Given the complex layering of issues that surround any suicide, there can be no absolute certainty that such causality exists. Yet given that young lives are potentially being put at risk, the alternative - assuming there is no causality and taking no action as a result - would seem to be woefully inadequate. The problem is, in the absence of laws setting out what can and cannot be done online, working out what kind of action would be adequate is easier said than done.As things stand social media companies have their own policies in place for dealing with content that is deemed to be inappropriate, though as there is no unormity of approach it is easy to see how some posts can slip through the cracks. And, while Facebook executive Steve Hatch said he was ldquodeeply sorry that social media had been implicated in Molly Russellrsquos death, it is also clear that the site is loath to intervene in its usersrsquo activity, with Mr Hatch noting that it will not remove potentially distressing contentit appears to have been posted by someone looking for support from an online community. Instagram and Pinterest take a similar approach, although both have committed to reviewing their enforcement policies.Unsurprisingly Molly Russellrsquos father would like to see things go much further, and he has called for an independent UK regulator to be set up to ensure distressing material is removed from social media sites within  hours of being posted. Though health secretary Matt Hancock - who gained experience of the digital world during a two-year stint as a minster in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport - has made similar calls himself in the past, for now he has simply written to the main social media companies urging them to ldquopurge harmful content from their sites ldquoonce and for all.How successful this will be remains to be seen, with the onus at this stage being placed on the internet and social media providers themselves to, as Mr Hancock wrote, ldquoensure the action is as effective as possible. They have hardly shown willing in this respect in the past, with Facebook in particular being implicated as an enabler of peddlers of fake news, while the other main sites have come under fire for the apparently arbitrary way in which their rules are applied.And though Mr Hancock has warned that the Government will not be afraid to ldquointroduce new legislationit feels social media firms are flouting the demand that harmful content be removed, the parameters of that threat are so ill-defined it is hardly likely to result in serious action from either side. Meanwhile, without a universally accepted understanding of what harmful content is and what needs to be done to remove it, there will always be a danger that more children like Molly Russell will be able to access it.Given its relative newness and global reach the internet is often seen as a lawless place, but it doesnrsquot have to be that way. Dangling the threat of legislation in front of social media firms is one thing, but the Government could take action to ensure a rulebook is there for everyone to follow.

One of the problems with Brexit has been that the UK wants to leave such as freedom of movement, the authority of the European Court of Justice, while having full and free access to the EUrsquos single market, have frictionless trade etc. This might even be characterised as wanting to leave the EU, not follow its rules, but still enjoy the privileges of membership. In contrast, where Scottish independence is concerned the clue is in the aim ndash independence. Its not asthe aim is to be independent of the UK, but to continue to secure all the benefits that there might be. A comparative analogy might be that the UK wants to leave the EUrsquos golf club, but still nip on for  holes, while Scotland plans to set up its own golf club apart from the UK. Or, just remain in the EUrsquos golf club Where I can agree with Councillor Gallagher is that there should be a positive case for independence, and I think there is one. However, realistic politics can just as well be based on the negative assertion that one outcome is worse than the alternative.

However, Councillor Gallagher appears to think that wallowing impotently in an increasingly dysal UK is preferable to Scotland taking its future into its own hands, respecting the result of the EU referendum in Scotland and participating as an independent nation within the EU.He asserts that Scotland would be out of the EU, but given that they have had decades of dealing with reluctant UK governments, it must seem like a breath of fresh air to Europe that Scotland voted so enthusiastically to remain, and the oil-rich nation of Scotland would surely be considered a welcome addition to the European Union. There are plenty of examples of countries which have successfully gained their independence, and the solid support which the EU has shown Ireland in these Brexit negotiations is in marked contrast to the lack of recognition the UK Government has shown to Scotlands expressed preference to remain within the EU.

If none of the previous amendment gets a majority, there will be pressure on some Brexiteer Tories to back the Brady amendment, not least to avoid criticism that Parliament when given an array of options could not decide on even one.Conservative sources told The Herald that there was movement from members of the anti-EU European Research Group towards the Brady amendment. Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson said he would \"gladly\" vote for it,it meant legally binding changes to the backstop.Earlier today, Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists announced they too were supporting it, helping its chances of getting through.Also up for debate is a cross-party proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles - backed by the Labour frontbench - which would hand control over the Brexit process to Parliament, potentially delaying departure day from March  to the end of the year.Jeremy Corbyn stressed how the Labour leadership was backing the Cooper amendment with a view to having a ldquoshort window of three months to allow time for renegotiation\".He claimed the Government was \"not even close\" to being prepared for leaving the EU without an agreement and pointed out there was \"no chance\" the necessary legislation would be approved eventhe PMrsquos deal did achieve an eventual majority.The Labour leader told MPs their first duty was to block a \"disastrous\" no-deal Brexit.His speech was dogged by a row over his failure to take interventions from MPs, including from his Labour colleague Angela Smith.Eventually, he relented and allowed Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, to interrupt him and speak from the dispatch box, who then asked why the Labour leader was \"scared\" to allow Ms Smith to come in on what he was saying.Mr Corbyn ignored the question, instead mockingly thanking Mr Gove for his \"brief statement of his leadership intentions\".Mr Bercow was forced to intervene several times, accusing the Conservative benches of an \"orchestrated attempt\" to try and \"shout down the Leader of the Opposition\".It led veteran Labour MP Frank Field to suggest that the debate was \"damaging to our standing with the nation\", and that it should be shut down and MPs moved straight on to the voting, an idea the Speaker firmly rejected.Mr Bercow also selected Labourrsquos own amendment - which would allow debate on its preferred plan or a second referendum - as well as others which would rule out a no-deal Brexit, extend the two-year negotiation under Article  or permit a series of \"indicative votes\" to establish the will of the Commons.In his intervention, Ian Blackford for the SNP said Scotland must have the right to determine its own future and choose to be an independent nation within the EU.\"Let me be very clear: Scotland must no longer be left at the mercy of events. Whatever happens here, the SNP will not be dropping its policy of independence, he declared.The Highland MP went on: ldquoThe Scottish people are sick and tired of being told what the Prime Minister wants them to do Scotlands needs are much more important than what the Prime Minister wants.ldquoScotland needs the power to take its own decisions thats the only way we can stop the Tories dragging us off the clf-edge and into disaster,\" he added.In an attempt to fend off a possible rebellion by Tories, seeking to avoid a no-deal departure, perhaps even some within Government, the PM promised that Tuesdays votes would not be MPs final chance to pass judgement on EU withdrawal.She told the Commons she aimed toto the House \"as soon as possible\" with a revised deal, which would be subject to a \"meaningful vote\" of MPs. If defeated, she would table another amendable motion for debate the following day.If no new deal is reached by February , the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Mrs May acknowledged that the Commons defeat of the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with EU leaders last November had been \"decisive\". She told MPs: \"I listened.\"The PM claimed it was in the interests of the whole House to back the Brady amendment, which would resolve the main obstacle to Britain securing a smooth and orderly exit from the EU.She said it was time for Parliament to \"speak as one,\" stressing: \"I will never stop battling for Britain but the odds of success become much longerthis House ties one hand behind my back. I call on this House to give me the mandate I need to deliver a deal this House can support.\"Do that and I can work to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Do that and I can fight for a backstop that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland in a way this House can support. Do that and we can leave the EU with a deal that honours the result of the referendum.\"So the time has come for words to be matched by deeds. If you want to tell Brussels what this House will accept, you have to vote for it. If you want to leave with a deal, you have to vote for it. If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit.\"Mrs May was expected to have more talks with Tory colleagues in her Commons office as the debate continued. She spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, this morning and was also due to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day.Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, and Irelands European affairs minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned: \"There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.\"However, Mrs Mays spokesman stressed: \"There is a very clear message from the EUs leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mps-back-theresa-mays-bid-to-change-brexit-plan","story":"Following the result, Mrs May said she now had a mandate to take back for further negotiations with the EU.She said: \"Tonight a majority of members have said they would support a deal with changes to the backstop combined with measures to address concerns over Parliaments role in the negotiation of the future relationship and commitments on workers rights in law where need be.\"Its now clear there is a route that can secure a substantial and sustainable majority in this House for leaving the EU with a deal.\"We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\"Jeremy Corbyn said because the Spelman amendment had passed he was now willing to meet Mrs May for talks on the Brexit next steps.:Brexit debate: MPs vote for Withdrawal AgreementIrish border backstop replacedThe Labour leader said: \"Now that the House has voted emphatically to reject the no deal option the Prime Minister was supporting could I say we are now prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party of the kind of deal we want from the European Union.\"To protect jobs, to protect livings standards, and to protect rights and conditions in this country.\"Mrs May said it was also clear there was a majority against a no deal Brexit and invited opposition MPs to meet her to discuss how to reach consensus.\"As well as making clear it needs to approve the Withdrawal Agreement, the House has also reconfirmed its view it does not want to leave the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement future framework.\"I agree we should not leave without a deal, however simply opposing no deal is not enough to stop it.\"The Government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal this House can support.\"n a dramatic series of votes, MPs rejected two proposals to delay Brexit by extending the two-year Article  negotiation processMrs May was unable to secure an acceptable agreement by February .And they also voted down a plan by former attorney general Dominic Grieve for a sequence of \"indicative votes\" to establish MPs preferred Brexit outcome.The pound dipped sharply after the failure of the attempts to delay Brexit, losing around .% against both the US dollar and euro, though there were indications later that it may be rising.CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described it as \"another deeply frustrating day for British business\".\"The Brady amendment feels like a throw of the dice,\" she said.\"It wont be worth the paper it is written onit cannot be negotiated with the EU. Any renegotiation must happen quickly - succeed or fail fast.\"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson dismissed Mr Tusks statement, telling Sky News: \"There is a negotiation going on.

I wouldnrsquot say Sir David Attenboroughrsquos punky younger brother had gone overboard with the puffa jackets, buthe had been dropped from a plane over George Square he would have bounced.The entire show, running over four nights this week, was the kind of advertisement for Scotland money cannot buy. VisitScotland staff must have been hugging themselves.The serious conservationists among us waited patiently till the more juvenile of the audience at home got the sniggering out of their system at mentions of crested tits, great tits, blue tits and suchlike. Really, grandpa, every year  Packham mentioned faeces a lot and delightedly read out a report of birds feasting on a corpse. Maybe VisitScotland can edit that bit out. Controversial as ever, he called Braveheart ldquoabsolute rubbish. Fair enough, though Irsquom not sure all the two legged wildle up here would agree.What, then, were the scores on the doors last night  How many golden eagles, wildcats, and otters had been spotted  Er, none, but a mouse had been seen in a bothy. Well worth the licence fee. There was better value to be had from the night camera footage, where we saw a pine marten being spooked by a badger. Eat your heart out, Yoursquove Been Framed.There was a brown hare on the live thermal camera, and four badgers. Earlier there had been deer, but so common are they in these parts the producers didnrsquot even bother showing them. You will have to up your game, Bambi,you want to get on live telly. Try juggling.Fortunately, there was a ldquoone we made earlier film introducing the area to those unfamiliar with it. Did you know, for example, that Scotland used to be called Caledonia, and that the Cairngorms are quite a way from Edinburgh To counter the cold there was a fire pit in the teepee studio in The Dell of Abernethy, but Strachanrsquos nose was still red enough to audition for Rudolphrsquos job. Joining Packham and Strachan were Gillian Burke and naturalist Iolo Williams, who was the size of his three co-presenters combined. If the temperature plunges even further the three of them could set up home in one of his armpits.Packham clearly loves it here, and he spoke warmly about the conservation work going on in the area, with one project set to run for  years.

A day later, she survived a Tory confidence vote but she was badly bruised given a third of her MPs, , failed to support her.Yet last night, she was back up on the canvas being cheered to the rafters by Tory loyalists after the amendment backed by her Government fought its way through Parliament.One by one the previous amendments - to extend the Article  process and allow MPs a series of indicative votes - were knocked out to great Conservative roars.The tension mounted as the votes went the Governmentrsquos way but then the Spelman Dromey amendment, simply rejecting the notion of leaving without a deal, was narrowly passed.While not legally binding, politically, it will tie the PMrsquos hands somewhat, particularlyat the end of this process, she s from Brussels with no agreement.The final vote came on the Brady amendment. Backed not only by the PM and her Government but also Brexiteers, the Democratic Unionists and indeed seven of Labourrsquos usual suspects.

Having rejected Plan B, there is already a Plan C in the wings.The so-called Malthouse Compromise, which seeks to recast the backstop as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides that there should be no hard border. Plus there would be a yearlong extension to the transition period, which will not go down well with the Scottish Conservatives because of the prospect of the country staying in the hated Common Fisheries Policy for an extra year.But with Remainer, Brexiteer and DUP backing, this could give the PM an even bigger mandate in what would be another meaningful vote. If this passes and she sees off another amendment to reject a no-deal outcome, she couldto Brussels and try again.The dference will be the timing. By then, it will be late February, a month to go before exit day.Whitehall believes Brussels only makes concessions at the very last moment a whites-of-their-eyes moment.In the biggest gamble of her political career Mrs May will tell the likes of Messrs Juncker and Tusk that Parliament is backing Plan C and that is it.But how hobbled will she be by Parliament rejecting a no-deal outcome  Could ministers resignshe does not abide by this political order from Parliament and threatens Brussels with no-deal If the last two weeks in politics were a letime, the two ahead will also seem so.

vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local musicians Morag McCormick and Arthur Coates try out the studio equipment\"  Musicians bank recording time with new play and exchange deal viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"He also stressed that Aberdeenshire Council waste teams would continue to visit every house in the region every week.*What’s your view  Visit our Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"charity to mark 140th anniversary with celebratory ball","story":"Local charity North East Sensory Services will mark  years of improving lives with a celebratory Ball to remember.The charity operates with the main aim of achieving independence for blind and deaf people.The prestigious Ball event will take place at Aberdeens five-star Marclfe Hotel on Friday, March .A wonderful line-up of entertainment will be topped with a live performance set from singer, radio and television presenter, Aled Jones MBE.Aled has been a household name since the s, and will be forever noted as having been one of the worlds most successful boy sopranos.He is best known for singing Walking in the Air in the animated film, The Snowman.His theatre work is world famous too, having enjoyed starring roles including Joseph in Andrew Lloyd Webbers Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat.The Ball event will be hosted by Emmerdale favourite Chris Chittell, best known for his role as Eric Pollard in the ITV soap.Entertainment will also be provided by top class live band Callanish.Stronachs are kindly sponsoring the champaign reception at the event.A spokesperson for the law firm said: \"Stronachs are delighted to be associated with this long established charity and the services they provide to the blind and deaf communities, and are looking forward to being part of a fantastic launch event.\"Tickets for the Ball are still available for those who would like to join the guest list.

In  he established his own consultancy business to focus on ruminant mineral nutrition working alongside veterinary practices and livestock farmers.“The correct balance of minerals is important and knowing all the sources of minerals on farm is a key element of maximising livestock performance from grazed grass,” said Mr Bone.Emily Grant, Knowledge Transfer Specialist with QMS commented: “I’m delighted that we have Fiona and Peter coming to speak at the Inverurie Better Grazing meeting.“Minerals play an important role in livestock production, but it’s not an exact science. A shortage, and in some cases an excess of minerals can have a negative effect on production. Supply from pasture can also y through the season, as can livestock requirements.She added: “Fiona and Peter are both enthusiastic and engaging presenters with a great reputation of being able to communicate complex issues in an easily understandable way. I would urge farmers looking to gain a little more insight in to minerals, and how to make the most of them, to attend this meeting.”Now its third year, the main objective of the QMS Better Grazing Groups is to improve livestock producers’ profitability through the better use of grazed grass.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Sandy Reid with PC Laura Fairbairn and PD Ava\"  North East Dog Unit celebrates th anniversary viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The free “Better Grazing” meeting will begin at am and finish at pm and lunch will be provided.Places at this meeting can be reserved on the Eventbrite booking website, or by contacting QMS direct on    or emailing info@qmscotland."},{"url":null,"title":"house plan approved at oldmeldrum","story":"The future of Oldmeldrum Golf Club has been secured thanks to councillors at the Formartine Area Committee.Plans to build a single house on land at the golf course went before councillors on Tuesday, January .The site in question is located directly behind an existing house next to the A and A junction.It is currently used for turf growing, but it had been classed as “obsolete” as it is cheaper for the Golf Club to buy new turfcompared to the man hours needed to maintain and cut their own.The planning application received a total of  representations, all of which were in support of the idea.However in a report put to councillors ahead of the meeting, council planners recommended that the plan be refused as the land had never been developed, and that the development itself was contrary to policy in the Aberdeenshire Local Development Plan.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the club, Patricia Ramsay said that it is currently facing financial dficulties and the debt that it has is preventing the club from moving forward.She added: “The sale of this unused piece of land is the only way of raising much needed funds.“This would be a leline to this community asset.”After discussing the plan, councillor Paul Johnston suggested that the plans be approved with a delegated grant, and his decision was backed by councillor Karen Adam.Cllr Johnston said: “We have to think about the public circumstances, this is a private club but should it have to wind up, that would have a knock-on effect in the local community.”The proposal went to a vote and seven councillors backed the plan with just one vote against it.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Fyvie Castle is taking part in this years Scottish Snowdrop Festival \"  \"  The magic of snowdrops s to AberdeenshireviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Brothers Guy and Mungo Finlayson also organise the Banchory and Inverurie Beer Festivals\"  Festival to bring Scottish Gin to town viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"ice cream parlour to go orange for charity","story":"Mackie#s of Scotland will colour their most popular flavour, known as #Traditional#, bright orange on Friday, February , to raise awareness and money for charity.Mackie’s ., their Aberdeen ice cream parlour, will be a bright vision with orange lighting, balloons and staff dressed in orange T-shirts for Muscular Dystrophy UK.Even the company’s logo will be converted to an orange spotted cow for the day.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Wednesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March. That would involve around  m x mm larch planks.

This is the typical fate of the speaker of Glasgow Scots, the Glaswegian dialect of the Scots language. These prejudices have contributed to a complex pattern of ‘code-switching’ in which a speaker might use Scots with friends, but move along a language continuum towards Scottish Standard English when in a classroom, a job interview or talking on the phone.You could imagine newcomers to the city and country struggling to navigate this linguistic quicksand. ‘Yes’ and ‘aye’ are commonly used in the city, but pinning down precisely where, when and how to use one over the other would be a tricky lesson to teach, let alone assimilate into practise. Yet according to a recent study by Dr Sadie Ryan of Glasgow University, young migrants to the city are adopting not only elements of the Scots language, but are quickly learning how to code-switch like native speakers based on their audience.Dr Ryan was first put on to the linguistic challenges migrants to Glasgow faced when working with asylum seekers. They were studying English textbooks but very quickly realising that the patterns explained in the book were not those being spoken outside. “Words like ‘aye’ and ‘cannae’ were common in the streets outside but went unexplained in the textbook,” she said.To investigate the ways in which young migrants adapt to this linguistic environment, Dr Ryan went to a high school in the East End of Glasgow. It is a working-class area that until very recently had low immigration and a close-knit linguistic community which had sustained a relatively dense Scots lexis in common usage. Since the expansion of the EU in , the area has seen a marked increase in migration from Eastern Europe, with concomitant impact on the demographics in the classroom.: Pupils to be taught Scots language in bid to improve attainmentThe study looked at language, and also specically at code-switching. This is something we as Scots do all the time, ying our accent and vocabulary to match with our perception of what is ‘proper’ for each situation.To gain insight into code-switching, the kids were recorded in three dferent social situations to see how they responded linguistically to dferent listeners. An after-school club was set up, where the kids were free to play and joke with their pals. They did loads of activities like drums, make-up, arts and crafts. They were equipped with headset mics to capture the audio. Then they were recorded in conversation with Dr Ryan, a more formal setting. Finally, they were recorded in the classroom doing school work.The Glasgow Scots features Dr Ryan was looking out for were things such as Scots negation. That is words such as cannae, wilnae, dinnae, didnae, saying “I’m no daein that” as the equivalent of the standard English “I’m not doing that”. Dr Ryan was also looking at glottal stops. This feature – the ‘dropping’ of the t in the middle of words – is actually fairly complex. “Although people can see it as an absence, it involves the contraction of the vocal cords to create a distinct sound, so is better seen as alternation between dferent sounds. Its use too is complex. It can only replace t-sounds when they occur in very specic places in speech, yet no language learning textbook will tell you which places it can occur in.”The results from the after-school club were interesting. When wearing a mic, the kids would spend five minutes tearing about, putting on funny voices and kidding on they were American. When they began to settle down, however, it was clear that, amongst themselves, these young immigrant and Glasgow-born kids, living and learning together in a working-class part of Glasgow, were using Glasgow Scots features regularly in their conversations. Regardless of the country of birth of the children, Scots negation and glottal stops were common.The after-school club also revealed examples of the newcomer pupils’ mother tongues contributing to the linguistic repertoire of the group. For example, a wee guy with a Polish girlfriend had learned “I love you” in Polish. And a group of pals – Polish, Lithuanian and Scottish – would use bits of Scots, bits of Polish, bits of Scottish Standard English to communicate. Dr Ryan witnessed during this part of the study a lot of effort from the Glaswegian-born kids to integrate with and welcome the newcomers, which is great to hear.The second and third parts of the study – the interviews and the recordings made in the classroom setting held with the pupils – were also revelatory. The ability of non-Scottish born pupils to code-switch between Scots and Scottish Standard English was as good as their Scottish-born classmates.: Do you know these  Scots words and phrases Conversations with pupils of ious backgrounds revealed that they saw the Scots words as being ‘slang’. For example, saying ‘aye’ is the slang for ‘yes’. This is less positive news as it does seem to indicate that prejudices about the Scots language are being transmitted along with its vocabulary and usage.The Scots language is spoken by around . million people, according to the  census, yet bizarrely it has little or no place in many schools outside of Burns Week. The impact of this lack of legitimacy in school is perhaps seen in the attitudes of the pupils learning and using the words who see it as of lower status. Dr Ryan saw pupils with negative perceptions of their own voice, with one saying “I wish I had a dferent accent” and another that “we don’t really speak proper round here”.This study has revealed that Scots plays an important role in the social integration of newcomers into the school environment. It is also playing a role in identity formation.As this is the  United Nations Year of Indigenous Languages, it is a great time to reassess and improve our national relationship with the Scots language. Excellent studies like that conducted by Dr Ryan can reveal the importance of Scots to our identity and its centrality in our everyday communication. It would be a positive to investigate further the role of Scots in social integration and look at ways to use it to boost linguistic confidence both in and out of the classroom.More positive still would be for us just to learn to speak it with confidence ourselves, to take away the strange cringe or shame some of us have about these native words, this language o oor national bard an the language o oor scuils the day.

This time it is whether or not the government’s motion on its Plan B for Brexit, up for discussion tomorrow, will be successfully altered by an amendment lodged by Labour Remainer Yvette Cooper. If passed the effect will be to give Parliament the power to bring forward a proposal to extend Article  for possibly three months – even until the end of this year.Whatever the outcome, the fact is thatthe UK is to leave the EU with a transitional arrangement then something needs to give for Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to become acceptable or it will not be passed. With Parliament having invoked Article  of the Lisbon Treaty and passed the Withdrawal Act the existing law is simple. If there is no alternative procedure made law then the United Kingdom leaves at pm on  March and immediately becomes a sovereign country again, trading under World Trade Organisation rules rather than EU regulations on a supposed temporary basis.Last week was notable for a number of statements from all sides seeking to find agreement that might deliver the referendum result – even before Her Majesty suggested the importance of establishing common ground. First Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson, who have been appealing for the Prime Minister and her Cabinet to stick to past commitments, indicated they could be willing to support her Withdrawal Agreementshe can get the EU to time-limit or even delete the ‘backstop’. Given there is a great deal more wrong with the Prime Minister’s proposal than just the backstop this was a generous concession. Their real concern is that without finding some consensus Brexit will never happen. Yet, as the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, demonstrated on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, a compromise on the backstop will not come from the Irish Republic. To win such a prize would therefore require the EU having to hang out Ireland – either by agreeing to previously dismissed technical solutions it has insisted are unworkable or by moving the ‘border’ to the continental mainland such as the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge . Irish politicians have every right to be worried about being hung out to dry following statements from the EU’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas and then its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Schinas caught the Irish by surprise and set hares running by stating at a media briefing there would indeed be a “hard border” between the Republic and the UKno transition arrangement could be agreed. This was completely at odds with what EU Commission President Jean Claude Junker had said when last visiting Dublin. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was then reported as suggesting a risk that the EU might choose to locate border checks away from the Irish border and to the French and Dutch ports, thus treating the UK and Ireland as a single block. For those believing it could never happen the example of Ireland and the UK being outside the Schengen Area and therefore sharing joint security and passport checks provides a dose of reality.Varadkar was not finished, for when pressed on the border issue later in Davos he claimed Irish police or even the army would have to man any hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If the comment was designed to panic the UK government into concessions it was a misjudgment for the response was, as it has consistently been, that the UK would not install or operate any physical border infrastructure or controls. It is only the EU and Irish politicians who are now talking about physical infrastructure. What they misunderstandis not that Brexit-supporting Unionists say there will be no border, they say there is indeed a border already for many thingsbut it is essentially invisible and should remain so.If the UK ends up trading under WTO rules, using the past experience and already existing technology means we shall be able to work invisibly for trade, even including animals and foodstuffs, by managing any checks before and after the border – just as already happens in other parts of Europe. That Varadkar, Coveney, Barnier – and British politicians who support remain – cannot admit to recognising solutions exist, when an endless number of papers and articles have been produced showing how an invisible trade border can work, suggests they either choose to remain ignorant or are intentionally mendacious.What is also missed is that existing EU regulations are not impervious to fraud and deceit and cannot be bettered. Such arrogance and complacency was exposed as dangerously naïve during the  Irish horsemeat scandal, when some Irish-made burgers were found to have up to  per cent horsemeat in them when labelled as pure beef.The problem with Cooper’s amendment remains that delaying the departure date for Brexit will not in itself make arriving at an agreement on the border or other obstacles any more likely. MPs shall simply be taking the pressure off both themselves and the EU and end up with nothing much happening for the next three months – ing to a flurry of brinkmanship and suggested compromises as the clock ticks down again to pm on say,  June or even the end of December. We thus have two paradoxes. The first is how the backstop insisted upon by EU and Irish politicians to avoid an imagined hard border is now proving to be the most likely cause of the UK leaving the EU without a transition agreement – so a hard border is delivered. The second is that the approach of the last few days and hours of time left for negotiation – before the UK concedes there will be no agreement and WTO trading rules must be put in place as the expected outcome – is what is resulting in a drive by all parties to find a solution. Take the imperative of the clock ticking down removes the pressure to find a solution.Yvette Cooper’s amendment needs to be rejected and the focus of politicians on all sides shouldto improving the Withdrawal Agreement so that it becomes acceptable to all parties – or acknowledging it will indeed be a very bad deal the UK cannot work with and instead move to improve the circumstances for leaving the EU without a transition agreement.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864410.1548782208!/image/image.jpg","title":"criticism as snp politician poised to head up botched alex salmond inquiry","story":"An SNP politician is poised to head up an inquiry into the Scottish Government#s botched handling of complaints against former First Minister Alex Salmond.Opposition parties have hit out after the Nationalists declined to hand over the convenorship of an ad hoc Holyrood committee which will look into the issue.The taxpayer was left with a legal bill of £, after Salmond successfully won a judicial review at the Court of Session into the procedures used by the Government he once led to investigate complaints made against him.A series of privatemeetings between Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Salmond while the probe was underway will be at the heart of the deliberations and opposition parties had suggested that the SNP should not head it up. - Nicola Sturgeon spokesman: Vote up budget or face wrath of ordinary ScotsBut a meeting of the ScottishParliament business bureau today saw the SNP hold firm on the issue.A Parliament spokeswoman said: “Bureau members unanimously agreed to the establishment of a  person committee, convened by a member of the SNP with the Deputy Convener coming from the Conservative Party. The Bureau will finalise issues around remit and membership at its next meeting.” Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden welcomed the creation of the committee.But he said: “We are disappointed the SNP has refused to forfeit convenership of a committee probing issues which have occurred within its own party.“There will be further opportunities in coming weeks for the nationalists to reconsider this move, and voters will expect them to do exactly that.”Labour Business Manager Neil Findlay had arguedagainst the SNP chairing the committee during the meeting, but said he did not want to block the committee being established.“It is now a matter for the SNP to decideit thinks chairing the committee is appropriate - ultimately the election of a convener is a matter for the committee so the option is still open for an MSP from an opposition partyto chair the committee,” he said.All partiesunanimously agreed to the establishment of this committee and its remit and timescale are now being finalised. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: “We have previously suggested that the SNP should consider stepping aside from chairing this committee. However, it is now up to them to put forward a convenor who can command the respect of parliament.“This committee will address the concerns that have arisen over the actions of the First Minister, her advisers and officials.

To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

BACKGROUND: ScotRail passenger satisfaction slumps to %Satisfaction with Virgin Trains was  per cent, LNER  per cent, CrossCountry  per cent, although TransPennine Express was even lower than ScotRails at  per cent.In the latest survey, among , passengers, the biggest fall was in how useful passengers found information about delays, down  points to  per cent.How well ScotRail dealt with delays - traditionally the firms Achilles heel in the poll - was down by  points to  per cent, with only  per cent of commuters happy.Passengers were also increasingly unhappy with connections with other trains - down  points to  per cent.Their satisfaction with punctuality and reliability also fell by ten points to  per cent, and was only  per cent on most commuter lines into Edinburgh but  per cent on inter-city routes.Satisfaction with ticket price value for money fell eight points to  per cent, but it was just  per cent on most commuter lines into Edinburgh and  per cent among commuters.However, there were improvements in some areas, with cycle parking up  points to  per cent.Satisfaction with levels of crowding on trains improved by three points to  per cent, but it was  per cent on most commuter lines into Edinburgh and  per cent among of commuters.There are also signs ScotRails performance is improving with no planned cancellations today for the fth day in a row.Transport Focus director David Sidebottom said: ldquoScotRail and Network Rail need to keep to their basic promises and deliver a relentless focus on day-to-day performance as well as better information during disruption.\"A better value for money and more reliable railway must arrive soon for passengers.\"While services have fallen well short of what passengers deserve, ScotRailrsquos extra compensation is welcome and will go some way to rebuild passenger trust.He said Transport Focus would \"continue to monitor closely whether the introduction of the new timetable delivers additional capacity, more frequent trains and better journey times for passengers - and whether the remedial notice issued to ScotRail by Transport Scotland will result in a plan that delivers improved punctuality and reliability\".BACKGROUND: ScotRail performance officially improves despite hundreds of cancelled trainsScottish Labour transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ldquoIt is little surprise that passenger satisfaction with ScotRail has plummeted after months of delays, cancellations and overcrowding on our trains.ldquoInfor this shoddy service, hard-pressed commuters are being forced to fork out even more to travel on our trains with a rip-off fare rise given the green light by the SNP government,who ignored calls for a fare freeze in the Budget.ldquoSNP transport secretary Michael Matheson has allowed [ScotRail operator] Abellio to miss target after target and then teamed up with the Tories to block Labourrsquos plans to bring our railways into public ownership.ldquoThe SNP should use the current Budget process to deliver a fare cut for passengers and back Labourrsquos call for public ownership of our railways so we have a transport system that works for the many.Scottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said: ldquoScotRail services have gone from bad to worse in recent months, with delays and cancellations becoming commonplace.\"These figures, the worst customer satisfaction stats in many years, should come as a wake-up call to the transport secretary, who must now strip Abellio of the franchise and put in place a public operator at the earliest opportunity.A spokesperson for the Scottish Governments Transport Scotland agency said: \"ScotRailrsquos performance hasnrsquot been good enough ndash thatrsquos undeniable and these results quite clearly underline the need for sustainable improvements.\"We have taken the serious contractual step of issuing a remedial plan notice for the high level of cancellations and performance which are inextricably linked to passengersrsquo views.\"We are already taking further action to ensure ScotRail implement measures to swtly address these latest unacceptable results.\"ScotRail said the survey - made between September and November - had coincided with \"challenging\" autumn weather.It also said its  per cent rating was the same as the average among other train operators in the survey.However, the poll was completed before huge disruption from ScotRail cancellations due to the late delivery of new trains, which could have made its results even worse.In an effort to highlight positive findings from the survey, ScotRail said satisfaction levels among leisure travellers, its \"largest customer group\", were at its highest level since spring  at  per cent.It also pointed to satisfaction with ticket-buying facilities increasing by five points, which followed the installation of new ticket machines and smartcard technology.ScotRail suggested major improvements to cope with record and rising passenger numbers, such as at Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley, may have influenced the results.Phil Campbell, ScotRails head of customer operations, said: ldquoWhile itrsquos good news that four out of five of our customers are satisfied with ScotRail, we know there is much more to do given the challenges we have faced in recent months.ldquoEveryone at ScotRail is working flat out to deliver the improved service our customers expect and deserve.A spokesperson for Virgin Trains,.whose score was down one point, said: ldquoWe have consistently outperformed the long-distance franchised sector for customer satisfaction and this year is no exception with  per cent of customers saying they liked our service, seven percentage points above the sector average.\"Wersquoll continue to focus on delivering great customer service and to introduce industry leading innovations such as digital ticketing and scrapping peak restrictions on Fridays.FULL SURVEY REPORT AND FIGURESDavid Horne, managing director of LNER, which took over Scotland-London trains on the east coast main line from Virgin Trains East Coast, said: ldquoIt has been an incredibly busy time since LNER launched back in June.\"We have worked hard to provide a seamless transition for our customers and have since focused on identying how we can start to further improve the experience of people travelling with us.A big part of this has been about continuing to get the basics right so wersquore really pleased to see that our overall satisfaction score has remained above the average for our sector.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864469.1548790933!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit house of commons vote to reject labour amendment","story":"The House of Commons has rejected a bid by Jeremy Corbyn to force a debate on Labour#s Brexit plans.Mr Corbyn’s call for more time to be given for MPs to consider alternatives to the Brexit deal was the first in a series of amendments being put to the vote on Tuesday evening.Prime Minister Theresa May made a plea to MPs to give her a “mandate” to reopen negotiations with Brussels by backing a proposal from Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady, which calls for the controversial backstop to be replaced by “alternative arrangements” to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.The chances of the Brady amendment succeeding were boosted when hardline Eurosceptics in the backbench European Research Group announced they would support it.But Mrs May’s hopes of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement struck with the EU last November were dealt a blow by French President Emmanuel Macron, who described it as “not renegotiable”.Speaking in Cyprus moments before MPs voted, Mr Macron said: “As the European Council in December clearly indicated, the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK and EU is the best agreement possible.“It is not renegotiable.”Mr Macron called on Mrs May to present the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier with her next steps for avoiding a no-deal Brexit on March , which he said “no-one wants, but ... we must all, despite everything, prepare for”.Mr Corbyn’s amendment was defeated by  votes to , with MPs thought to have voted broadly along party lines.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future. Failure to encourage and embrace that potential would be reckless and irresponsible.In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.Our children and new generations deserve a future better than the past which we endured. I wouldn’t have believed you, had you said a few short months ago that my small club [Naomh Éanna] would be in an All-Ireland final in two weeks time, but the unexpected can overtake events.I have seen how history and identity, timing and preparation and the taking of opportunity can reshape history and positively define and improve lives.Tapaidh an déis.

It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exiled puigdemont wants catalan to become independent state in the eu","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

of a proposal which called on the NI Policing Board to provide additional resources for Derry police in wake of the recent bomb attack.The motion was put forward by UUP Alderman Derek Hussey which stated the ‘council are mindful of the need for increased resources to the PSNI to frustrate and eliminate the criminality currently being perpetrated on our citizens throughout the district and therefore call on the Chief Constable, Policing Board and Secretary of State to address the present deficit.’It was seconded by his party colleague, Alderman Mary Hamilton.Cllr Hussey said what happened was ‘absolutely scandalous’ and an attack on ‘citizens and the economy of the area’.  It placed the police service under ‘tremendous pressure’ and removed officers from ‘other duties’, he added.He urged the council to call on the Chief Constable and others to address ‘the obvious deficit in resources’.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshGary Donnelly, Independent Councillor for The Moor, asked for a legal opinion, saying an earlier motion had been passed which condemned ‘all violence’ yet Cllr Hussey’s proposal was in support ‘of one of the groups responsible for violence’.  This week, he said, the PSNI has carried out a ‘large number of violent and destructive house raids’ which have also affected ‘vulnerable people’ and those arrested who had ‘no evidence put to them’.Sinn Féin Councillor and former Mayor, Maoliosa McHugh, said it was a matter for the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, to raise these matters and ensure there is an acceptable level of policing in the community.  He and his party members could accept the motion, he explained, but said they were totally opposed to police violence towards members of the community as ‘that type of reaction by the state gave rise to violence in this country’.Cllr McHugh said he would agree with additional resourcesrequired but added that there are ‘many areas’ which require extra funding at present.Alderman Drew Thompson, DUP, told the meeting he had met with the Chief Constable since the Bishop Street bomb and would ‘certainly support’ this motion.After further discussion Cllr Hussey’s motion was carried, thirty-three councillors voted in favour but all Independent councillors voted against or abstained."},{"url":null,"title":"purchase foyle college lands marks milestone magee university expansion","story":"Ulster University has confirmed the purchase of Foyle College lands in Derry which will allow for future development of the Magee campus.It was expected that Ulster University would buy lands at the Duncreggan Road site when Foyle College relocated to its £.m Limavady Road site last year, however, the deal has experienced delays.The local community and politicians are optimistic that this will pave the way for long-awaited expansion at the Magee Campus which has seen a drop in student numbers and courses cut in recent years rather than growth.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend an Ulster University spokesperson confirmed that the deal included both the lands on the Duncreggan Road and playing fields opposite the old Foyle College junior school on the Northland Road.She added: “Ulster University has completed its purchase of the Foyle College lands, marking a milestone in the development and expansion opportunities for Magee campus.“The purchase follows the opening last year of the £m state-of-the-art teaching centre at the heart of the Magee campus, which has already enhanced the vibrancy of campus le and paved the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.“Options for the Foyle College lands will now be explored in line with the University’s plans for growth of the Magee campus and its wider estates strategy.”Sinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has

university.  This land will be allow for the continued expansion of Magee.\"The key stakeholders involved have been working on the acquisition of this land for some time and I welcome the fact that it has now been completed.\"I will also be convening a meeting of all parties to meet with the permanent secretary of the Department of Health to discuss the plans for the establishment of a medical school at Magee.\"This is part of the wider plans for the growth and expansion of Magee which will provide more opportunities for young people and assist the development of a new, vibrant economy in the north west.\"Meanwhile, SDLP Councillor Sinead McLaughlin commented: \"This is a very important milestone as it reaffirms Ulster University’s commitment to the further expansion of the Magee Campus. The growth and development of the higher education provision within the North West region remains a political priority for our party as the university is a key driver for growing a vibrant regional economy.\"A key component of the University Growth Plan is the establishment of a Postgraduate Medical School. SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood, has expressed his commitment to join a cross-party group to meet with the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health to ensure that the Medical School gets approval

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder.

Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Most important of all, the Conservative Party united to support an amendment that sought legally binding change to the Irish border backstop.This of course does not mean that there will be such change, or indeed that there will be any movement at all from the European Union. It does not even mean that further legislation to enact an amended Withdrawal Agreement would in fact pass both houses of Parliament eventhe EU did so agree.The signicance, however, lies in the fact that the government has not disintegrated as at times in recent months it has seemed it might, via a schism in the Conservative Party.The broad bulk of Tory MPs, including firm supporters of Remain as well as hardcore Brexiteers, supported Graham Brady’s motion, as did the DUP’s  MPs.The EU was swt in its dismissal of any change to the Withdrawal Agreement, but there have clearly been small cracks in recent weeks that betray a firm desire for a deal on the part of much of the Brussels establishment. No longer can it be said that the UK does not have a position that it can endorse and pass — it now does. Northern Ireland is in the remarkable situation that its land border is now the chief obstacle to the UK leaving the EU in an orderly fashion. That is a perilous situation for unionists to be in. At any moment, a majority at Westminster could cut us adrt. Theresa May’s foolish acceptance of the backstop in late , despite depending on DUP votes, illustrated that.Now though the backstop is in peril.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices.

Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
