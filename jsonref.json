I do think that if two blokes had gone to a game a decade ago, they’d just talk about the football.

A big moment for Carlsen, who now must choose which exchange to give up. The champion play 20. Rb1!?, which the computers hate! Nepomniachtchi captures the bishop (20. ... Nbxc1) and consolidates his clear pawn advantage after (21. Rbxc1 Nxc1 22. Rxc1 Rb8). Carlsen is back on the clock, more than 12 minutes behind the challenger with 44 minutes to make 18 moves. Carlsen is back on the clock now and the engines indicate he must play Nd6. Carlsen, who’s slipped behind his opponent on the clock, answers with 17. Ne5. A very sharp position, this. The Norwegian supercomputer Sesse evaluates the position as dead even ... but any response but Bxe5 by the challenger will give Carlsen an overwhelming advantage. “Kind of a hard choice here for Ian and Magnus still very much in book,” the Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri says on Chess24’s broadcast. “(Carlsen) knows all the options in this position. I feel really, really worried for Ian. I think if he survives this game, it’s going be a huge achievement and a huge relief for him and his team.”The time control for each game is 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, 60 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61. If the match is tied after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day (16 December) in the following order: • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner. Notably, Carlsen’s second and third title defenses both came down to tiebreakers. But many believe the increased length of this year’s match (from 12 to 14 games) and the stylistic matchup at hand promises a decisive result in regulation.For those of you just coming aboard, Carlsen, 30, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April with a round to spare. It’s the culmination of a rivalry that started nearly two decades ago when they first met across the board as boys at the 2002 European Under-12 Championship in Peniscola, Spain. Notably, Nepomniachtchi enters the title tilt with a winning lifetime record against Carlsen in classical matches (four won, one lost and eight drawn). That makes him unique among today’s top players, even if two of those victories came in youth championships. We’re about a half hour from today’s first move, so not much longer now. In the meantime here’s our Sean Ingle’s interview with Carlsen from earlier this week.

The latest figures take the total number of fatalities in the country of 5.7 million people to 690.Following fresh advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), from 4am on Sunday Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will join the red list. Travellers who have returned from these four countries in the last 10 days must isolate and get a PCR test, officials said.  understands the UKHSA is now following up recent arrivals from these countries. Ministers are not ruling out adding further countries to the red list. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said:  From 4am on Sunday non-UK and Irish residents who have been in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England, officials said. This does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through any of these countries while changing flights. UK and Irish residents arriving from 4am on Sunday must isolate in a government-approved facility for 10 days. During their stay, they will be required to take a PCR test on day 2 and day 8. South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia were added to the red list on Thursday and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from 4am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a government-approved hotel quarantine for 10 days.Boris Johnson is due to take part in a news conference at 5pm with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, “to set out further measures”. When asked what the public’s response should be, Javid replied: Sajid Javid, the UK health secretary, said:  The iniduals that have tested positive, and all members of their households, are being retested and told to self-isolate while further testing and contact tracing is under way, officials said. One case has been located in Chelmsford and the other in Nottingham. The two cases are linked, officials said, and there is a link to travel to southern Africa. The UKHSA is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious. Sajid Javid said the two iniduals are now self-isolating and the cases are connected. He added there would be targeted testing in the areas where the cases were found – in Chelmsford and Nottingham. The foreign ministry made the statement as countries around the world rushed to impose travel bans from southern African countries. “Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,” it said. The bans on flights was said to be “akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker”.Dr Zubaida Haque called on the government to take “early and preventative action now”, saying “high cases and no mitigations means spread of new variant is faster”. Meanwhile, Prof Susan Michie and Dr Kit Yates have thrown their weight behind Prof Stephen Reicher “debunking the idea of behavioural fatigue”. “The evidence is that people respond to clear leadership from trusted sources,” Michie said. Advocating for a policy of elimination, Dr Deepti Gurdasani stressed that “with every shift in the virus we risk dealing with a shift in the pandemic”. “Progressive coordinated and supported global elimination was the only way to really deal with this threat. And with every new variant, it gets harder to do this,” she said.  Gurdasani said a lack of mandatory hotel quarantine in the UK means “spread can happen in households and onward” and called for comprehensive mandatory border quarantines from all regions, mask mandates, mitigations in schools and limits on large gatherings. She also urged the booster programme and vaccine drive for children to be accelerated.The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said the suspected infection was a woman who stayed in Namibia, and then flew home via South Africa and Dubai. This is Harry Taylor, bringing you Covid news for the next hour.Among the key points to look for are the variant’s epidemiology, its clinical impact and how it fares under existing public health measures. Farrar adds: “The emergence of a new Covid-19 variant with all its myriad mutations – on this occasion from South Africa – is not unexpected,” said Dr Osman Dar, the project director of Chatham House’s One Health Project and a specialist in public health and the control of communicable diseases.  African states will pay the price of travel bans which are implemented to try to contain the spread of Omicron, while drug companies will benefit from the search for modified vaccines, he added.  Dutch health authorities said the positive cases were being quarantined in a hotel near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. “We now know that 61 of the results were positive and 531 negative,” the Dutch health authority (GGD) said in a statement. “The positive test results will be examined as soon as possible to determine whether this concerns the new worrisome variant, which has since been given the name Omicron variant.” Those who tested positive will be required to stay in hotel quarantine for seven days if they show symptoms and for five days if they do not. Those who test negative are expected to isolate at home.  The Dutch government had banned all air travel from South Africa early on Friday because of concerns about the Omicron variant. Testing is required before flights. Around 600 passengers arrived at Schiphol on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing. The passengers from the two aircraft, which landed shortly after each other, were kept separate from other people at the airport, De Telegraaf reports. One aircraft came from Cape Town and landed at Schiphol around 10.30 am on Friday. The other flight, from Johannesburg, arrived at around 11am. Some people complained about the lack of information from airport officials and said it took seven hours before they were given anything to eat or drink.  Lorraine Blaauw, who runs a support group for South African families in the Netherlands, told DutchNews.nl she had been contacted by several people onboard the two flights. “It was chaos,” she said. “No one knew what was going on. There was no food, no milk for the babies. KLM provided 30 blankets for 600 people. The KLM crew just went home.” The Kennemerland health board, which is responsible for testing at the airport, said it understood the frustration under passengers about the situation. “People who have just had a long journey … were confronted with a situation we have never had to deal with before,” the health board said in a statement.“Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South Africa,” tweeted Kai Klose, the minister of state for social affairs and integration in the western German state of Hesse. The full sequencing of the variant hasn’t yet been carried out, but he said health authorities had a “high level of suspicion” that the person has contracted the variant. The traveller has been isolated at home.  If confirmed, it would be the first case of Omicron in Germany. No further details were given about the passenger or which airport the infected person arrived at. Frankfurt international airport, Germany’s busiest airport, is located in the state of Hesse. “If you have returned from southern Africa in the last week, limit your contacts and get tested,” Klose warned."},{"url":null,"title":"how safe are our primary schools amid latest covid wave","story":" Matt Melvin, principal at St Etchen’s National School in Kinegad, Co Westmeath, where he has had to step in as a teacher, an SNA and a bus escort on various days this week. Photograph: Alan BetsonJohn Weir, the principal of St Mary’s Parish Primary School in Bryanstown in Drogheda, Co Louth, is looking through the school’s roll book. He can’t remember a time when so many children and staff were out of school.“We’ve seen a massive spike in Covid cases in recent times,” he says. “In some classes there has been close to 50 per cent attendance . . . There are Covid cases, precautionary absences, children waiting on tests, other illnesses. For others, we just don’t know until mum or dad tells us.”Overall, the school has averaged an overall non-attendance rate of about 15 per cent for November, significantly higher than normal.“We’re doing everything to minimise the spread within the school with the prevention measures, but the hard part is keeping it out of the school . . . Many parents are confused about when they can and can’t send their children into school. The guidance is being constantly updated.”The school, he says, has managed to limit transmission within pods to a few cases by acting swiftly when positive cases have been identified, but it feels like a constant battle. The mantra from Government that “schools are safe” doesn’t wash with him.“These children are the only unvaccinated group left in society. Children are in rooms with 28 others for six or seven hours a day. You’re dealing with unmasked children. So, it’s very hard to see that they are ‘safe’.”Highest infectionLatest figures released this week show that primary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group, with some 10,000 positive cases in the past fortnight.A report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) notes that the infection rate for primary school-aged children has been rising since mid-October.Many schools have been struggling to keep classes open due to staff shortages linked to high rates of sick leave or teachers being forced to self-isolate due to the virus. Tens of thousands of primary children nationally are estimated to be out of school as well.The scale of the infection rate among young people has prompted urgent questions about how safe primary schools really are.Are risk mitigation measures such as handwashing, opening windows and – potentially – face masks for the over-9s enough to combat the spread of the virus?In primary school staff rooms this week, rumours once again swirled around circuit-breakers and potential school closures.Remarks by Dr Ronan Glynn – the State’s deputy chief medical officer – that “schools are not as safe now as they were” seemed to back up many teachers’ long-standing concerns.The country’s largest primary teachers’ union, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO), earlier this week warned that the system that was “creaking at the seams” and that teachers had been “abandoned”.However, public health experts are convinced schools remain a low risk for transmission of the disease.They have briefed the Government that most of the infection among children is coming from parents, household contacts and the community, rather than within schools.The latest HPSC report, for example, says increases in the virus among pre-school and primary-aged children have been broadly consistent with increases across other age groups since mid-October.“The risk of onward transmission from undetected asymptomatic cases within the school setting remains low,” it states.RiskDr Abigail Collins, consultant in public health medicine and the HSE’s clinical lead on child health, endorses this. When asked if schools are “safe”, she says public health experts tend to avoid such terms.“We deal with risk assessment. With the right measures in place – such as keeping those with symptoms away from school and having infection controls in place – schools are low risk settings for onward spread of Covid-19,” says Dr Collins.If schools really are such a low risk, why have the Covid-19 rates among five- to 12-year-olds trebled in the last two months?Dr Collins points to a number of factors at play. If there is a high incidence of cases in the wider society, children will get it too via household or community transmission, she says.Children are also the only remaining unvaccinated group in the population. In addition, she says, children tend to get tested more, because there is a strong motivation for parents to do so.“Even now, the proportion of primary children testing positive is quite stable. The numbers are going up for all age groups . . . Are schools or classrooms amplification settings? It’s not what we’re seeing or experiencing.”She points to trends in coronavirus data since schools reopened in September to illustrate the point.Positive cases among children rose in early September when schools reopened, but stabilised and fell a few weeks later.This rise, she says, was likely the result of a major spike in testing which detected asymptomatic cases that would not have been picked up otherwise.Dr Collins says cases only began to rise significantly among primary school children into October when society began to fully reopen.“You can see on the graphs that the adult cases went up, followed by children a little bit afterwards. That’s not a surprise. Children are part of the community. If there are high numbers in the community, there will be high numbers among children.”ScepticalMany principals and teachers, however, are sceptical about official coronavirus figures and have a nagging suspicion that school cases are not being properly recorded.John Boyle of the INTO claims the removal of routine testing and tracing from schools in late September has concealed the escalation of positive case numbers among pupils and staff in primary schools.“It simply cannot be a coincidence that the number of five- to 12-year-old children contracting the virus has trebled since crucial public health supports were removed from the primary sector less than two months ago, abandoning teachers and principals to protect themselves and their unmasked, unvaccinated pupils from the impact of the highest wave of infection in their schools since the pandemic began,” Mr Boyle says.Some principals and teachers also point to official HPSC figures on outbreaks in schools to bolster their case: under the old testing and tracing regime, up to 90 outbreaks were being detected in a single week during in September.Yet last week, without routine contact tracing in schools, just 24 outbreaks were detected.Dr Collins accepts that public health authorities do not have the same level of oversight or visibility of outbreaks than they did under the old testing and tracing regime.However, she says that in outbreaks where there is a public health response, the majority involve just a handful of cases.Where there are high-profile examples of major outbreaks in schools, she says, they tend to have their origin in events outside school which a cluster of children or families have attended, such as a party or event.“Society has opened up . . . That’s not anyone’s fault, but this is what drives transmission,” she says.The other major risk is a Covid-positive child or staff member remaining in school, undetected, for a significant period of time.Many principals and teachers say they want a return of contact tracing at primary level, which they believe will make schools safer by being able to hunt down the virus. They are convinced the system was relaxed too early because the system couldn’t cope with the volume of contact tracing required.Dr Collins, however, argues that the system was unfairly leading to the exclusion of thousands of close contacts of positive cases in schools. Low transmission rates meant the vast majority – about 98 per cent – were testing negative.She says authorities are “extremely conscious of the impact that periods of absence from school have on children’s educational, social and emotional well-being”.In any case, she says the usefulness of contact tracing when there are large volumes of cases in the community is “blunted” and public health messaging becomes more important.“So, public health messages such as ensuring that any child with symptoms of Covid-19 – including a new cough, shortness of breath, high temperature, sore throat – self-isolates and gets a PCR test are so important. That is overwhelmingly the most important thing to do right now.”School closuresAs for rumours about schools closing, they are are just that.“There are very clear international recommendations that schools should be the last places to close and the first to reopen. I think a lot would need to close first before that would ever be considered,” she says.Matt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, meanwhile, is focused on getting through the next few weeks to Christmas. It has been a case of all hands on deck in recent times,“I’ve been a teacher, an SNA, a bus escort, a cleaner this week – and a principal,” he says, with a smile.His school has been battling with staff shortages and Covid cases, but he is optimistic for the future.“We’ve had cases in school recently – but schools are only a reflection of society. This is one for wider society to get a grip on,” he says.At St Etchen’s, he says, the risk mitigation measures seem to be working: keeping windows open, limiting pupils to pods and using carbon dioxide monitors.“We’re not seeing transmission within school, but we’ve had cases. The children are very compliant. They wash their hands, they stay in their pods and they’ll wear face masks if required,”he says.“They keep an eye on the carbon dioxide monitors and if they go orange, we go out for 10 minutes . . . As far as I’m concerned, the school is calm, secure and safe. The children through this have been great.

But the gap between our positions is still significant and we are ready to use Article 16 to protect the Belfast Agreement if other solutions cannot be found,” Mr Frost said in a statement after meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London on Friday.“A decisive push is needed to ensure predictability,” Mr Sefcovic said on Twitter after the meeting with Mr Frost. “We’ll meet again next week.” The two sides are seeking to break the deadlock over the implementation of the protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. EU and Irish officials had been concerned that the British government was moving towards triggering Article 16 earlier this month, but momentum appeared to dissipate as the EU warned it would have a severe impact on trade and UK prime minister Boris Johnson faced political trouble at home over a sleaze scandal.Talks between officials from both sides on technical aspects of customs and other arrangements are due to continue throughout the coming week.The EU has been keen to nail down a deal covering medicines, but has found agreement from the UK side to be elusive.There are concerns that time is tight and that a deal on medicines would need to be reached soon in order for the EU to change its laws in time to avoid disruption after the end of this year.A grace period for border checks and regulatory approvals for medicines is due to expire at the end of December and the EU had proposed adjusting its rules to counter any potential disruption to supply.But in order to be in place by the end of the year, the EU had hoped to begin its internal approval procedures in the coming week.Earlier this week, Mr Sefcovic warned that his previously expressed hopes that a deal could be reached before January were “probably too ambitious”.“I think that if there was the clear political will from the UK side these... problems could be solved,” he told Politico. “But looking at how far we progressed over the last four weeks, the level of detail our UK partners want to discuss, I know that we will probably not be able to resolve everything before the end of the year.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Phill MagakoeAFPGettyTwo cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have been detected in the UK, as the government added extra African countries to the travel red list. The iniduals and all members of their households have been ordered to self-isolate after one case was detected in Chelmsford, Essex, and the other in Nottingham. Both cases are believed to be connected and there is a link to southern Africa. Health secretary Sajid Javid said targeted testing is now being carried out, as travel restrictions were set to be introduced for Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. Prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out further measures during a Downing Street press conference later on Saturday.Meanwhile, the first suspected cases of the Omicron Covid variant in Germany and the Czech Republic are being investigated on Saturday as Dutch authorities scramble to see if 61 passengers from South Africa who tested positive for Covid-19 have the new variant.Omicron has been designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and has reached Belgium after being discovered in South Africa. The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the variant has an increased risk of reinfection and may spread more rapidly than other strains.In Germany, a minister in the western state of Hesse said on Saturday that the variant had probably arrived after mutations were found in a passenger arriving from South Africa.“Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South Africa,” tweeted Kai Klose, social affairs minister in Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport, Germany’s biggest hub and one of Europe’s busiest airports.He added that a full sequencing of the variant was being carried out and that the person was isolating, and he urged anyone who had travelled from South Africa in the last few weeks to limit contacts and get tested.The Czech Republic is examining a suspected Omicron case detected in a person who spent time in Namibia. “A lab is checking a possible find of a positive specimen of the Omicron variant. We are awaiting confirmation or refutation of the case,” a spokesperson for the National Institute of Public Health said on Saturday.The emergence of the potentially more contagious variant of Covid-19 has led to many countries implementing travel bans from southern African countries.Joe Biden on Friday confirmed the United States will bar entry to most travellers from eight southern African countries starting on Monday, following similar moves from states in the EU and elsewhere.The restrictions apply to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi. The US travel restrictions do not ban flights or apply to US citizens and lawful US permanent residents.No cases of the Omicron variant were identified in the United States to date, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday. The agency expects that it would quickly identify the variant, also known as B.1.1.529, if it emerges in the country.Thailand also announced a ban on travel from the eight countries, beginning in December, following other Asian countries including Japan in tightening border rules.In the UK, flights were banned from six countries – South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe – which were added to its travel red list. Passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from 4am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for 10 days.In the case of the United States, most non-US citizens who have been in the eight affected countries within the prior 14 days will not be allowed enter. Many bans announced around the world kick in immediately, unlike those issued by Mr Biden.The United States only lifted the travel curbs on 33 countries including South Africa, China, much of Europe, India, Brazil, Ireland, Britain and Iran on November 8th, after blocking the entry of most foreign nationals who had recently been in those countries since beginning in early 2020. A White House official told Reuters the decision to implement the rules from Monday was due to procedures that had to be done before such a ban could be put in place, including working with transportation authorities and airlines.AmsterdamDutch health authorities have said 61 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid-19, and tests for the Omicron variant among the people infected were being conducted.About 600 passengers arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing due to concerns over the new virus variant.The Dutch government banned all air travel from southern Africa early on Friday. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge determined that passengers already en route to the Netherlands would have to undergo testing and quarantine upon arrival.Meanwhile, a number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”.Novavax said it has “already initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B.1.1.529 and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks”.Moderna said: “Since early 2021, Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new variants of concern.“This strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized 50µg booster dose of mRNA-1273 prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron variant.”Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the event of a variant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects “to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that variant in approximately 100 days, subject to regulatory approval”.AstraZeneca said it has “developed, in close collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine platform that enables us to respond quickly to new variants that may emerge” and is “already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified”.The firm is also testing its antibody combination drug against the new variant and is “hopeful” it “will retain efficacy since it comprises two potent antibodies with different and complementary activities against the virus”. – ReutersPAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"easy cynical quietly making success brexit","story":"Sir Robert Peel once remarked that public opinion is a compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs. I’m not so cynical, but any of us who followed the Brexit debate over the last few years could certainly see his views reflected in some of the downbeat corners of the media. All too often, the negative angle taken about our leaving the European Union can feel pessimistic, particularly for those of us who see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to regain our nation’s sovereignty. Our successes are often denied the space they deserve, while challenges — real or imagined — are seized upon and blown up into headlines. For the first time in fifty years, the United Kingdom is an independent trading nation with a government answerable only to the British people. Any big change brings challenges, yes, but to focus solely on them is not only wrong, but means that our tangible successes don’t get a look-in.One area that often flies under the radar is the work we’re doing to open up markets all around the world, beyond trade deals.As we said when launching our Export Strategy last week, research shows firms that export are more productive, more profitable and pay higher wages on average than those that don’t. And there is, understandably, huge appetite for high-quality British goods and services worldwide, making it mutually beneficial. That’s why the Department for International Trade is working flat out to give British businesses the opportunity to sell their brilliant goods and services around the planet more easily than ever before — positioning us to take advantage of the markets of tomorrow and unleashing the UK\u0027s full potential.  That means cutting through unnecessary red tape and working with our trading partners across the world to set the conditions in which British businesses can thrive. This can be tricky, and it can take some time. But, for the country, it’s worth it.   Last year, we opened up access for major names like Diageo and Waitrose, as well as iconic Jersey dairy products and Scotch whisky. We clarified labelling requirements to achieve greater access to Jordan’s £2.5 billion food import market, and worked with Indian counterparts to increase permitted investment in their insurance market by a whopping 25 per cent, supporting British firms to grow their share of a market worth over £4 billion.  In Colombia, we worked with authorities to support development of ambitious environmental regulations that will support green investments from British firms. In Japan, we helped ensure British sausages could be marketed and sold appropriately.   The list goes on. I’m proud to say that figures published yesterday show we successfully resolved a total of 217 trade barriers across 74 countries – up 20 per cent on last year’s total. So much for the doubters, doomsters and gloomsters.  We must never forget just how much the UK has to offer as the world’s second largest services exporter and fifth largest economy. We have agreed trade deals with 70 countries — plus the EU — worth £766 billion. No other nation has secured so many trade deals with so many of its counterparts in such a short space of time. And this is just the beginning. We are making headway in dynamic economies around the world, and we have shaken hands on agreements with our good friends in Australia and New Zealand.   This paves the way for our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (sometimes called CPTPP), a truly enormous free trade area with a combined GDP well in excess of £8 trillion last year. This Indo-Pacific tilt will hitch us to a fast-growing, dynamic region that we could do so much more with. We’re making great progress in our ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. And we are preparing to begin trade negotiations with India, which is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2050.  The opportunities available to a newly independent United Kingdom are all but limitless. In charge of our own destiny, we will bulldoze more and more trade barriers, and sign even more deals in the years and decades to come, giving our brilliant British businesses the freedom to look beyond the horizon and seize the opportunities out there.Ranil Jayawardena MP is Minister for International TradeMore from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Over 60 test positive after flying from South Africa to Amsterdam as fears rise over Omicron variantFirst two UK cases of new omicron variant confirmed in Essex and NottinghamshireStorm Arwen: Two killed by falling trees as winds of almost 100mph batter UKWatch: The truth about the Royals\u0026#39 \u0026#39deal\u0026#39 with the press‘People just won’t be able to live’: Tory supporters voice concerns before bellwether by-electionRow over new German government\u0026#39s plans to reform abortion lawMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"judges people smugglers united disregarding importance borders","story":"Central to a democratic nation is the idea that citizenship brings rights. It follows that if non-citizens can arrive illegally and then avail themselves of those rights, the interests of citizens are damaged. Democracy is thus damaged too. This – not racism – is the main reason why most voters hate illegal immigration.The influx of people by boat on to the south coast of England makes this illegality visible. Illegal immigration by other means has, in fact, fallen sharply, as has net migration. This is mainly because of Covid, partly because of Brexit, but also because, contrary to widespread belief, there has been effective co-operation between French and British about tunnel crossings. Until about two years ago, a farming neighbour tells me, it was commonplace for fruit lorries from the Continent to arrive at a Kent packhouse, open their doors and disgorge several stowaways who then ran away. No longer.Instead, the rickety boats come, in growing numbers. This week, as was eventually inevitable given the crowding and the heartlessness of the smugglers, one such boat sank, drowning almost all on board.We live about a dozen miles from the coast where such boats land. Friends who live closer sometimes watch the arrivals at Winchelsea Beach, Dungeness or Hastings, landings that are often assisted by the RNLI. They bear no ill will to the people seeking the opportunities that Britain offers. But they do feel oppressed by the sense of helplessness. One, a doctor, points out that if a comparable boat capsized in nearby waters, “30 severely hypothermic or half-drowned human beings appearing at once would overwhelm the hospital in a way that no wave of Covid has managed to do”. There is little preparation. An air of fatalism hangs over the whole subject of the boats, as if nothing can be done.The easiest, most enjoyable thing just now is to blame the French. Far be it from me to defend Emmanuel Macron. He is undoubtedly seeking electoral advantage in next year’s presidential election. But if you imagine the situations reversed, with us in Britain being lectured by France that we must not let illegal immigrants leave our shores for theirs, I think you can see how the French might feel.In the short term, with a lack of trust between Macron and Boris Johnson, made worse by No10’s strange decision to publish in advance the Prime Minister’s letter to the president about joint policing, the prospects of a joint approach are poor.Nevertheless, the true interests of both countries are closely aligned. Britain does not want the boats, of course, but nor does France. It is terrible for President Macron that this week’s drowning happened on his watch. It is also extremely unpleasant for the residents of northern France that Calais is a sort of fortress and that people smugglers infest their territory. Immigration is a considerably fiercer issue in French politics than in ours, highly damaging to Macron.If France agreed to let us turn the boats back – an agreement that would, admittedly, cost us a great deal of money – it would not be long before the business model of the smugglers collapsed and with it, their frightening sway. An unstated reason why French police sometimes just stand and watch as the boats load up on remote beaches is that they are heavily outnumbered and literally outgunned by the smugglers. Kill the trade, and all that goes.More widely, this is a European issue – and by “European”, I do not mean EU alone. We in Britain groan under the weight of asylum applications: one good aspect of the forthcoming, rather limited Nationality and Borders Bill is that it will pare down our absurdly extensive rights of asylum appeal. But both Germany and France have far bigger numbers of asylum seekers than we do and face a greater existential risk from trans-continental migration.The recent migrations into Poland laid on by Belarus (with Russian backing) are not far short of undeclared war. Non-European migrants have been press-ganged, sometimes even flown in, to attempt mass incursions there. Western Europeans well understand that this is a hostile political act, not a spontaneous movement of refugees, and are co-operating to resist it. Britain, for instance, is contributing engineers to Poland to help reinforce physical borders.In the Channel, there is no comparable plot by a nation or nations to invade us with a conscript army of the wretched of the earth, but there is a situation that is politically dangerous to Western democracy. Borders define rights, responsibilities and jurisdictions. If those borders are not upheld, those rights and responsibilities are undermined, and jurisdictions become blurred. This gives advantage to bad actors, such as people smugglers and Islamist terrorists.This blurring of jurisdictions began in the 1970s and became much more apparent in our Continent, first after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and later with mass movements from disturbed parts of the Muslim world and Africa. The people most responsible for this have been judges, and the “human rights” lawyers for whom this has become a big industry.In an interesting study – titled Immigration, Strasbourg and Judicial Overreach – published by the think tank Policy Exchange earlier this year, Professor John Finnis, the distinguished legal philosopher, and Simon Murray, a barrister practising in the immigration field, explained what has gone wrong with “human rights”.To avoid renewing the horrors of the Second World War, the victors, with Britain playing the leading role, drew up the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1950. With similar aims, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was signed the following year.Finnis and Murray argue that the original documents understood their limits. Their authors sensed danger if rights were too absolute for sovereign states to handle. Thus they contained no obligation to let in refugees if they arrived at borders en masse, no legal (as opposed to moral) obligation to accept refugees at all and no absolute obligation to provide refuge to asylum seekers who were a danger to the community.Many years later, however, judges began to develop the doctrine that the ECHR is a “living instrument” – a lawyer’s way of saying that judges are free to make it mean whatever they think the spirit of the age demands. They used this latitude to expand enormously all the definitions – what is meant, for example, by the right to privacy and family life in Article 8.Gradually, their judgments incentivised illegal immigration because they meant that, once you got into the country of your choice, no one could get you out. In Britain, Tony Blair gold-plated the “living instrument”, turning the ECHR into our Human Rights Act.So there is co-operation, in effect – though not, of course, in intention – between the judges and the people smugglers. The former give illegal immigrants a get-out-of-jail-free card, and the latter, for large sums of money, get them where they want to be.As Finnis and Murray put it, this liberal interpretation of rights “incoherently privileges preventing risks to non-citizens over risks to citizens”.That, unfortunately, is where we are. It is pretty much where we shall remain unless we in Britain – and preferably the entire free world – decide the law should respect the borders and wishes of democracies instead of disregarding them.The task of reining back judicial overreach is similar to the “taking back control” sought by Brexit. So far, our leaders have lacked the stomach for it.More from NewsHow to show proof of Covid vaccination status for travel abroadCoronavirus latest news: Over 60 test positive after flying from South Africa to Amsterdam as fears rise over Omicron variantFirst two UK cases of new omicron variant confirmed in Essex and NottinghamshireStorm Arwen: Two killed by falling trees as winds of almost 100mph batter UKWatch: The truth about the Royals\u0026#39 \u0026#39deal\u0026#39 with the press‘People just won’t be able to live’: Tory supporters voice concerns before bellwether by-electionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need take back lives permanent covid panic mongers","story":"So we’re back here again. We’re heading into Christmas. Families are planning to gather. The worst appears to be behind us.Then a new Covid variant emerges. Government rhetoric shifts. The variant is “of huge concern”, ministers declare, and “we must act with caution”. There’s an immediate travel ban, once again turning thousands of families’ lives upside-down to no obvious purpose. Labour calls ardently for “mask-wearing in public places”. Senior scientists start telling people to get ready to go backwards, away from normality.But there’s a difference this time: we are not sitting ducks. This country has just implemented an unprecedented mass vaccination programme. The vast majority of people have some sort of immunity, and most of the vulnerable have recently had a booster shot.Yet, somehow, we are still in “do something!” mode. At the first sign of trouble, the calls for lockdowns, restrictions and vaccine passports rise to a clamour. Journalists fill press conferences with endless rounds of questions about why we aren’t “doing more”. The question of when exactly we plan to return to a normal level of risk appetite goes unasked, let alone answered.The forever-lockdown crowd have some points on their side, as they always do. We don’t know much about the latest variant. It has a lot more mutations than prior ones, they say, and might be even more transmissible. We don’t know if it’s deadlier or milder. We don’t know whether it will escape our vaccines more easily or not. It could all be a disaster, the end of the world, the wave to end all waves. Or not.There are some things we do know, however. We know that new variants are now a permanent fact of life. We know that they will find their way here with or without these pointless “travel bans”. We know that fast-spreading variants will soon, like others before them, become endemic. We know that we have seven vaccines and counting in our arsenal.We also have strong evidence that this country is now highly resistant to Covid. More than 80 per cent of Britons over 12 have had two vaccine doses, 28 per cent have had three and up to 14 per cent are thought to have caught the virus since July.The recent wave, which was really more of a ripple, failed to raise death rates or hospitalisations to anything like the levels seen at the peak last January. Then it began to subside, even before the booster programme had reached all of the vulnerable. Professor Lockdown himself, Neil Ferguson, thinks we might be “almost at herd immunity”.Meanwhile, we have limited evidence that measures other than vaccines actually achieve very much. Scotland still requires widespread mask-wearing, yet its case rate rose higher than England’s this autumn. October cases peaked more than a week before school half terms, suggesting school breaks weren’t the reason for the ebb.Total lockdowns, of the kind seen in March last year, do seem to work, but they also destroy society. And the Sweden debate rumbles on: the country that never locked down and experienced death rates far higher than its Nordic neighbours, but far lower than ours.Yet even before Thursday’s news about the latest variant, the bureaucratic, lazy and risk-averse were threatening everyone with their procedures and precautions. While most of life has managed to return to some semblance of normality, state-run institutions have been struggling to emerge from the Covid bubble.Every new headline is an excuse for unions to moan that working isn’t “safe”. Thousands of public sector workers are still sitting at home, depressing productivity, soaking up buckets of fresh public spending and choking the economy (just think of the DVLA lorry licence backlog). All sorts of places, like public museums, still try to demand mask-wearing, even though the law doesn’t. The administrative burden and expense attached to flying abroad have multiplied with no end in sight.Schools are among the most prolific spreaders of Covid safety-ism, when they should be the ones fighting hardest against it for the sake of their students. Bans on shaking hands, masking, cancelled nativity plays, draconian sickness policies: everything must still operate in the shadow of the virus.Worst of all, as The  reported this week, some schools have even taken it upon themselves to impose “circuit breaks” – week-long “online learning” snooze-fests in which the teachers sit around at home while their pupils fall further and further behind. Such closures should be illegal.Instead, with news of this variant, these sorts of measures are going to spread. Just when it looked like the Government was being proven right about giving us back our freedoms and resisting Europe’s fresh lockdown fever, the proponents of never-ending Covid panic have regained the initiative. They want to show that liberty can still be suspended at a moment’s notice and society can still be put in the freezer.It’s already clear that certain aspects of life will never return to normal. We’ll be carrying crumpled up masks in our pockets for years. Travellers will forever be forced to file dissertations of unnecessary paperwork in order to fly anywhere and in many countries will have to show proof of vaccination. Sticking a swab up your nose every so often will simply be a part of life from now on. These things are dismal, but inevitable.What we cannot accept, however, is that our basic freedoms are now just loans that can be called in at any time. Free societies do not require their citizens to get new vaccines every year in order to live a normal life. They do not allow teachers to shut down schools at the drop of a hat. They do not suspend Christmas or close offices or ban drinking every time something unusual pops up in a laboratory somewhere.Last year, as the country entered its third and most depressing lockdown over Christmas, politicians supporting the restrictions promised us that liberation was just around the corner. “Let’s not fall at the last hurdle,” they said. “The vaccine is here!” they said. “Just wait for the rollout and then enjoy your freedoms.”Well, the rollout has happened. The virus is still out there, evolving, and it’s going to keep evolving forever. This is as good as it’s going to get. So we need to know when and how we will switch from “Covid mode” back to “normal life”. With so many panic-mongers resisting the change, it won’t happen without a fight. We need to know the Government actually wants to win it.Have we lost the plot? Interpol, the international policing agency, has just elected a new Chinese official to its executive committee after the last guy, an official named Meng Hongwei, was literally disappeared by the Chinese state. There is no symbol that better represents the state of the world’s governance organisations.Interpol helps its 195 member countries to share policing information and issues cross-border arrest warrants for iniduals they want to nab. One of its four founding principles is “respect for human rights”. But authoritarian regimes have found that it’s an excellent vehicle for hunting down dissident and ethnic minority targets who have slipped through their fingers.In recent years, China has stepped up its use of Interpol to pursue democracy activists, government critics and prominent members of groups it wants to exterminate. Xi Jinping has launched two campaigns, called “Fox Hunt” and “Sky Net”, whose aims are to sweep up and extradite critics of his regime abroad. Research by the human rights group Safeguard Defenders shows that Chinese state media have boasted that Interpol tools are being used in nearly 3,000 cases as part of these campaigns.The farcical case of Meng and his replacement shows how easy we make it for Beijing. In 2018, Meng, the chief of Interpol, took a trip back to China – and never returned. Yet here we are three years later and Beijing has a new official on Interpol’s executive committee. Have you disappeared your own official? Never mind! Send another one!Democratic countries provide more than 60 per cent of the funding for Interpol, yet as usual we have rendered ourselves procedurally impotent, having diffused voting power among the organisation’s many member states.Still, there are levers we could pull. Dozens of parliamentarians in the International Parliamentary Alliance on China wrote a letter in opposition to China’s plans to get its official on to Interpol’s committee. Where was the campaign at government level? And what are Interpol’s biggest funders doing to ensure that its practices follow its legal commitment to political neutrality and human rights? Interpol recently introduced a code of conduct and began reforms that it says will “ensure greater transparency”. Its critics are sceptical.Recently, Meng’s wife, Grace, who lives in France with their children, spoke publicly for the first time about how she fears the long arm of Beijing. This power is being amplified by bodies like Interpol. And through them, democracies, rather than hindering this activity, are aiding and abetting it.The world recently had a taste of how the Chinese “disappearing” system works. Peng Shuai is not a typical government critic. She is a tennis player with a network and fan base across the globe. Still, when she spoke out about being sexually abused by a senior retired Communist Party official called Zhang Gaoli, she was quickly and effectively silenced.First, the regime deleted her blog post. Then she disappeared from view for days. Then she reappeared smiling, attending official events, going to dinner with “friends” (including several unsmiling, official-looking men) and even held a half-hour phone -call with Olympic bureaucrats, who afterwards declared her to be “fine”.Had Peng known about the hell raised abroad by her friends and foreign governments, she might have concluded that her best chance of escaping China and the lifetime of surveillance, gagging and control now awaiting her would be to stick to her guns. But she was presumably kept in the dark. Pressure must have been applied to secure her co-operation. The usual method would be to take family members hostage.

People ing to the UK from those countries will have to quarantine. Mr Brown said health leaders had given the Government repeated warnings that new iants could develop due to a lack of vaccines for poorer countries. Writing for the , Mr Brown said: In the absence of mass vaccination, Covid is not only spreading uninhibited among unprotected people but is mutating, with new iants emerging out of the poorest countries and now threatening to unleash themselves on even fully vaccinated people in the richest countries in the world.  Fewer than % of people in Africa have been fully immunised against Covid- and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose. Those conditions can speed up the spread of the virus, offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous iant. Mr Brown wrote: The figure exceeds % in both high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries. Every day, for every vaccine delivered as first vaccine in the poorest countries, six times as many doses are being administered as third and booster vaccines in the richest parts of the world.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr Brown said the UKaposs failure to deliver  million vaccines, of which it has so far donated %, is probably the biggest international public policy failure of our times.  He added the decision will come back to haunt our own country, and said: The problem is there are enough vaccines to go around. We will have  billion vaccines by the end of the year which is enough to vaccinate the whole world. They are being unequally distributed. We have set aside vaccines for boosters and young people and there are still spare vaccines for other countries. We are depriving people the chance to survive the virus by denying the chance in so many countries to get the vaccines. His thoughts were echoed by Dr Osman Dar, project director at One Health Project, who said: The emergence of a new Covid- iant with all its myriad mutations is not unexpected. What it highlights are the continuing and fundamental risks to everyone associated with not seriously addressing the inequalities still at play globally in the fight against disease and poor health. He added that the travel ban has economically penalised, socially ostracised and socio-politically stigmatised the countries on the red list even though they did the right thing through their timely reporting and sharing of the iantaposs genetic data. Dr Dar added: Whataposs necessary, to limit the negative socio-economic impacts of these restrictive measures on trade and travel, is to have a sufficiently resourced global regime in place. This should support countries reporting new iants through the signicant financial and social hardships that then ensue - a disaster or pandemic fund specically engineered around the impacts of trade and travel restrictions.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is “huge international concern” surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.With Moderna “rapidly advancing” a booster jab to combat Omicron, Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UK’s Covid treatments, Ronapreve.  Ministers were facing calls to impose tougher restrictions to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case. Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a “very, very, very dficult situation”.Ministers were considering adding two more countries to the travel aposred listapos on Friday night, the Daily Mail reported.A government adviser suggested Brits should be ready for the possibility of ato Covid restrictions. However, a senior government source told the newspaper that people should not panic.  In the Netherlands, health officials said dozens of people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday are likely infected with Covid-. They were conducting further testing to seepeople are infected with the recently discovered Omicron iant. Dutch officials estimated that  of about  passengers had Covid. Omicron was first discovered in South Africa and has been designated a “iant of concern” by the World Health Organisation . Senior UK scientists had previously described it as the aposworst everapos Covid iant detected so far. The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant, which the organisation named Omicron, has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains. The EU, US and Canada all followed Britain’s move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants. Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”. No cases have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium – after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel – has heightened concerns. Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later. The six African countries were added to the UK’s travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days. Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested. Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government “won’t hesitate to actwe need to do so”. Mr Johnson held a call with South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon after foreign minister Naledi Pandor said the flight ban “seems to have been rushed”. The Prime Minister “commended South Africa’s rapid genomic sequencing” and its “leadership in transparently sharing scientic data”, Downing Street said. “They discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid- iant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel,” a statement said. Prof Edmunds said the new strain “is a huge worry” and that “all the data suggests” it would be able to evade current immunity.“Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,” he told BBC Radio ’s PM programme.Prof Edmunds urged ministers to look at extending travel restrictions and to prepare a plan to deal with Omicron because “at some point we’re going to get this iant here in the UK”.  He suggested mass testing and local restrictions must be looked at while other preparations could include making the booster programme more rapid, perhaps by reducing the gap between second and third doses, and widening it to younger age groups. “Even the vaccines don’t work particularly well against this new iant, they do against Delta, and we’re still fighting a Delta wave and we certainly don’t want to be fighting both at the same time,” he said. “There are things we can do and we need to get on with it very rapidly.” The Government said as of am on Friday, there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK, the highest reported daily figure since October . It also said a further  people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Friday, bringing the UK total to ,. South African scientists fear the iant is behind a dramatic rise in cases in some regions, including Gauteng province, which includes the cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg. Pfizer BioNTech, which has produced a vaccine against Covid-, is already studying the new iant’s ability to evade vaccines. Experts have said vaccines can be tweaked to tackle new iants as they emerge.

Hannah Pawley was fired from Hanleyaposs Restaurant, Drfield, Yorkshire, after taking time off to recover.The restaurant, run by head chef Sean Hanley, refused to pay her the statutory sick leave which she was legally entitled to whilst she was off work following the ectopic pregnancy. A tribunal ruled in her favour and she has won £, following a two-year legal battle.The woman was awarded the sum for her sick pay and potential lost earnings.  Leeds Employment Tribunal also found that the employer falsied records to hide the fact that she wasnapost being remunerated, which left Hannah unable to claim benefits. Hannah, who has since had a baby and started a homemade food delivery service, said: I felt used and betrayed by my employer Sean Hanley. I asked for my monies owed and a valid reason for firing me. As he couldnapost provide one, I felt I had no other option but to bring my case forward to ACAS [the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service] and fight. Even at my most broken and vulnerable point, I felt I had to fight for this gross wrongdoing.  Hannah had been working for Hanleyaposs Restaurant for five months and as a chef for four years in the lead up to her dismissal. But in November , she suffered an ectopic pregnancy and had to take sick leave as she was unwell and had to cope with strong medical treatment. Hannahaposs leave was certied as pregnancy-related sickness. According to the law, she was entitled to take as much leave as necessary without any detriment to her employment. In addition, her employer had been informed that she had experienced an ectopic pregnancy and needed time to physically recover. Speaking after the ruling, Hannah said it was a relief to finally get justice. She added: The relief to know that it has been officially recognised and noted that I was treated poorly is hugely healing. I hope this is not only a warning to employers but a big plus to any women who feel they have been wronged. If it feels wrong - it probably is.

Taryn Robinson, from charity Pregnant Then Screwed, who advised Hannah following her sacking, said it was time to end penalties incurred by women following motherhood. She said: At Pregnant Then Screwed we hear of women being forced out of their jobs following a miscarriage time and time again. Sadly, these women rarely use the law to access the justice they deserve as they simply donapost have the emotional energy. Employers need to do so much better to ensure their workplaces are fair and safe environments for everyone. There is a national conversation taking place about the importance of progressive reproductive health-related policies Cases like Hannahaposs show the negative impact that a lack of support and protection can have on women and their careers.

Google was bringing up results about whether heaposd eaten a nut, or whether heaposd eaten a poisonous leaf. I thought aposheaposs probably eaten something poisonous, because the worldaposs so dangerousapos. He just hammed it up. I swear Cocker Spaniels are known for this. He was just looking at me with sad eyes, so I was really worried. I was genuinely panicking. He was so young, I didnapost understand what could be wrong.

Marianne Fraser and fiance William brought the puppy, Thor, from a breeder on October  but they claim he started to act aggressively after a week. He began to regularly attack Marianne by locking onto her legs and biting and in the end the couple were forced to give up the dog, it is alleged. Images show Marianneaposs legs with severe bruising and, she says, bite marks from the German shepherd-Belgian Malinois cross who allegedly had serious behavioural issues.  Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror The couple said the dog had come from Fawnnest Kennels in Lockerbie, Scotland, and William told the MailOnline how they saw a dramatic change in its behaviour after a week. He started to challenge Marianne, locking on and not letting go, then the biting started. After couple of days, he got worse and it resulted in Marianne endlessly being attacked and her face being hurt, William said. Thor was picked up by Julie Nevett who runs a rescue centre which specialises in retraining pups for military or police purposes.She wrote on Facebook how she had received another dog from the same litter, which she named Thor , due to similar behavioural problems and was critical of the breeder.  I feel dreadful for both owners, not only have they lost a signicant amount of money and their puppy, they have quite serious injuries. I b****y hope the breeders are suitably ashamed of themselves. In an update, she insisted that the dogs are not pet pups but rather working line pups whose nature needs to be channelled appropriately and she rubbished the idea that either dog needs to be put down.  Replying to her first post, one person claimed that a friend had bought a German Shepherd from the same breeder which turned out to be riddled with problems. William has since said heaposs contacted the SPCA and his local council over the kennels who he claims have offered to refund the money in exchange for having the puppy back. He added: Itaposs not about the money - itaposs about the pup and what they have done.This is not Thor the pupaposs fault as they have obviously been kept as wild animals.

Bryony Cude, , and a group of friends bought three chicken kormas as part of a £ order from Ali Raj Indian restaurant. The teen says they waited  minutes and claimed the meal arrived noticeably undercooked.When they rang the restaurant to ask for a refund, their request was refused, DevonLive reports. Owner and chef Shafique Uddin insist the chicken was not raw and that it was discoloured. He even accused the girls of playing a practical joke and smoking or drinking when they insisted on having their money back.  Bryonyaposs father Simon Cude, from Cullompton, said: My daughter and a few of her friends got together for one of the girlaposs birthdays and instead of going out like normal teenagers they decided to have a girls night with a takeaway. They ordered the food they wanted and paid for this out of their own money - which they have earnt doing work for dferent places. They waited for over an hour for the food to arrive which they understood with takeaway’s being busy on a Saturday night. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.When the food arrived it was stone cold so the girls were fine with that and reheated it in a microwave, only to discover that the food wasn’t cooked properly and the chicken was raw. Simon said the group then called the restaurant and after a -minute conversation a driver came back to pick up the chicken and bring it back to the restaurant for inspection. The girls later received a phone call to tell them the chicken was not raw. He said: They called Ali Raj Takeaway and explained the food wasn’t cooked and askedthey could have either a replacement for the food or a refund - this was refused point-blank saying the girls had probably been smoking or been drinking. He then demanded to pick up the uncooked chicken by one of his drivers, which he did and then told the girls there was nothing wrong with it and they will not be getting any refund or replacement food. As you can imagine a small party of girls who choose to have a night in instead of being out and about with other friends was ruined. I think the way that he handled the situation and the way he had spoken to the girls was just as bad as the food. Ali Raj Indian Restaurant has since been contacted to respond to the claims and confirm that the curry in the images is theirs.  Owner and Chef Shafique Uddin, said: We served over  chicken kormas,the chicken was going to be raw I should have got inundated with complaints because we pre-cook the chicken and we serve it in the evening. I said Iaposll send a driver over and he can pick up the dish and we can check it ourselves, so we sent the driver over and he picked up the chicken and I looked at it, they actually put it in pieces - ripped the chicken all up. I saw the chicken but it wasnapost raw, you know sometimes when you get coloured bits, it is not all going to be white, thereaposs going to be a dark patch. Whenever you cook that chicken the dark patch gets even darker but they assumed it was raw and I kept telling them it is not raw - my driver ate the chicken. I said I can give you a chicken korma next time and she said aposoh no we want our full refundapos and I said I canapost do that because the chickenaposs not raw in the first place. That piece is brown - not all chicken breasts are going to be white. When askedhe asked Bryonyshe had been drinking or smoking he said: Yeah I did say that because our conversation went on for over  minutes. I thought they must have been a little bit drunk or something because theyaposre not listening to me. I said is this a prank call she said aposnoapos and I said well it sounds like it because all you want is a full refund. I said the chicken isnapost raw so I canapost give you a full refund - Iaposve got nothing to hide.

Jodie Weston - who supported Idris Elba at a gig last weekend - also said some drivers have even texted her afterwards because theyaposve saved her number.The -year-old told The Daily Star that she has become numb” to men sexually harassing her when she’s working in nightclubs.The Rich Kids Go Skint personality said: “It’s not right but it is the le of a woman. It is hard to be a woman and it’s not OK. “It’s really bad and it’s bad that you become numb to it because it happens so often. I do think the world is changing but it’s not quite there yet. “I’ve had taxi drivers ask methey can come back to mine with me. They also try to text me afterwards because they have my number from the booking.” Jodie - who also played at London’s Ministry of Sound last month - said she often brings male friends to avoid harassment. She explained: “I get a lot of inappropriate comments for how I dress. I’m not wearing turtle necks, I like being a woman and I like being sexy. “I enjoy embracing my figure. I like to DJ wearing glamorous clothes but I get a lot of hate from that. “I often take a male friend with me DJing just so people think it’s a boyfriend even though it’s just a friend. “I usually have at least one male friend with me to make sure nothing untoward happens.” Jodie also told about how she was groped and bitten in a frightening attack two years ago in East London as she was on her way to one of her gigs. Jodie, who hosts a radio show called The Dollhouse Show on Flex FM, says she is still targeted by trolls despite her success. She said: “I have had so many trolls saying I must dress down to cover a lack of talent.“Usually they are people who have never been to a gig. They look at my Instagram and make assumptions about me, it’s mainly men but I do get it from girls too which is annoying.”She admits that the cruel comments do upset her but they have also driven her to be successful. She added: “I’ve always had a fighter mindset and I even had family members tell me I wouldn’t make it as a DJ but it gives me fuel to prove people wrong.  Being a reality show star won’t help you when you’re playing at high-end venues like Ministry of Sound, it will make you have to prove yourself ten times moreanything. “I’ve had to prove I have the talent. When I was doing reality shows and first starting DJing I got trolls coming at me every single day.

Katie told OK! : Eugenie and Jack are very close to Harry and Meghan.Itaposs actually one of the few close relationships Harry and Meghan have retained in the royal family. It appears that the bond between Harry and Eugenie has been a long-shared one that goes way back to when they were children.Both their mothers, the late Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, were close friends, who spent a lot of time together. They even went on holiday together with the children also tagging along, forming the basis of the bond.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. As they grew older, the royal cousins hit the London club scene together and they were regulars at the popular London club, Mahiki, sneaking in the back entrance. Insiders say that of all of the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie had the most natural connections and are the closest of friends. In their book Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim Harry and Eugenieaposs roles within the royal family was the base of their close relationship.  They write: Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Not being in a senior role meant that she had to go out into the world and find her own path, which she has done, moving to New York in  to work at Paddle, the auction house run by Mishaaposs husband and Harryaposs friend Alexander. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.  And due to this bond, Eugenie was one of the first people Harry told about Meghan, and he was keen to introduce them. Eugenie reportedly told a friend Meghan was just the tonic for her cousin.More recently, since Harryaposs move away from the UK to Calornia, he and Meghan allowed Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank to live in Frogmore Cottage at Windsor.In fact, when Harry travelled back to the UK for Prince Philipaposs funeral and for the unveiling of the Princess Diana statue, he is said to have isolated at Frogmore Cottage with Eugenie and Jack, who have a young son named August, due to Covid-related travel restrictions. Recently, Eugenie spoke out about her cousin, saying she wouldn’t presume to give advice to Harry and Meghan, except to say to be happy.And when Harry and Meghan announced the birth of their daughter Lilibet in June, Eugenie took to Instagram to congratulate her dear cousins.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal FamilyPrincess Eugenie\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Footage from one of the hotels which currently houses dozens of asylum seekers shows insects crawling in the base of the shower. Another video, taken at a dferent hotel its residents have asked the Mirror not to identy for fear of reprisals from the owners, captures maggots slithering across the floor. A third piece of footage shows mice running around a bedroom, while water can be seen gushing through the ceiling of a home where a family of asylum seekers were living. The ceiling of that home later collapsed. Photos from one hotel show two children, who spent a period of time in the Calais Jungle, covered in what appear to be bed bug bites. The images, which were all taken in West London, were shared with the Mirror to highlight the conditions many people who seek asylum in this country are living under as they wait, sometimes years, for their refugee status to be approved or rejected. Living on a small allowance of several pounds a day, and with no right to work until their applications are approved, often theyaposre unable to buy basic sanitary products to clean their rooms. The fear of being thrown out of the country by the Home Office means most people do not raise issues regarding their accommodation, an insider told the Mirror. This can lead to property health hazards and infestations going unreported and untreated. Access to hotels where theyaposre staying is highly restricted, meaning conditions inside remain largely a mystery. Volunteers have to meet residents in the car parks outside to deliver clothes donated by kind Brits. Less charitable people drive to the hotels to dump bags of rubbish in a kind of dirty protest against the asylum seekersapos efforts to make lives for themselves in the country. An immigration insider said: The people living in dispersed accommodation, they are put anywhere in the country and moved with a momentaposs notice. They canapost object. Very often they donapost get told until theyaposre in the transport where theyaposre going. It is called dispersal accommodation. If theyaposre in a hotel theyaposre on £ a week. Theyaposre frightened to speak out when there are issues, and frightened of not seeming grateful, so the issues will come to light after several months when they finally burst into tears when talking to a volunteer. In the case of the shower with the jumping termites, the lad never used it. He was too repulsed by it to wash. Many, many of the rooms have proper bed bug infestations. Itaposs a really big problem. If they didnapost feel in danger where they come from they wouldnapost live like this. They are not being looked after that helps them be a benefit to society. There is a lot of wasted talent among these families. The videos were shared with the Mirror at the end of a tragic week in which  people died trying to get to the UK. They lost their lives when their dinghy capsized while trying to cross the English Channel from France. Five women and a girl are reportedly among the victims confirmed dead so far in what has been described as the deadliest incident of its kind ever. People currently in Calais but hoping to get to the UK told The Mirror how they still planned on making the perilous journey, despite the freezing, rough waters in front of them. They said people smugglers’ prices of at least £, per head for a -metre boat with around  to  people squeezed in, meant the gang involved in the tragedy had taken at least £, in cash from those who died in the sea. Other estimates put the figure as high as £, per person. Jon, a -year-old former electrical engineering student from Eritrea, told how he and  other asylum seekers cheated death in the ocean on the same day  others perished.He set out on a small boat and paid £ for his share, only for the craft to sink into the icy water. Once, and , they make the crossing, many people are taking in by the authorities and processed. This is the beginning of a very y process which often sees people thrown out of the country. While they wait for their application to be heard, many are moved across the country to live away from those they travelled with, often alongside people without a language in common. Although the most recent yearaposs statistics have not yet been compiled, data from  shows that the UK receives far fewer first time asylum applications than other European countries its size.In  , applications were made, compared to three times that in Germany, and more than double that in France and Spain. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We expect high standards from our accommodation providers, and where we are alerted to substandard accommodation we will act.However, the Mirror have refused to provide us with the name of this accommodation which would allow us to look into these claims. “We use licenced hotels which are permitted for use by the local authority. If any asylum seeker has a problem with their accommodation they can contact Migrant Help, which is available  days a year and  hours a day. “The Nationality and Borders Bill will deliver the most comprehensive reform in decades to fix the broken asylum system.It will make the system fairer and more effective so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Home OfficeAsylum Seekers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nichola Petermann was just  when she learned she had Hodgkin lymphoma and needed immediate treatment - forcing her to leave her dream job months after she started.Medics believed her symptoms, which included fevers, abdominal pain and night sweats, were a result of her contracting coronavirus in January.But as her illness got progressively worse she found herself taking painkillers six times a day in order to continue her day-to-day le. In the absence of answers Nichola, from Glasgow, repeatedly sought medical attention, but the likelihood of it being long Covid masked the advanced stage her cancer had reached. It was only after a visit to her grandmaaposs home that Nichola realised just how ill she actually was - because she needed more sleep and ate even less than her elderly relative. Charity bosses say they fear Nicholaaposs cancer experience could be replicated across the UK, as signs of cancer can be very similar to the long-term effects of coronavirus. When she was finally diagnosed with stage b cancer, her condition was so advanced that she was advised to start chemotherapy the following day - forcing her to leave her dream job working in TV which sheaposd started in December. Nichola told The Mirror: I did think it was long Covid for a long time, I had no idea how serious it was. Because I was working and it was harder to see GPs, it was really hard. I treated it myself with pain relief, but eventually it got to the point where I couldnapost handle it anymore. I was taking paracetamol six times a day, I donapost think they believed me when I said how much pain I was in. It was only when she visited her grandmother, who is herself battling stomach cancer, that she realised how ill she was. I noticed that I was sleeping more and eating less than she was, she said. That’s when I knew for certain that something was wrong. When the pain in Nicholaaposs abdomen and lower back became too much to bear, she contacted NHS , which referred her to an Immediate Assessment Unit because staff were worried about the amount of paracetamol she was taking.However, when ultrasounds and X-rays did not reveal a gynaecological problem Nichola was on the verge of being discharged before a final set of tests finally revealed how ill she was. I was told I was possibly going home, even though I was clearly in a lot of pain, she said. I was scared about having to leave. It was only after an ultrasound revealed oian cysts and trapped fluid that medics were finally able to give her a le-saving cancer diagnosis. By that stage her lymph nodes were swollen - another symptom she put down to long Covid - and doctors had to break the news that Nichola had Hodgkin lymphoma. I hadnapost heard of it, I didnapost know what it meant, she said. Itaposs a very aggressive cancer, but that does mean it can be easier to treat. As soon as it was diagnosed they realised how serious it was, I started chemotherapy the next day. Such was the urgency to start chemotherapy that Nichola was advised there was not time to undergo fertility preservation. She spent  weeks in hospital, with the treatment leaving her unable to walk and having to be fed through a tube due to muscositis. Nichola lost three stone during her time at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and had to be helped by nurses to move around. She praised the dedicated medics who supported her during her treatment. Although they were also clearly short staffed, I never felt like it impacted my care at all, she said. Nichola was finally discharged in August, and a month later she was given the welcome news that her cancer is in remission. Still suffering from chronic fatigue and struggling to walk long distances, Nichole is hoping to be able toto work in the New Year. Iaposm much better but Iaposm still being quite slow, Iaposm still struggling a lot with a lot of pain. Iaposm getting there, I still have a lot of fatigue, but Iaposm really eager to get back to work, I will hopefully start looking for something after Christmas. In the meantime Nichola is determined to do something to support Blood Cancer UK, a charity who she said has been a huge help during her illness.Over the course of November she has been walking every day in a . mile challenge, and her fundraising page has already raised more than £,.Kate Keightley, head of support and service development, said: “During the peak of the pandemic, we saw far fewer people being diagnosed with blood cancer, and one of the reasons for this could be that some of the symptoms of blood cancer are easily mistaken for Covid. Symptoms such as fatigue, fever and night sweats can sometimes be dismissed or downplayed and the result can be devastating. “More than half of British adults cannot name any symptom of blood cancer despite it being the third biggest cancer killer in the UK. If you have symptoms that cannot be explained and are persistent, you should urgently make an appointment with your GP. While it is unlikely to be anything serious, it’s so important to get checked out.”To sponsor Nichola and support Blood Cancer UK, click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsCancerHodgkins lymphoma\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Little Eris unexpectedly entered the world at  weeks and five days, weighing the same as a small can of soup at lb oz. She was placed straight into a plastic bag to keep her vital organs warm - preventing the risk of hypothermia - whilst mum Cayce Lee, , was under general anaesthetic following the emergency c-section. Cayce,  and her husband Dennis, , prepared to say goodbye on more than one occasion during the  days in the neonatal intensive care unit . Cayce, from Lewisville, North Carolina US, said: “I was always quite nervous when I was pregnant with Eris as I had a stillbirth before. “The doctors stitched my cervix shut to prevent an early breach, and I was having progesterone injections from about  weeks.  “At  weeks, the doctor’s found that I was already dilated by two centimetres. “I managed to last another three weeks, which helped us to get Eris over the threshold where medical staff could intervene to save her le. After going into labour, Cayce was put under anaesthetic as a surgical team performed an emergency c-section, placing Eris into a sandwich bag before racing to place her in the NICU on a ventilator.After her birth, Eris developed a series of health problems, including a staph infection caused by bacteria, pneumonia, and sepsis.At one point, Eris was also put on a le support machineafter being coming extremely ill, and unable to breathe alone.  Her parents were told to say goodbye on more than one occasion.

She added: “Her lungs were the main problem, as she really struggled to breathe alone. “She was pretty much on all the maxed-out settings on the ventilator. Cayce first got to hold Eris at one and a half weeks, whilst husband Dennis was only able to hold her after seven weeks due to Erisapos fragile state, alongside Covid- restrictions. It was several weeks before Cayce was able to hold Eris once more. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

Carla Bellucci was hammered online after admitting she faked depression to get a £, nose job on the NHS.The OnlyFans mum says her kids Jermaine, , Tanisha,  and Jayden,  are still having to suffer at the hands of trolls after her confession in . Now the social media star, who welcomed her fourth child Blue Gianna last month, says she needs to make sure they have a great Christmas after a dficult few years. Carla, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, says the family were forced to leave their home in Borehamwood after her TV interview. The -year-old says she owes it to them to make it one to remember - and has a big budget to play with thanks to her online earnings.Speaking to Fabulous, she said: “I am looking at a budget of at least £, - there were times when I really struggled even to feed my kids so I really want to make this year special now that I can.  “My kids have been through so much over the years what with the trolling I get twinned with me being in the papers, they often get picked on because of me. “Obviously spending money on them doesn’t make up for that but I do want to give them the Christmas they really deserve.” Earlier this year she claimed other mothers on the school run have called her a aposs**gapos behind her back.The former Page  model claims to have made more than £, by sharing pregnancy pictures on her OnlyFans account.She says some of the mums at her childrenaposs school have actually signed up to her page as they are aposdesperateapos to see her content.Carla told the Daily Star : The school run is horric – mums stand and gossip non stop.

I have heard that they have also held meetings about me – it’s all crazy beyond me!

And not only that, some follow Carla on the adult subscription site purely to spy on what she’s getting up to. She said: I have proof that mums are the ones who troll – they do it off their own accounts it never shocks me how dumb they can be.

Daughter Princess Anne and the Queen’s racing manager John Warren are the two people she will speak to and both of these callers can get through to her majesty from anywhere in the world. Royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti made the claim about the Queen’s dialling habits, adding that she uses a Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI. Mr Sacerdoti told US presenter Christina Garibaldi: “Apparently the Queen has two people who she speaks to the most on her phones and she also apparently has a mobile phone which is said to be Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI so nobody can hack into her phone. “But the two people she phones the most are said to be her daughter Princess Anne and her racing manager John Warren.” And particularlyJohn calls, “she answers”. “He is the son-in-law of the Queen’s friend, the late Earl of Carnarvon and his home was Highclere castle in Berkshire which viewers of TV may know better as Downton Abbey.”John is one of the world’s leading horsemen and oversees all of the Queen’s racing and breeding interests. Her royal majesty has been involved with horses for over  years and first attended the Royal Ascot in  aged  years old, according to Britain Magazine. And it seems the Queen has an unbreakable bond with her only daughter Anne despite having multiple other children to favour. Their relationship has been captured over the years in photographs, that show the pair coordinate fashion styles and colour schemes. And with a nod to this, the Queen published a series of heartwarming photos to mark Anneaposs st birthday on Sunday  August. Perhaps the pair bonded over horse riding and all things equestrian as it has been a le-time hobby for both. The monarch has been praised for her work-ethic and Anne has followed in her footsteps too by attending royal engagements yearly, reports Hello Magazine.

Researchers have developed a detailed questionnaire that owners can use to analyse their indecipherable feline friends to seethey possess psychopathic tendencies. The test, named the CAT-Tri+, comes in the form of  statements that require owners to rate how well each one describes their pet.The study was carried out by a group of scientists from the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University and has been published in the Journal of Research in Personality. Based on the relationship between , owners and their cats, the test marks the first-ever tool available to measure psychopathy in cats.  Owners must rank on a five-point scale statements including: “My cat torments their prey rather than killing it straight away”, “my cat vocalises loudlyfor no apparent reason”, and “my cat is very excitable ”.Other statements include observing whether your cat sits in high places, whether they “dominate” the neighbourhood cats, and whether they purr when attacking people or animals.The results help measure the cat’s levels of “meanness” – traits such as a lack of empathy and callous aggression – “disinhibition” as in issues with behavioural restraint, “boldness” as well as its level of unfriendliness towards people and other pets.  Lead researcher Rebecca Evans of Liverpool University said: “In our study, we developed a questionnaire measure of psychopathy in domestic cats. “The questionnaire was developed using owner-provided examples of their cat’s behaviour in the context of the triarchic model of psychopathy . “The final questionnaire measures five factors of feline psychopathy: boldness, meanness, disinhibition, pet-unfriendliness and human-unfriendliness.”  She continued: “A cat that has a high score on the boldness scale may benefit from large cat trees and tall scratching posts, as the Cat-Tri+ items suggest that a bold cat enjoys exploring and climbing. “Providing environmental enrichment for bold cats may reduce agonistic behaviours towards people, other pets, and possessions.” Researchers hope the test will help improve relationships between cats and their owners, and in turn reduce the number of pets that end up in shelters or being put down.  Ms Evans added: “Behavioural issues such as aggression – conceptually related to meanness – and disobedience, conceptually related to disinhibition, are reported as the reason for around % of cat relinquishments to UK shelters. “Euthanasia of unwanted animals is also the leading cause of death for domestic cats. “That is why it is important that we seek to understand how feline personality affects the quality of the cat-owner relationship.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Liverpool John Moores UniversityUniversity of LiverpoolCatsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Danielle Thornton first noticed her legs becoming swollen at the age of  and, despite being a fit and active teenager, she found herself being bullied due to her physical appearance. The -year-old woman said she visited doctors constantly over the past  years and after being labelled as obese, she tried many dferent diets. Danni, a proposal manager from Coventry, said she also walked , steps per day and visited the gym daily in a bid to shrink her legs, but nothing worked.  After visiting a specialist in London in July, she was diagnosed with Lipoedema, an incurable disease caused by an abnormal build-up of fat cells in ious parts of the body. Not only does Danni struggle with her appearance, she now suffers excruciating pain every day and is unable to get out of bed or walk across the room without being in agony as her condition has progressed. Despite her healthy and active lestyle, the circumference of both her thighs and calves increased by cm in just a few months and is continuing to grow.The NHS and Danniaposs own private medical insurance will not cover treatment for Lipoedema - which involves removing the fat from her legs - because it is considered to be cosmetic surgery. Danni, who has a size  waist but has to wear size  trousers in order to get them over her legs, said: I hate the way I look but itaposs not just about that, the pain is unbearable. Itaposs horric at times. I find myself dragging my feet and legs across the floor because they just feel too heavy for me to move. Iaposve been in constant agony since I was a teenager and itaposs only getting worse. I went to an all-girls secondary school and became aware of a dference between me and the other girls almost instantly. I was very athletic and into dance and drama, I started to get an hourglass waist but my legs were huge. I looked like I had been sewn together completely wrong.  Iaposve never been able to wear boots because they wonapost fit around my calves and I live in baggy trousers because nothing  fits. Treatment wonapost cure it but it will make the condition easier to live with and without sounding dramatic that would honestly change my le. Danni has recently set up a GoFundMe page and hopes to raise £, so that she can travel to Poland for specialist treatment - which involves removing  litres of Lipoedema fat from her legs in a single operation. Her condition affects her legs, bottom, stomach and arms, but as her legs cause her the most pain she is desperate for help with those.  She added: Despite the fact that I was exercising and eating a healthy diet, I couldnapost figure out why my legs were getting bigger. I had constant doctor visits where I was told that I simply needed to go on a diet, that I was obese, that I should try water tablets, and that I should move more but I had a feeling there was something wrong with my health.I would not have recognised the symptomsit hadnapost been for the other ladies speaking out about Lipoedema on Facebook and Instagram.Iaposm not normally the type to ask for help and I am continuing to save as much money as I can but the costs involved are extortionate. I just want to reduce the pain so that I can enjoy my le and help make others aware of the condition.To make a donation, you can click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Obesity\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He stated his brother Thomas Hughes, who is jointly accused of murder, went aposwithin himselfapos when he started a relationship with Tustin and started to lose ties with his family.Tustin, , and Hughes, , have denied murder and multiple counts of child cruelty. It is alleged they apossystematicallyapos abused Arthur during the first coronavirus lockdown before he collapsed of fatal head injuries at their home in Cranmore Road, Shirley on June  last year.He died the following morning in hospital after doctors concluded he could not be saved and switched his le support off.The trial at Coventry Crown Court resumed yesterday after a number of issues ground proceedings to a halt for more than three days this week.On Monday, the jury was told that Tustin had been taken to hospital due to concerns over her health. This afternoon Judge Wall stated she had been assessed and deemed fit to continue. He also confirmed one juror has now been discharged on health grounds and reiterated a previous direction to the remainder of the  to ignore media coverage of the case. As the only witness to give evidence yesterday, Andrew Hughes described his first impression of Tustin as aposvery, very coldapos. He stated his brotheraposs relationship with her moved aposvery quicklyapos and that Thomas Hughes soon became aposstricterapos on Arthur by punishing him for minor things that aposwerenapost an issue beforeapos. Mr Hughes added his brother found it aposincreasingly hardapos to spend time with Arthur because Tustin would aposmake an effort to interveneapos.  He told the court the last time he saw Arthur was around a week before the first lockdown in March  and said: He seemed far more timid. He seemed more aware he may get in trouble. There was this voice Arthur would sometimes make, referred to as his baby voice. Before it was never an issue but it became an issue not long after Ms Tustin came on the scene. Mr Hughes stated his brother was aposvery warmapos with a aposstrong belief in familyapos prior to meeting Tustin. Describing his impression of his brother afterwards he added: He went within himself. With his immediate family, mom, dad, brothers, the ties seemed to become weaker and weaker. He didnapost seem to be invested in keeping that strong. In cross-examination Mr Hughes was askedthought everything that happened to Arthur was Tustinaposs fault, to which he replied: I believe sheaposs the catalyst for it. He denied he had intentionally walked in front of her in just his shorts to aposshow offapos, although acknowledged his brother told him off for doing so.  He stated he found nothing attractive about Tustin and said: She was domineering. If she didnapost get what she wanted she would make things dficult for everyone . Reiterating his view of her Mr Hughes added: A cold, manipulating, calculating person who made every attempt to stay away from the family and draw my brother from the family as well. It has previously been alleged Tustin and Thomas Hughes made Arthur spend up to  hours a day isolated in their hallway, assaulted him, deprived him of food and water as well as poisoned him with salt. The prosecution has argued Hughes encouraged violence towards his son but that Tustin carried out the fatal attack while she was alone with him at the Cranmore Road address. The trial began in early October and today Judge Wall told the jury they could be sent out to reach verdicts as early as next Wednesday.

Colleen Smith had only recently moved in with Samantha Hart and Charlie Olding, who she considered to be friends, when the couple dragged her into their cellar where they filmed themselves raping her. Some of the stomach-churning attack was filmed by Oldingaposs cousin Lee Kitchiner, who was  at the time. The couple have since been jailed and Colleen, , has bravely decided to waive her anonymity to encourage other victims to seek help.Speaking to the Daily Star, she said she has been “scarred for le” and has nightmares in which she wakes up screaming.“What they did was make me feel not wanted, ashamed and lonely,” she said. “I sometimes get voices in my head telling me I’m worthless. I was a happy and lively person but now I’m down and depressed.“I am just a broken person now.” Colleen, from Medway, Kent, moved in with the couple in October  and found the pair “constantly argued” creating a tense atmosphere in the house. Three weeks after moving, on September , Colleen headed out with a friend to the pub, where they enjoyed some drinks. But at some point during the night, Olding and Hart began to call her. Colleen recalled: “I even said to my friend it was weird because they never ring me that much. My mate told me not to go back and she had an instinct that something was going to happen. I told her not to be silly and that nothing will happen. “I thought they were my friends.” Colleen’s pal gave her a lt to the home in Chatham, Kent, and the vile abuse started shortly after. Hart, Olding and Kitchiner were waiting for her in the alleyway beside the property, where they “smacked” Colleen in the face before throwing her phone onto train tracks. She was then dragged into the home and ordered to go down to the cellar. Colleen said: “I have never been a fighter and I don’t like arguments so I was more shocked than anything. I was totally shocked like ‘why would you do this ’ and it was just very confusing. “I hoped it was a dream and I was going to wake up any minute, but obviously it wasn’t a dream.” Colleen said she was eventually forced to perform a sex act on Olding, while being filmed. Next, Olding proceeded to rape her as the others watched.  She said: “I was trying my hardest to tell them to stop but they wouldn’t stop. “I could see they were filming and I was thinking in my head are they going to send this to my friends  Are they going to send this to people so they can laugh at me and that’s what I was worried about. I didn’t knowI was going to live or not.” The brutality lasted six hours before the trio eventually went upstairs to go to bed. At this point, around .am, a badly hurt Colleen decided to try and flee, legging it to a friend’s house. “I thought apos I don’t run I will die - If I don’t run Iaposm gone and my family won’t even knowapos,” she said. Colleen reached her friend’s home and the police arrived  minutes later. She was taken to hospital with a suspected broken eye socket and the despicable trio were arrested. Colleen was eventually diagnosed with PTSD before she bravely gave evidence via video link during the trial at Maidstone Crown Court earlier this year. The court was shown more than  video clips from Olding’s phone of the brutal assault. Hart and Olding,  and , from Chatam, Kent, were convicted of rape and causing a person to engage in sexual activity - receiving  and  years respectively.  Meanwhile Kitchiner, now , from Strood, Kent, was found guilty of the sexual activity offence and was cleared of rape and assault. He was handed a two-year custodial sentence suspended for two years, along with  hours of unpaid work,  rehabilitation sessions, and a -month curfew. Judge Philip Statman said: “Each of you made callous, disgusting remarks about how this act should be performed. “It caused your victim to be violated and she felt embarrassed and disgusted by what she was being told to do. This was a grave attack of a sexual nature perpetrated on your victim.” Colleen added: “I wanted to go to the sentencing to look them in the eye to show them what they have done to me but I couldn’t. But I thought it was an amazing sentence because I feared they would be let free. “I hope they get what they deserve in prison for what they did to me.” Colleen is now taking things one day at a time and dreams of one day being her old self, able to live her le the way she wants, independently, without looking over her shoulder. “Thankfully my mum and my siblings have got me through this. If it wasn’t for them I don’t think I would be here,” she said. “I’m not going to say I’m doing really well but I’m getting there. I am starting to be me again, well trying to. It has been so hard.” Colleen wants to now speak out to encourage other survivors who may be dealing with trauma alone to get support. She said: “Don’t be scared to speak about what you have been through. Please tell someone, I’ve learned thatyou tell someone you can get the support you need. “It’s so important not to bottle it up like I did.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCourt caseCrown courtCrimeRape\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The World Health Organisation warned evidence suggests the iant, labelled Omicron in its Greek alphabet naming convention, has an increased risk of re-infection and may sp rapidly. The iant should have been called Nu but the WHO believes that would be confused with the word “new”, so used the next letter – omicron. From midday today, the UK halted flights from six countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, in an urgent statement in the Commons, told the public: “If you’ve arrived from any of these countries in the last  days, NHS Test and Trace will be asking you to take a PCR test.“But please don’t wait to be contacted. You should take PCR tests right away.” He added: “It is highly likely it has spread to other ­countries. We are concerned this iant may pose substantial risk to public health.” Almost , people have arrived from South Africa in the past two weeks. Around  cases of Omicron had been found by genetic sequencing in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. The European ­Commission has ­recommended an EU-wide travel ban to and from southern Africa.  Experts fear history could repeat itself a year after the Alpha iant triggered a Christmas lockdown. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, warned: “We all need to be ready for the possibility of a change in the restrictions.” Mr Javid said the Government is still following its Plan A but warned, “ we need to go further, we will”. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of the Covid- Genomics UK ­Consortium, said we may only be able to “buy time” before the Omicron iant gets in to Britain.  She said: “Once a new iant of concern emerges, and it’s fitter than the previous iant, it can be ­dficult to stop it going into a country unless you have very, very ­stringent lockdown rules.” Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “It is the most worrying we have seen.” Askedit could already be in Britain, she said: “It’s always possible.”  Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: “This is a huge worry. The molecular data would point to perhaps this thing being able to evade the immune response.” And England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty told the Local Government Association his greatest fear is people would not adhere to another lockdown after “two years of their lives being interfered with”.  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said any spread “could coincide with what we’re expecting to be an extremely ­dficult winter”. Carol Popplestone, council chair of the Royal College of Nursing, called for swt action. She urged: “The Government must reintroduce compulsory face coverings immediately and set out further steps in the coming days.” Welsh rugby teams Cardf and Scarlets were trying tofrom South Africa, and  UK and Ireland golfers have quit the Johannesburg Open. Tourists from the UK landing in Cape Town wept when they were told South Africa was “red listed”. Anna DeMarigny, , of Galway, Ireland, had flown in to see her terminally ill friend.  She said: “My daughter is due to visit me from San Francisco with her baby. I can’t go into quarantine. I’m going to have to cut short my stay.” Tony Haupt, , of Oxford, had arrived to visit five of his six ­children. He said: “I hope I get back in time for my daughter’s graduation.” Mr Javid said the ban on flights is temporary while the UK re-established its Red List hotel ­quarantine scheme. But Dr Angelique Coet­­zee, of the South African Medical ­Association, said the travel restrictions are “like a storm in a teacup.” Downing Street said Boris Johnson had spoken to South Africa’s ­president Cyril Ramaphosa, saying: “The PM commended South Africa’s leadership in transparently sharing data.”AstraZeneca said it is hopeful that its antibody cocktail will retain ­efficacy against the omicron iant. England’s weekly R number has risen above one to between . and ., estimates suggest. In the latest -hour period, , infections were recorded, the highest daily count for over a month.

The Thursday evening announcement meant that South Africa was added to the list from Friday at pm, so all flights were suspended and those arriving in the UK were forced to isolate for  days. From am on Sunday, this quarantine period will need to take place in a hotel. Countless Brits, including Jessica and Michael Dickinson were caught in the sudden announcement, and now find themselves stranded in South Africa, currently with no way home. Jessica, , described the situation as a “worst nightmare come true”. They had had their daughter Amelia-Rose, -months-old, during the pandemic, and none of their relatives from South Africa had seen her yet, so once restrictions lted, the pair booked a trip out to introduce her to her family. “Many people haven’t been home for quite some time, but we had our daughter and wanted her to meet the rest of her family. “When the borders opened we thought it was a great opportunity to come and see our family, we’d had a couple deaths in the family, so we thought it was important to make the trip out. “We moved to the UK and have been here for  years, we recently had our daughter and have had no family support raising her. Nobody’s met her, this was an opportunity for them to at least meet her, because people are getting old and you never know when it will be somebody’s last time.” After flying out last week, the family from Surrey were due totonight. The first they knew about the announcement was when Amelia woke Jessica up crying, and she checked her phone to see messages from a friend about it. However, as they were due toon Friday they thought they would be okay to fly home as usual. Then they got an email from British Airways saying their flight was cancelled. “It’s literally just a snowball effect of everything, getting home, my daughter being sick, jobs,” Jessica said. “My daughter’s also not been very well, she’s had a bad chest infection and I’ve been keen to get her back to the UK to have her looked at so this has really thrown us off. “In the morning , we went down for breakfast and we overheard some other Brits talking about how they were all trying to rush off. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. “There were people rushing to get PCR tests and take flights that had like three stayovers. But we can’t do that, we have our daughter.” Jessica described how they had sat on the phone for hours trying to get through to ious airlines to no avail, and even how the British consulate was “useless”. “Both me and my husband are due to start back at work on Monday, but I don’t have my work laptop and we have to figure out childcare this side, whilst still paying for our nursery that side. “It’s been relentless.  “We nearly finalised another flight with Emirates on Tuesday evening, and were ready to pay until it was cancelled. “We understand we’ll have to do the hotel quarantine but we’re worried about doing it with our daughter and I’m ADHD. I’m worried about what it’s going to be like on the other side. I get that’s what it needs to be like to get back home. On the journey back they face a bill of thousands because of the government’s actions as they have to book new flights and then pay for hotel quarantine too. British Airways, like all airways operating to and from South Africa from the UK, learned about the governmentaposs ban the same time as everyone . Given no prior-warning, they were left scrambling to try and organise a way home for the Brits stuck abroad whilst having very little to no guidance from the government. They have set up a dedicated phone line for Brits in South Africa and now Jessica, Michael and Amelia have a flight booked in for the th to get them home.

Iaposd play them for her and sheaposd wag her tail and smile,” Shonae says. The pup quickly worked out that she could play the wind chimes herself by nudging her nose against them. She would attract Shonae’s attention in order to show her owner her “latest musical masterpiece”. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family.

Koira loved playing the chimes so much that Shonae bought the dog her very own set - and the pup seemed delighted with her gt. “We randomly hear her play them throughout the day,” Shonae says. “We just laugh and shake our heads. She is extremely unique.” Koira isn’t the only musically-minded collie that people have been watching lately.This dog had such impressive singing skillsthat London’s Royal Opera House dropped him a line.After a clip of Nico showing off his amazing operatic range went viral on TikTok, his skills were compared to the likes of Ave Maria and Phantom of the Opera.

Sheaposd spent two weeks decorating the basement and picking up ingredients before cooking a delicious Thanksgiving dinner for all her friends.Sadly her aposfriendsapos stood her up and according to Christian, they didn’t even bother to let her know that they wouldn’t be attending.In a video on TikTok, Christian explained: My girlfriend was so excited for her first Friendsgiving but no one showed up. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here She decorated the whole basement and cooked so much food. I keep trying to cheer her up but nothing is working. He showed off the lavishly decorated space and tables laden with food - as well as the empty seats beside his partner, who looks close to tears. He added: I’m so sad for her. In the comment section, people flocked to share their outrage at her so-called friends, with one viewer writing: This is the problem nowadays. No integrity, no honour, no appreciating or value in our connections. Glad she had a happy ending. In a follow-up video, Christian said that after Maryannaposs pals failed to show up, he took matters into his own hands. My girl and her friends decided to throw a Friendsgiving like two weeks in advance, they were planning this for two weeks, he explained. They were planning everything, everything was all set – the date, the time, and everything. They were all gonna come. But the day came and no one was answering the group chat. No one was texting or calling, but in her mind, she thought everyone was running late. When it hit the three-hour mark, she was like: aposYeah no one’s gonna come.apos She called me and told me what happened so I started heading over to her house. On the way there, I called my friends. I told my friends, “Hey, are you [open to] coming to my girls Thanksgiving ”‘ he added. They were more than gracious enough to come. They all came and brought stuff. It’s like she had her own Friendsgiving, there was a happy ending to it. She wasn’t upset, she wasn’t mad, she was kind of disappointed about her actual friends not showing up but other than that, she still had great company and she still had a great time.

Sometimes the waist is too loose and the bum is too tight, others youaposve got the perfectbut you need to size up.And, sometimes, as what happened with one lady, youaposre left with legs so long you may as well try and use them as flippers, because youaposd have more luck swimming with them than walking down the street.Thataposs exactly what happened to TikTok user Melanie Wilmoth @melaniewilmoth , when she ordered a pair of scrunched up, flared blue jeans from retailer giant Shein.  Melanie, who works as a personal trainer, decided to treat herself to the s-style trousers, which appear to be designed to be worn in a bunched up fashion.But, when the trousers arrived, it turned out they werenapost bunched together by stitches like you might expect instead they were just really, really long.Melanie took to TikTok to share a screenshot taken from the Shein website, before sharing a clip of herself wearing the jeans, and itaposs fair to say the dference is stark. Alongside the clip, she wrote: Shein, count your days! But, not everyone was impressed, with many commenting to point out the jeans are supposed to be pulled up. Girl, pull the pants up and itaposll literally be the picture, one commented, while another added: So we all agree itaposs her and not the pants. In follow up clip, Melanie took her followersapos advice and decided to pull up the jeans, before coming to the conclusion that they werenapost the right style for her.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13244774.jpg?type=article-full","title":"heritage-buffs-christmas-gift-guide","story":"The Real Mary Kingrsquos Close voucherSome say itrsquos haunted.

, has reached Belgium after being discovered in South Africa.The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains.A number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is ldquohuge international concern surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective, and it may hinder one of the UKrsquos Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a ldquovery, very, very dficult situation.The EU, US and Canada all followed Britainrsquos move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants.:Devi Sridhar admits worry super-iant could already be in ScotlandExperts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an ldquoincreased risk of reinfection and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a ldquogrowth advantage.Novavax said it has ldquoalready initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks.Moderna said: ldquoSince early , Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new iants of concern.ldquoThis strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized  microgbooster dose of mRNA- prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron iant.Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the event of a iant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects ldquoto be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval.AstraZeneca said it has ldquodeveloped, in close collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine  that enables us to respond quickly to new iants that may emerge and is ldquoalready conducting research in locations where the iant has been identied.The firm is also testing its antibody combination drug against the new iant and is ldquohopeful it ldquowill retain efficacy since it comprises two potent antibodies with dferent and complementary activities against the virus.Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the Omicron iant.He told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that most of the mutations are in similar regions seen in other iants so far, adding: ldquoThat tells you that despite those mutations existing in other iants the vaccines have continued to prevent serious disease as wersquove moved through Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.ldquoAt least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new iant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed.ldquoItrsquos extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year is going to happen.Prof Pollard said a new vaccine to combat Omicron could begin ldquovery rapidlyrequired.ldquoThe processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well-oiled, soitrsquos needed that is something that could be moved very rapidly.:Why the latest Covid iant has scientists scaredNo cases of the new strain have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium ndash after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel ndash has heightened concerns.Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later.The six African countries were added to the UKrsquos travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days.Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested.Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government ldquowonrsquot hesitate to actwe need to do so.Boris Johnson held a call with South Africarsquos president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon after foreign minister Naledi Pandor said the flight ban ldquoseems to have been rushed.The Prime Minister ldquocommended South Africarsquos rapid genomic sequencing and its ldquoleadership in transparently sharing scientic data, Downing Street said.ldquoThey discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid- iant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel, a statement said.Prof Edmunds said the new strain ldquois a huge worry and that ldquoall the data suggests it would be able to evade current immunity.ldquoOur fears are it would do so to a large extent, he told BBC Radio rsquos PM programme.Prof Edmunds urged ministers to look at extending travel restrictions and to prepare a plan to deal with Omicron because ldquoat some point wersquore going to get this iant here in the UK.Professor Calum Semple, another Sage adviser, told BBC Breakfast: ldquoIf you can slow the virus coming into the country because yoursquore timed for the booster campaign to get ahead of it, and itleaves the scientists to seethere is anything to worry about, which it doesnrsquot seem it.ldquoThe virus will get here by hook or crook, eventually, it will come here as people are asymptomatic, but it doesnrsquot mean we shouldnrsquot try and slow it down.He said he is an advocate of masks and hand-washing and said: ldquoI feel particularly uncomfortable on public transport. Irsquom pro-mask in the shops and public transport. We still have high levels of coronavirus but the vaccines are working.Professor Semple encouraged people to get their coronavirus booster vaccines.Professor Brendan Wren, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said people should ldquostay calm and not overreact, adding that scientists can ldquoeasily mody vaccines to meet new iants.Striking an optimistic tone in the Daily Mail, he wrote: ldquoIn the arms race against the virus, humanity is winning ndash and we are well prepared.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

Although many tourist attractions were closed, we had an amazing holiday, walking the wild and stunningly beautul coastline daily, whatever the weather. For the most part, we were solitary walkers, but when we did meet people, usually residents, they were very friendly and helpfulwe looked lost. The moorland reminded us of home , especially the low mist and rain, but the heather is more stunted, unsurprising given the strength of the wind coming straight off the Atlantic or North Sea.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

Today, I have seven teachers off and four other staff. That is an absolute nightmare to manage. “On Monday, I had to contact the board of governors and agree that we would suspend Year  and  classes to allow us to cover junior classes for the day.”The school is back to blended learning, with all year groups studying from home one day a week.“We have to do that until further notice until I know my staff are back,” Mr Walsh said.

The Northern Ireland Substitute Teacher Register is there to call, but you can phone all day and nobody gets back to you. When you finally get someone, they tell you they’re already working, so it’s a waste of time.”Askedschools were getting enough guidance from the Department of Education, he replied: “We were told we could come back and remove our bubble system. In terms of guidance, there really isn’t any. They’re leaving that to schools to deal with themselves.”Alison Steen, the head of Drumrane Primary School, near Limavady, and the president of the Ulster Teachers’ Union, said she had similar problems.She agreed it was “very dficult” to get substitute teachers and said all schools had been forced to consider cancelling mass gatherings to keep students and staff safe.Ms Steen stressed that ato remote learning before Christmas was the last thing anyone wanted.“We want to keep children in schoolat all possible. I know of principals who are ringing a hundred subs in an evening to try and get cover for the next day, so they really are trying to keep classes open,” she said.Teaching unions have called on Education Minister Education Minister Michelle McIlveen to immediately publish guidance on keeping the transmission of Covid under control.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents teaching and support staff unions, urged the minister to cancel all Christmas shows, assemblies and parent-teacher nights.The Department of Education said it was aware schools had been facing extra pressure during the pandemic.It added that were “currently no plans toto remote learning across all schools”. A spokesperson for the department said the Executive’s response to the Covid crisis was based on medical and scientic advice. They added: “The department is aware of the ongoing dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence, and acknowledges that inidual schools may need to consider a short period of remote learning for a class or classes, in response to local circumstances.“There are currently no plans for any school circuit breakers. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of EducationLiam Neeson’s pride as Ballymena’s first integrated primary opens PremiumViewpointOpinionQuestions over wisdom of AQE testsEducation Minister extends Covid- support for childcare providersMore than  reports of  school TikTok accounts reported since October, reveals PSNICall for social media companies to take action to stamp out abuse from ‘rate your teacher’ Tik Tok videosMost ReadWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayBlack Friday queues as GO Stations drop their fuel price by p Per LitreLatest Northern IrelandStormont’s £k spend on vaccine ad campaignDeclaration opposing the Brexit Protocol signed in  Orange HallsTributes to ‘renowned educationalist’ who died after car was hit by falling treeSlaughtneil role a real honour, says pregnant Siobhán Bradley ahead of Ulster Camogie finalJohn Cooney: I’m retaining my focus despite unclear Ulster futureLatestWest End theatres to dim lights in tribute to late composer Stephen SondheimDowning Street protest calls for safe passage across the ChannelLurgan’s school-run path driver hunted by policeBukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fire Arsenal to win over NewcastleAuthor offers free children’s book to families struggling this Christmas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was also an apt description of the dark and heavy rain clouds hanging over Belfast city centre on Friday.Retailers would have been hoping for a constant ringing of tills, but the miserable weather — with storm Arwen bringing gales, downpours and even hailstones — clearly had put people off from hitting the shops and had them logging online instead. Read MoreBargain hunters reign in the rain as NI shoppers get that Black Friday feelingEven the popular Christmas market at Belfast City Hall appeared to be lighter on festive cheer.Although footfall appeared to be fairly brisk, lots of people were zigzagging across the main throughfares minus shopping bags — a sight that would disappoint store owners.And of those who were carrying bags, it was the familiar Primark logo that was a frequent occurrence, despite the retailer being one of a handful of big high street names, along with BM and Next, to shun the event.Zara appeared to be a popular choice, with the Royal Avenue store buzzing with fashion fans snapping up items with discounts of %.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sports fashion retailer JD Sports also appeared to be enticing in customers with what it had billed was its ‘biggest ever Black Friday’.Keen to take advantage of the bargains was Kilkeel man Brendan McVeigh who took the opportunity of Black Friday to make an overnight stay in Belfast.Laden with shopping bags displaying brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Mac and TKMaxx, the -year-old said the breadth of deals was not as evident this year.“The likes of Jack Wills would have had % off and it’s not happening this year. So it’s a bit dferent,” he said.“We went for clothes for the kids this year. My we Sharon works for the NHS so some stores are giving an extra discount for NHS workers.”In Fountain Lane, west Belfast woman Francine Finnegan said she wasn’t particularly fussed by all of the Black Friday hype, insisting that for her, it was just a typical day to pop to the shops.“I was in Gordon Chemists and they had a couple of things I was interested in discounted,” she said.“For me it’s just a normal shopping day. I didn’t come in for Black Friday especially, I just happened to be in the town.”Picking up the best deals wasn’t the number one priority, with the biting, blustery winds focusing Francine’s mind where.“I’m off to get a nice warm cup of tea,” she laughed.Nearby, friends Victoria Smith and Rebecca Thomas had hit the ground running with their hands full of shopping bag and one particular store had them parting with their hard-earned money.“There were some great discounts on their gt sets and things like that,” said Victoria.Rebecca added: “It’s been a pretty good Black Friday.”Belfast retailers, many of whom have been financially hit hard by the impact of lockdown restrictions, will have their fingers crossed they can say the same when they come to tally up the takings.  Most ReadWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayBlack Friday queues as GO Stations drop their fuel price by p Per LitreLatest Northern IrelandStormont’s £k spend on vaccine ad campaignDeclaration opposing the Brexit Protocol signed in  Orange HallsTributes to ‘renowned educationalist’ who died after car was hit by falling treeSlaughtneil role a real honour, says pregnant Siobhán Bradley ahead of Ulster Camogie finalJohn Cooney: I’m retaining my focus despite unclear Ulster futureLatestLeinster vs Ulster LIVE: John Cooney back from injury as provinceto league actionArsenal’s young stars rewarded ‘real trust’ – Mikel ArtetaPlaid Cymru members green light co-operation deal with LabourSwinney: Devolution at threat from Westminster Government rotten to the coreWest End theatres to dim lights in tribute to late composer Stephen Sondheim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A new investigation into the incident will now be held.Sinn Fein councillor Ruairi McHugh had previously raised the matter at the July council meeting, describing the event as descending into a ‘sectarian hatefest’. He also pointed out that the council-maintained car park was ‘bedecked in loyalist and unionist flags and paraphernalia’.The concert, at Albert Street car park in Castlederg, had been allocated £, from the council’s Good Relations Fund. Councillors voted in favour of the investigation with the funding withheld until the outcome was reported.In a report to the health and communities committee, it noted that members should “approve that Grant Aid payments are made to Castlederg Young Loyalists in line with the terms and conditions of their Letter of Offer within the Good Relations Grant Aid Programmes”.It added: “The organisers are aware that an inidual, under the influence of alcohol, made sectarian comments following a performance by one of several acts on the night of July . This was dealt with promptly by the organisers.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It added: “Whilst this incident was unfortunate, it could not be determined to be the fault of the organisers.

We haven’t spoken to anyone outside the event organisers about this.”Defending the report UUP Alderman Derek Hussey said: “I am disappointed with some of the rhetoric around this and the vilication of the organisers of this event on the back of a report which is a very factual account of events as I have heard.DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the report clearly states “there was no breach in terms and conditions”.Members voted against the officer’s recommendation to award the funding with three for, seven against and one abstention.

It is very, very early days yet but the way it has taken hold within an area in South Africa is of concern,” he said.“Within a two-week period it went from one per cent of the positive samples. Today there is some suggestion that it is up to % of positive samples.“That suggests it is out-competing Delta, which is obviously a concern. Again, it’s early days. It’s something that needs to be monitored and taken seriously by the public health authorities and governments.”Prof Ian Young, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, said that “based on the early information we have this is probably the most concerning new iant” since the Delta form of the virus.He said the new B... iant has “a number of changes” compared with forms seen before.“And those may alter its behaviour in a way that makes it more easily transmitted,” he added.Meanwhile, chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride described the iant as a “matter of concern”.“This is undoubtedly a matter of concern. We are taking the action on international travel on a precautionary basis, while we await further evidence on the spread of this iant in South Africa and understand more about it.”Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist, also insisted it was a case of “wait and see”, adding: “There are still many unknowns and only time will tell how impactful B... is, but to be cautious we should act now to slow it down by bolstering border control and surveillance... and taking the usual measures to control virus spread at home.”Fellow Queen’s expert Dr Andrew Kunzmann, an epidemiologist, stressed that he didn’t think “people should panic yet, and calm heads are needed”.“Panic can be counterproductive and just cause people to disengage with the measures that can help to keep them safe,” he explained.“We don’t yet know enough about the new iant to estimate what impact this will have in Northern Ireland.”Dr Kunzmann continued: “However, fast action from governments is needed to delay importation of large numbers of cases whilst we try to improve our understanding of the new iant and get more vaccines and boosters to the people who need it.“Surveillance for new iants is only usefulit leads to swt action when something is flagged.” He admitted that measures such as quarantine for travellers ing from ‘red list’ areas may help “delay” the importing of the strain — along with the vaccination programme – but it is “unlikely to work for ever”.“It seems likely that vaccines will still offer protection against severe disease, and I’d still recommend anyone who isn’t vaccinated to get vaccinated,” he added.“However, new iants make it important to keep your immunity as high as possible, so I would encourage anyone who is offered a booster to take up that offer when possible.”Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s UniversityNorthern Ireland guidance remains unchanged as UK government urges public to take lateral flow tests before Christmas shopping‘Male reproductive health has been largely ignored’ PremiumYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontQueen’s and Ulster staff to stage three-day strike as part of UK-wide action at UK universitiesCreating history project for the Troubles ‘could be done in an unbiased way’Most ReadWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayBlack Friday queues as GO Stations drop their fuel price by p Per LitreLatest Northern IrelandStormont’s £k spend on vaccine ad campaignDeclaration opposing the Brexit Protocol signed in  Orange HallsTributes to ‘renowned educationalist’ who died after car was hit by falling treeSlaughtneil role a real honour, says pregnant Siobhán Bradley ahead of Ulster Camogie finalJohn Cooney: I’m retaining my focus despite unclear Ulster futureLatestWest End theatres to dim lights in tribute to late composer Stephen SondheimDowning Street protest calls for safe passage across the ChannelLurgan’s school-run path driver hunted by policeBukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fire Arsenal to win over NewcastleAuthor offers free children’s book to families struggling this Christmas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His father, who died suddenly in March , competed in triathlons for Ireland and was a member of the North West Triathlon Club. Dannyhas now raised over pound, for mental health and wellbeing organisations across the city. Over his -day challenge, people from across the city and district joined him for sections of his challenge, with others lining routes to cheer him on. Danny thanked the people of Derry saying they “lted him up, and filled him with adrenaline.” He said: “Thank you all so much, from the bottom of my heart, from the sweat on my brow to the blisters on my feet, thank you. And of course, to my daddy, I hope I made you proud big man. Danny spent much of the year training for thechallenge starting on August , which consisted of a. mileswim, followed by a milecycle and then a milemarathon, every day for  consecutive days. At a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Thursday, a motion proposed by Sinn Feacuteins Christopher Jackson and Sandra Duffy, calling for the honour to be bestowed on Mr Quigley, passed unanimously. Councillor Jackson said: “The challenge itself caught the imagination of the city and the most important element of it is the promotion of positive mental health. Danny has raised over pound, for local mental health charities and he has created a lasting legacy. This motion is a way ofacknowledgingDanny, his family and all the supporters that helped him complete this task. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane and DUP Councillor Graham Warke said Danny has brought a city together and said it was something that was very much needed” during such a dficult time. “I’ve never seen anyone  do that,” he said, “The money and awareness he has raised, he is a credit to everybody and to his family.” Sandra Duffy added: “The work that he has done and the awareness he has raised has been absolutely tremendous.“We have a really ordinary citizen who has done an extraordinary thing.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey . Remember something, the best music is right on your doorstep, it isn’t on Facebook, it doesn’t matter about likes on social medial or Spoty numbers, you can’t listen to music on computer, and it will never feel as good as seeing a band live and you can do just thatyou follow this yellow brick roadhttps:nervecentre.ticketsolve shows . You’ll see me at Jeanette’s gig on Sunday in the Nerve Centre, where I should point out her Blood co-conspirator and actual blood relative, sister Noella Hutton will also be playing and feel free to ask why I ended this like the Sopranos mid-  Magee on Music: Bloody Sunday . . .  years on  Special programme of events to mark th anniversary    Magee on Music: Still The Happiest Man in the World  Kevin Magee chats with local artist John Breslin    Magee on Music: New hope withof Stendhal Festival  Music festival at Stendhal - something to be proud of    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One.

Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .

Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24November2021_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 28%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Angry traders in Downpatrick have this week called for tougher action to be taken against teenagers terrorising local businesses.They are demanding that the townrsquos police commanders are provided with additional resources to take the problem and that the courts hand out much stfer sentences.Their call comes amid mounting concern about the behaviour of an umber of juveniles who are verbally abusing and intimidating female staff in shops throughout the town and stealing from businesses.Traders say they are becoming increasingly frustrated that no punitive action is taken against the teenagers when they appear before the courts and that the sentences handed out to them are too light.The current position is so serious that number of shop owners are locking their doors during opening hours and admitting customers only after a visual check.One local trader, who did not want to be named, said the teenagers responsible for the trouble were being allowed to intimidate the business community and suggested an exclusion order should be placed on them, banning them from the town.ldquoThese people have no fear and no shame and walk about the town asthey owned the place. While the police could do more, I realise they may not have all the resources they require at their disposal and this situation also has to be addressed, he declared.BALLYNAHINCH mdash All takeaways in Ballynahinch should be close at midnight to cut down on sectarian trouble in the town, according to a local politician.South Down Assemblyman Jim Wells has called upon Down Council to introduce a blanket closure time on all takeaways claiming that the late opening hours, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, has led to an increase of sectarian trouble in the town.At a meeting of the Corporate Services Committee last week, Mr Wells claimed that a large number of residents living around Main Street are being wakened in the early hours of the morning by drunken youths hanging about the shops.He also pointed out that a large number of violent incidents occur in the early hours outside takeaways in the town.Mr Wells said he received complaints from an  year-old woman living close to a takeaway, who is left terried by drunken shouting at around am on a Saturday and Sunday morning.ldquoI really think it would be a good idea to consider closing these places at midnight. Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

Latest news bulletins are reporting ever increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Covid- in the last few days causing hospitals and intensive care units to be overwhelmed, indeed to breaking point. Millions, many of them children, remain unvaccinated in impoverished countries, and at huge risk to infection, serious illness, and death.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
