More than 100 people, most of them local residents and environmental groups opposing the plan, attended the opening of the hearing. Inidual residents and groups will next week set out their objections to the facility which they said will jeopardise the health of people, wildlife and plants, and will increase pollution in Dublin Bay.In addition to the treatment plant the project includes the construction of an underground orbital sewer from Blanchardstown to Clonshaugh, to intercept existing flows to Ringsend a pumping station at Abbotstown and an outfall pipeline to return the treated water to the Irish Sea approximately 1km north east of Ireland’s Eye.The hearing is expected to continue for two weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela holds hearing over proposed \u0026euro500 million Clonshaugh facilitySuch a scenario would be \u0026ldquovery messy and pretty unpleasant UK\u0026rsquos former Brussels ambassador warnsConcepta Anderson (58) fell during episode in hosptial toilet after pacemaker removedEric Eoin Marques accused of being world\u0026rsquos biggest facilitator of child pornographyConcerns over false information increase ahead of European Parliament elections in MayChildren in 12 schools getting \u0026lsquopsychological first aid\u0026rsquo after deaths in crush outside hotel\u0026euro575,000 legal bill part of settlement in plans for services at Gorey, Kilcullen and Moate.Irish Water seeks permission for State\u0026rsquos second-largest sewage plant inMultidenominational is the fastest growing category of school by ethosJohn Pollock appeared genuinely embarrassed by the massive cost overrunCampaigner: \u0026lsquoHow quickly can you forget the deaths of healthy babies?\u0026rsquoAim is that regulator will self-finance through fees and levies imposed on operatorsTim Shriver on issues for those with disabilities and his wish that games return to IrelandJohn Pollock\u0026rsquos is the fifth resignation from the long-delayed and controversial projectMayors would be \u0026lsquotargetted\u0026rsquo powers on almost all matters except planningDreams come true amid chants of ol\u0026eacute, ol\u0026eacute, ol\u0026eacute at the World Games in Abu DhabiMotor insurance is bill reported to put most people under financial pressurePercentage of people presenting for treatment who are already dependent climbingTaking any version of the drug daily was found to triple the chances of developing psychosisPostmortem at CUH to follow after biker in his 40s pronounced dead at the scene"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3831921.1553032709!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit holders of uk licences face time off road while awaiting new irish permits","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Driver Licence Service said it was illegal for UK licence holders to drive until they get their Irish permits. Photograph: iStockHolders of UK driving licences who have applied to swap them for Irish permits due to Brexit have been told they must stay off the road possibly for weeks while awaiting new licences.There are thousands of UK licence holders in Ireland, who have been advised to change their licences as they will be invalid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Fianna Fáil transport spokesman Robert Troy said the Road Safety Authority (RSA) confirmed to him a demand of up to 500 applications per day was being seen.Amid backlogs caused by a rush of applications for licence exchange, drivers are being told by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) that it is illegal for them to drive until they get their new permits.In correspondence to an affected driver seen by The , a senior NDLS official states: “We would advise that you should not drive while the exchange application is in processing and should wait until you have your Irish driver’s licence physically in your possession.”When holders of a UK licence exchange their permit for its Irish equivalent, they surrender the British version at the driving test centre. They are given a receipt for the new licence, but according to correspondence seen by this newspaper, this is not sufficient to allow them to drive.“It is a legal requirement that when driving in Ireland, the driver must be in possession of a valid driving licence for the class of vehicle driven. A receipt issued by an NDLS Centre states the applicant has applied for a licence but does not grant the bearer permission to drive,” an official told an applicant.Under pressureEmails sent to applicants also show that the turnaround time for licence exchanges slowed down as the system came under pressure. “Please be advised that due to an increase in volume of foreign licence exchanges, an application to exchange a UK licence can take up to 30 working days,” one email from March 12th reads.Those caught up in the process have expressed dismay at being told they could be off the road for more than a month, with fears that public holidays around Easter could further slow down processing times. The NDLS has already been forced to open some centres for additional opening hours, and give priority to UK exchange licences.“If I can’t drive to work, it would add an hour to my commute each day as the public transport route isn’t great,” said one person who is exchanging their licence. The person, who has returned to live in the State after spending some years in the UK, said any delay would also have a significant effect on their personal life. “One of the big advantages of living at home again is being able to see family more often.”“They seriously need to come up with some sort of ‘grandfathering’ rule to at least cover us while we wait,” the person saidThe Road Safety Authority confirmed in response to a parliamentary question from Mr Troy last week that the National Driver Licence System has seen an increase in applications to exchange driving licences from the UK and that daily demand was now at 500 applications per day.“In the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement in place, the driving license of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive in Ireland on that licence,” said chief executive Moyagh Murdock.In recent times the average processing time for a UK licence exchange has been 17 days, but following an increase in resources from the RSA, waiting times were down to 7.5 days as of March 12th, Ms Murdock added, in her letter dated March 13th.Irish exportersSeparately, former minister for finance Michael Noonan has said he is confident Irish exporters will be “able to cope” under a no-deal Brexit.He was speaking in his native Limerick where he officially cut the ribbon on the €17.6 million Gardens International development.Mr Noonan said uncertainty was “bad for business, bad for investment, and bad for trade”.However, he believed exporters could “ride out” a no-deal, adding that Ireland should not be too concerned about Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: EU Council\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May speaking during the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons in London. Photograph: HOPRUAFP PhotoTheresa May has asked the European Union for an extension to Article 50 delaying Brexit by three months, after a revolt among pro-leave ministers and MPs that threatened her premiership. Mrs May told the House of Commons on Wednesday she has written to Donald Tusk, the European Council president, setting out her request to have Brexit delayed until June 30th. The UK will need the approval of all 27 member states for the extension to be granted. However, the European Commission opposes an extension to June 30th, according to an EU document seen by Reuters. In her letter to Mr Tusk, Mrs May said she did not believe it was in either the UK’s or the EU’s interests for Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. She told MPs that she intends to table the Withdrawal Agreement which she has negotiated with the EU for a third time in the Commons next week, in the hope of overturning the massive defeats inflicted on it in January and March. Brussels has made clear that any extension of the article 50 negotiation process beyond the end of June would require the UK to elect MEPs to take their seats in the next European Parliament in July. ‘Unacceptable’Mrs May told MPs: “The idea that three years after voting to leave the EU, the people of this country should be asked to elect a new set of MEPs is, I believe, unacceptable. “It would be a failure to deliver on the referendum decision this House said it would deliver. “I have therefore this morning written to President Tusk... informing him that the UK seeks an extension to the Article 50 period until June 30th.” Mrs May will formally make her request to the European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, where the unanimous approval of all 27 remaining member states is required for any extension. In her letter to Mr Tusk, Mrs May said that it remains the government’s policy to take the UK out of the EU “in an orderly manner” on the basis of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration agreed in November and supplemented by documents agreed with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker last week. The agreement was rejected by 230 votes in January and 149 votes earlier this month. Commons Speaker John Bercow this week said he would not allow the same motion to be brought again during this session of Parliament, unless it was substantially changed. But Mrs May told the Commons: “The Government intends to bring forward proposals for a third meaningful vote. “If that vote is passed, the extension will give the House time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. If not, the House will have to decide how to proceed. “But as prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30th.”‘Binary choice’In a note on the Brexit process reviewed by the European Commission at its weekly meeting on Wednesday, EU officials wrote that leaders meeting Mrs May at a summit in Brussels on Thursday faced a “binary” choice of a short delay of Brexit from March 29th to before May 23rd or a long delay to at least the end of this year, with Britain obliged to hold an election on May 23th for MEPs. “Any extension offered to the United Kingdom should either last until 23 May 2019 or should be significantly longer and require European elections,” the document said. “This is the only way of protecting the functioning of the EU institutions and their ability to take decisions.” EU states which were due to receive additional legislative seats after Brexit would need to know by mid- to late April if they would be denied those seats because Britain was staying. The note also said that in any extended membership, Britain should, “in a spirit of loyal cooperation”, commit to “constructive abstention” on key issues, such as the EU’s long-term budget and filling top EU posts after the May election.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He told of celebrating on Saturday by doing what I was going to do anyway and watching the Wales rugby union team clinch the Six Nations Grand Slam with his father.He said: (We had) slightly fancier beer than we would have, nice Italian beer, sent out for pizza and had some spicy wings - the sort of things millionaires do every Saturday.Mr Goodchild, who has no children, added that watching Wales win had felt more real than the lottery.He claimed he always had a feeling he would win some money in his life.I\u0027ve been doing the lottery since it started and even then before that I thought: \u0027I\u0027ll be rich one day, I\u0027ll have to be lucky to get it\u0027, he said.Lucky is what I turned out to be. I\u0027m just about the happiest bloke you could imagine.He said he had an urge to check his ticket on Saturday, instead of waiting for Monday as usual, and did not realise he had won the jackpot at first when he scanned his ticket on the National Lottery App.It gave me the winning \u0027ping\u0027 sound and I thought I might have won a fiver or something, he said.But when I checked I thought hang on, it looks like I\u0027ve won £71,000.I put my glasses on to double check and then spotted that it was the jackpot prize and that all my numbers were circled. I thought wow, a lot of people have shared the jackpot this week but fair play. Then I read the prize amount again and realised that it was actually £71 million and just one winner - me.It was then that I called my Mum and Dad. Their reaction was one of complete shock - I still don\u0027t think it\u0027s sunk in for them.The winning prize - £71,057,439 - is the 15th highest in British lottery history. Colin and Chris Weir (2011) - £161.7millionAdrian and Gillian Bayford (2012) - £148.7million Frances and Patrick Connolly (2019) - £115m Dave and Angela Dawes (2011) - £101.2millionBritain\u0027s 15th-biggest lottery winner has quit his job and is planning a spending spree after insisting his £71 million EuroMillions jackpot win will change his life.Ade Goodchild has his eye on a new house with a jacuzzi, a few staff and dream holidays to the Grand Canyon and the Pyramids.After going public with his win on Wednesday, he said: There\u0027ll be no more shift work for me. I want to travel, find myself a lovely new home, go to top sporting events, and try many other things besides.I\u0027m not a gardener but I\u0027d like a bit of space for the dogs and a nice spot for my hammock on sunny days, so it would be good to have someone to take care of the view for me. I think I could also get used to a driver and even my own cook.Mr Goodchild, who is handing in his notice after working for more than 24 years at a metal factory in Hereford, will spend some of his windfall on his family, who are originally from South Wales.He said: I am an only child and my parents have always been there for me. Like all parents, they worry about my mortgage, bills and how long I will have to work for. I\u0027ve told my parents they can stop saving now and spend my inheritance.Mr Goodchild added: I was not brought up to be wealthy but I\u0027m going to have fun learning.He bought his winning ticket from The Co-op on Ledbury Road in Hereford.The winning numbers from the draw on Friday March 15 were 03, 15, 24, 42, 46, and Lucky Stars 09 and 12.Italy rolls out red carpet for Xi Jinping, antagonising allies with plan for China\u0026#39s new Silk RoadHow likely is a delay to Brexit?

On 29\u0026nbspMarch, the UK will simply cease to be a member of the EU if a Withdrawal Agreement or an extension to Article 50 is not agreed.One of the main changes that would immediately result on this day is that the UK will need to apply its own tariff rates on its imports. It will not be bound by the EU\u0027s common external tariffs. It will also not be eligible for zero tariffs on exports to the EU. And, it will lose the benefits of almost all of the EU’s trade agreements, which cover 82 countries. To date, just seven of these trade agreements have been converted into continuity agreements, and none of these are with a major trade partner of the UK.\u0026nbspThe government has announced that, in the case of no deal, it will eliminate tariffs on 87 per cent of imports but introduce tariffs in key sectors including cars, ceramics and key meat products. The Cabinet has been ided over its tariff policy, with Michael Gove reportedly pursuing high tariffs, at least on agriculture, and Phillip Hammond preferring to opt for lower rates. Meanwhile, Liam Fox has floated the idea of unilaterally dropping all tariffs to zero.\u0026nbspFor many products, there is actually very little flexibility. Politics aside, the economic reality is that the maximum tariffs that can be set for any product will be determined by the “bound rates” that the UK already has in place under the WTO.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMembers of the WTO negotiate over the maximum tariffs that governments can apply and these rates must be the same for imports from all countries, with the exception of developing countries and certain trade partners with who there is a comprehensive trade agreement in place. Successive rounds of WTO negotiations have led to low maximum tariff rates on a lot of goods.The average tariff that the UK charges to WTO members is under 3 per cent. But the average rate masks a number of tariff peaks, notably for agricultural products, textiles and apparel, leather products and automobiles, where the government, if they so wish, has a lot more room to deviate from the current EU tariff policy. \u0026nbspThe government faces a trade-off when choosing tariffs: high tariffs will mean higher prices to consumers, no matter whether they buy from the EU or from the rest of the world, as the UK will have to charge the same tariffs to all WTO members under no deal.Low tariffs will expose UK producers to greater import competition and will result in reduced bargaining power in future trade negotiations. The example of food imports illustrates this trade-off. Tariffs\u0026nbspon meat can be as high as 84 per cent, dairy produce up to 74 per cent and grains 63 per cent.At the moment, 71 per cent of UK\u0027s agricultural imports come in duty free from the EU, while the rest face these high tariffs. Jacob Rees-Mogg sees Brexit as a chance to break away from the “protectionist racket” of the EU and extend zero tariffs to all imports so that British consumers can enjoy lots of juicy, perhaps hormone-fed, Australian beef. Michael Gove wants to keep beef tariffs high to protect UK farmers from import competition.\u0026nbspLive: Theresa May caves to Brexiteers with request for short delayThe government’s plan is to place food items that are not produced in the UK (like oranges and sugar) on the zero tariff list and food items, like beef and lamb, that are produced in the UK on the sensitive list with tariffs. This is a sensible approach to account for consumer and producer interests - get rid of unnecessary costs to consumers where possible and try to protect domestic producers from import competition where desirable.While this logic seems sensible for unilateral trade policy actions, it overlooks the fact that tariff peaks mostly remain in sectors where trade partners are reluctant to open up their economies to imports. Take cars for instance. Most developed countries protect their auto industry, arguably because of the value addition, research and development and the high quality of jobs that it provides.Under no deal, the UK will impose a 10 per cent tariff on cars – the same rate currently applied by the EU to external countries - to protect the domestic auto industry. But that\u0027s just not going to be significant enough to help the UK car industry during a time when its exports start to incur tariffs in their biggest export destination - the EU.In fact, the most comprehensive study on the projected impacts of no deal on the UK car industry suggests a 12 per cent reduction in UK car production, because the rise in domestic sales would hardly make up for the loss in sales from increased trade barriers in UK\u0027s export markets.\u0026nbspUnilateral trade policy actions are limited in terms of what they can achieve. That\u0027s the reason trade agreements exist – they enable countries to reduce trade barriers and encourage mutual economic activity by providing reciprocal market access to each other.Government plan to axe no deal tariffs savaged by all and no wonderBrexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as \u0027madness\u0027Tariffs to be scrapped on most imports after no-deal BrexitPlans to scrap import tariffs after no-deal Brexit to be kept secretThe EU-Canada trade deal does exactly that in the auto sector – both sides made concessions to each other by lowering tariffs and reducing costs arising from regulatory ergence between them.\u0026nbspGovernments rarely eliminate all tariffs unilaterally because tariffs are important bargaining chips in trade negotiations to get market access concessions from trade partners in the same or other areas.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspUltimately, while the government\u0027s proposed principle of managing consumer and producer interests appears sound, it begs the same question that many have been wondering since the run-up to the referendum. Is all this tinkering over little margins of adjustment on unilateral trade policy worth the loss of deep market access with the world\u0027s largest trading bloc and the clout that goes with it in third country trade negotiations?The actual performance of the economy since the Brexit referendum suggests \u0027no\u0027. The UK is now one of slowest growing OECD countries. Sterling has depreciated massively and remains low.\u0026nbsp This has already made imports more expensive, especially intermediate inputs, and there has been no export boom. New research shows workers have already borne the brunt of this.As the UK\u0027s place in global value chains has become more precarious, workers have seen slower wage growth and cutbacks in job-related education and training. This does not augur well for future productivity.\u0026nbspMuch time has been spent over tariffs and this has taken away from the bigger question of weak productivity and low real wage growth in the UK. Services, which have no tariffs, are key to this as they employ 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s workforce. The scale of the costs from no deal in services and related activities could be large.The EU is a crucial market for UK services and getting access to third markets in these sectors is even more fraught with concerns over sovereignty and quality standards. Except sectors like finance which have the clout to get special deals, much of the UK economy will have to pay a hefty cost under no deal, which could result in long-term reductions in GDP.Dr Swati Dhingra is a research leader for The UK in a Changing Europe, Associate Professor, Department of Economics and Research Associate, Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.

Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above the growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker – productivity –\u0026nbspis falling.”If a fall in productivity – the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour –\u0026nbspwas to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefiting from earning a wage,” he said.\u0026nbsp“By backing the\u0026nbspgovernment’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

The odds remain small but not insignificant – around one-tenth of 1 per cent.Only slightly wider than the height of the Empire State Building, Bennu is not big enough to destroy Earth but could cause huge destruction.Its size makes it the smallest body to ever be orbited by a spacecraft, Nasa said.Studying Bennu with Osiris-Rex will allow researchers to learn more about the origins of our solar system, the sources of water and organic molecules on Earth, and the hazards and resources in near-Earth space, the space agency said.Nasa\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphost\u0026nbspa media conference at 5.30pm GMT to announce further details about the agency\u0027s mission to return the spacecraft to Earth.We’ll tell you what’s true.

the sky until Friday.Its arrival coincides with two other astronomical phenomena: the spring equinox and the passing of an asteroid close to Earth.The occurrence\u0026nbspof the spring equinox – the

moon For most of the UK, the sun will set shortly after 6pm on Wednesday and rise again shortly after 6am on Thursday, giving 12 hours of darkness to view the supermoon.Viewing conditions for the supermoon in the UK are not ideal, according to the Met Office, with most of the country covered in cloud on Wednesday night.\u0026nbspThe Midlands appear to offer the best chance of viewing the full moon, with only partial cloud covering the sky.The next supermoon\u0026nbspwon\u0027t take place until 9 February 2020, though sky gazers will be happy to know it will be the first of four that year.Other celestial events in the calendar for this year include the Lyrids\u0026nbspmeteor shower on 22 April, the Eta Aquarids meteor shower on 6 May and a total solar eclipse on 2 July – though this final event will only be visible in certain areas of the Southern Hemisphere.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The announcement is a rare a piece of good news for car production in the UK which has seen a host of manufacturers move work abroad.The Japanese carmaker will produce a new Suzuki model\u0026nbspat the site in Burnaston which employs around 2,600 people and produced 129,000 cars last year. The company expects production numbers rise\u0026nbspas it rolls out the new model later this year.\u0026nbspEngines are to be supplied by Toyota’s factory in Deeside, North Wales, using components from Japan, the company said.It comes just weeks after Toyota warned it would be impossible to avoid negative effects of a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.“We cannot avoid the negative impact no matter how much we prepare beforehand if\u0026nbspBritain leaves the EU with no deal,” the firm’s senior managing officer\u0026nbspMasayoshi\u0026nbspShirayanagi\u0026nbspsaid in February.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersOn Wednesday, Toyota’s UK managing director,Marvin Cooke said: “Seeking to produce additional volume for other customers is one example of all the efforts we are making to keep our UK manufacturing operations as competitive as they can be.”“We have consistently said for the medium to longer term, continued free and frictionless trade and common automotive technical standards will be essential to support the international competitiveness of the UK automotive sector.”The UK car industry has made increasingly impassioned pleas to the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit which could prove disastrous for the sector.Facing a host of problems, including a slump in demand for diesel-engined cars, a slowdown in China and the prospect of tariffs and border checks after Brexit, several manufacturers have shifted the production of models overseas.The UK’s biggest carmaker, Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover, has ramped up its presence in Slovakia while Nissan announced it would make a new X-Trail model in Japan instead of Sunderland as the company had previously pledged.Japanese car imports to the EU will see tariffs cut to zero over the next few years while those from the UK will be hit with a 10 per cent tax after Brexit unless a new traded deal is agreed.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But has it made a no-deal exit from the European Union\u0026nbspmore likely?Several Tory Eurosceptics think so, as does Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who is setting up a new Brexit Party.They welcomed the speaker’s edict, hoping that denying May a third vote means the UK could still leave without a deal at 11pm on 29 March.True,\u0026nbspthis currently remains\u0026nbspthe legal default position, as set out in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 – and it can be changed only by new legislation. With time running out,\u0026nbspBercow’s decision does mean\u0026nbspthat May has even less of it at her disposal.However, the Eurosceptics are clutching at a very thin straw. Even if Bercow blocked May’s attempt to hold another vote on her deal by 29 March, that would not prevent her rushing through secondary legislation to delay the exit date. She intends to use a statutory instrument, which would require approval by both the Commons and House of Lords after a 90-minute debate.Created with Sketch.Dogs rallied in Brexit protest  Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of protesters gathered with their dogs for the \u0027Brexit is a Dog\u0027s Dinner\u0027 rally near Parliament in Westminster on Sunday 10 March 2019.

Last week, MPs rejected a no-deal departure by 321-278, and voted 412-202 to extend the two-year Article 50 process. It\u0026nbspwould be odd for the government to ignore these votes.In the unlikely event it tried, backbenchers would take matters into their own hands.May admits country ‘in crisis’ with 10 days to avert no-deal BrexitThe nuclear option would be to collapse May’s government, with Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal exit backing a no-confidence motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn – as some Tories have threatened to do. Then a caretaker administration would have to respect the will of MPs and avoid no deal.Ironically, the Eurosceptics’ best hope of securing a clean break on 29 March now lies with the 27 other EU members, who must unanimously approve an Article 50 extension. If they decided not to do so, and instead\u0026nbspcut the UK loose, the only way the government could avoid no deal\u0026nbspwould be by revoking its decision to leave the EU, which it could do\u0026nbspunilaterally.May has made clear she would never do this, and it is doubtful whether a majority of MPs would support the idea. However, the signs are that EU leaders will agree to a delay at their summit on Thursday and Friday, as they do not want to be blamed for a chaotic no-deal exit.Strangely, Bercow’s ruling was welcomed by pro-EU as well as Eurosceptic MPs. They can’t both be right. MPs who want a Final Say referendum or a Norway-style deal\u0026nbspbelieve the speaker has made a long extension more likely, and are probably right.There is another reason why Eurosceptics could be disappointed – Bercow himself. His explosive intervention suggests he would help MPs find a way to stop a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspif he needed to.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Ms May is expected to be asked to explain how she would use the extension\u0026nbspto ensure parliament approves an exit deal.Writing to Mr Tusk, the prime minister said the government\u0027s policy remains to leave the European Union in an orderly manner on the basis of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration agreed in November.Referring to the need for the UK to elect MEPs in elections this summer if Brexit was delayed beyond June, she said: I do not believe that it would be in either of interests for the UK to hold European Parliament elections.The prime minister said she had planned to hold a third vote on her deal this week but was blocked by John Bercow, the Commons speaker, ruling that she would not be allowed to do so unless the agreement had changed substantially.Announcing her decision in the Commons at the start of Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Ms May told MPs: The government intends to bring forward proposals for a third meaningful vote.If that vote is passed, the extension will give the House time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. If not, the House will have to decide how to proceed.But as prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHer decision was criticised by MPs.Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, wrote on Twitter: Truly shocking. This is a prime minister in the worst state of denial, refusing to listen to anyone, just still doing the same thing again and again, no plan B, heading stubbornly towards the cliff edge.Some Tory Brexiteers, meanwhile, said Ms May was wrong to seek any extension at all.EU commission opposes Theresa May request for June Brexit delayLive: Theresa May caves to Brexiteers with request for short delayMay keeps her job, but is humiliated by the Brexiteers in her partyTheresa May to request \u0027short\u0027 Brexit extension in letter to EUPeter Bone told her: If you continue to apply for an extension to Article 50 you will be betraying the British people.

We need something new because if it’s an extension to remain in the same deadlock, how do we get out of this? The British have to come with an initiative that is clear and credible and supported by a majority,” the French minister told reporters on her way into a meeting of ministers in Brussels.Arriving at the same\u0026nbspmeeting, Mr Roth added: “We’re really exhausted by these negotiations and\u0026nbspI expect clear and\u0026nbspprecise proposals of UK government\u0026nbspwhy an extension is necessary. It’s not just a game. It’s an extremely serious situation not just for people in UK but also for the people in EU.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?“For my government it’s the key priority to prevent a no-deal Brexit. I don’t have any appetite for substanceless, very abstract discussions and negotiations on Brexit. Please deliver, dear friends in London, please deliver. The clock is ticking.”Ms May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet with the 27 other EU leaders, after parliament approved an extension to Article 50 – which would delay Brexit past 29 March. Under EU treaties, such\u0026nbspan extension must be approved unanimously by all 27 other member states – meaning each one has an effective power of veto.Speaking on Tuesday after meeting EU27 ministers, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said leaders would have to assess what is in the best interests of the bloc before making a decision.“I am here to ask a very legitimate question on behalf of the European authorities –\u0026nbspwhich is why do you want an extension? What for? What’s the objective of an extension? What use would it be? An extension has to be useful,” he said.“Does an extension increase the chances of ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?”Barnier speaking in Brussels after the meeting (EbS)He added: “What would be the purpose and outcome? And how can we ensure that, at the end of a possible extension, we are not back in the same situation as today?”Mr Barnier warned that “extending uncertainty without a clear plan” would have political and economic costs for the EU, and that a longer extension needed to be linked to something – such as a new political process in the UK to find a solution to the deadlock.Also speaking after the meeting, Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said there was “a lot of concern amongst EU member states and partners about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50”.“An extension brings risks with it, obviously through a European election cycle and the establishment of a new commission, and the EU is dealing with a lot of things at the moment,\u0026nbspso the disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months, or another whatever period of time, is something that I think people will need convincing on,” he said.Mr Coveney added that “there will need to be a very persuasive plan to go with that, to explain why that’s needed, and how they will use the time to conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process”.He warned that an extension would not necessarily be accepted: “I think people would be very foolish to assume that this is just some kind of political game and that an extension will automatically be facilitated. I do think EU leaders will be demanding.“The EU does not want to grant an extension on request for the UK that brings us back to the same point that we are at today, in three months, six months, nine months’ time, having wasted a lot more time”.The comments by the French, German\u0026nbspand Irish ministers are the latest expression of frustration from EU leaders at Britain’s approach to talks, which is seen in Brussels and elsewhere on the continent as erratic, poorly planned and ided.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Dogs rallied in Brexit protest  Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of protesters gathered with their dogs for the \u0027Brexit is a Dog\u0027s Dinner\u0027 rally near Parliament in Westminster on Sunday 10 March 2019.

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

She said she\u0026nbspwas “not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30 June”.Theresa May to request ‘short’ Brexit extension in letter to EUThe decision of whether to extend and by how long is not\u0026nbspup to Brussels – but the 27 other EU member states, who must unanimously approve any delay. Though there are differing\u0026nbspviews in EU capitals about a delay, throughout Brexit talks member states have however so far stuck close to the European Commission’s line.If the Commission’s advice is followed by leaders on Thursday, Theresa May will have to choose between a very short extension, or a longer one. The latter is likely to be unpalatable to her party and Cabinet, while the former may not be long enough to achieve anything in – depending on what her plan is.The reason for the concerns laid out in the document, which was reviewed by the Commission at its weekly meeting on Wednesday, is because of the logistical effect such a\u0026nbspmiddling-length extension could have on the EU.EU member states are due to get extra MEPs in the coming European Parliament elections because of Britain’s departure – with the UK’s old seats split up between the other countries.\u0026nbspAs a result, the EU says it would\u0026nbspneed to know by late\u0026nbspApril so that seats could be allocated properly ahead of the elections.The diplomatic note also says that any long extension should see Britain,\u0026nbsp”in a spirit of loyal cooperation”, commit to “constructive abstention” on key issues, such as the budget and selection of Commissioners.Created with Sketch.

What for? What’s the objective of an extension? What use would it be? An extension has to be useful.”\u0026nbspMr Barnier warned that “extending uncertainty without a clear plan” would have political and economic costs for the EU, and that a longer extension needed to be linked to something – such as a new political process in the UK to find a solution to the deadlock.EU leaders also issued similar warnings, with\u0026nbspMichael Roth, Germany’s Europe minister, telling reporters in Brussels that\u0026nbspEU member states were “really exhausted” by the UK’s approach to talks, and that the situation was “not just a game”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Will May remove the whip?The PM says all MPs need to watch the type of language they use.Catherine West, another Labour MP, asks the PM to support young people marching for a Final Say referendum at the weekend - organised by The Independent and the People\u0027s Vote.Labour\u0027s Lloyd Russell-Moyle asks May to condemn Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who said it was for parents to decide if their children were \u0027exposed\u0027 to LGBTQ education in schools.\u0026nbspMay says she will write to him with the guidance but the government takes this very seriously.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve done a story on the row:Brexiteer Peter Bone says May has committed to leaving on March 29 more than 100 times and she will be betraying the people if she delays Brexit.He tells her \u0027history will judge you\u0027.May says she wants the deal to be passed and the delay won\u0027t go beyond June 30.SNP\u0027s Ian Blackford says it is \u0027downright reckless\u0027 to pursue a short extension - quoting David Lidington, her de facto deputy.May says she has already answered this question to Jeremy Corbyn. MPs did not vote for her deal and must face the consequences.Blackford says she is acting in her own self interest. If Westminster fails, Scotland will act, he says.The PM says it is a huge responsibility to be PM but the UK voted to leave the EU.Corbyn attacks the\u0026nbspPM for running down the clock, applying bullying and blackmail to get MPs\u0026nbspto back her deal. He says the British people are getting frustrated. He asks if she will she give the British people the chance to reject the deal and change the government.The PM says her deal is the best one - and it keeps the UK safe.May and Corbyn are really clashing now. May says the Commons has \u0027indulged itself on Europe for too long\u0027 - prompting huge roars from the MPs.John Bercow has to intervene to calm the House. She continues, saying the British people deserve better than what MPs have been giving them.Corbyn hits back at her comments, saying it is disrespectful to\u0026nbspsuggest it\u0027s\u0026nbspan indulgence to be diligent on considering Brexit.The PM says the people voted to deliver Brexit and accuses him of disrespecting democracy by supporting a second referendum.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadThe EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u0026nbspwarned Brussels would want\u0026nbspa good reason to grant a long delay to\u0026nbspBrexit.In an apparent reference to options like a second referendum, general election or cross-party consensus, he said a lengthy extension needs to be linked to something new ... a new event or a new political process.The request for an extension will dismay hardline Leavers still hoping for a no-deal clean\u0026nbspBrexit next Friday, but she has apparently bowed to Eurosceptic MPs\u0026nbspby refusing to request a longer extension - thereby reducing the time available to avoid the UK crashing out without a deal.In a fractious cabinet discussion of the planned letter on Tuesday, Leave-backing Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom is understood to have said: This used to be the Cabinet that would deliver\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand now, from what I\u0027m hearing, it\u0027s not.US president Donald Trump\u0027s son said Ms May should honour her promise to take Britain out of the EU next Friday.In an article in the Daily , Donald Trump Jr accused Mrs May of ignoring his father\u0027s advice and claimed that elites control London from Brussels and democracy in the UK is all but dead.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above the growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker – productivity –\u0026nbspis falling.”If a fall in productivity – the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour –\u0026nbspwas to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefiting from earning a wage,” he said.\u0026nbsp“By backing the\u0026nbspgovernment’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall.

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice president with a reputation for veering off script?In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party on Saturday, Mr Biden boasted he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.”The only problem is Mr Biden has not announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.Although Mr Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe – a case of accidentally telling the truth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

But the biggest support is what I got from my family.” She said. Fiona pumped at 10 o’clock in the morning and at 3 o’clock in the afternoon in the office storage room. She would then immediately send the breast milk to her father waiting downstairs. A few minutes later, her baby would enjoy her still warm milk.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We needed the permission of the police to do that but you know, but quite frankly I didn’t care and neither did M. We just wanted to get on with it.Mr Peribanez adds: Patrick was a young kid at the time. We spent hours doing stake outs, surveillance. He was a quick learner.Mr Malinka confirmed he was followed, telling the documentary: My first experience of private surveillance was when I saw some cars in my rear view mirrors. I made a list of the number plates.Patrick says: We were trying to find out where he was going because it looked like he was trying to get somewhere in a rush.He has no regret for his actions, saying: I didn’t feel sorry for anybody. The little girl who had been abducted - that is the person I felt sorry for. Nobody .Mr Peribanez said at one point his boss told me to call him and offer him money to talk about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Confirming the approach was made, Mr Malinka reveals: In this sort of situation there are two types of people - one with power and one without. I didn’t have the power or the money.Mr Peribanez continues: I started with ,and I went to half a million, something like that. Malinka said don’t offer me money because I don’t know anything and I can’t give you anything.While Mr Malinka was wrongly dragged into the botched police inquiry someone firebombed his car when it was parked by his flat in Luz, and the Portuguese word FALA, which means talk, was sprayed on the pavement.There is no suggestion in the documentary M had anything to do with that crime but Mr Malinka recalls the incident, saying: This is the only time when it broke me, really hurt me. One missed phone call pretty much ruined ten years of my le.Mr Peribanez also admits: We put some trackers on Murat’s car and they found them. Sometimes you have to do things that are on the verge, on the border, no. Private investigations in Portugal are illegal. As a private investigator you are not to follow the book of rules.It gives you more freedom to investigate than being a cop.After extensive surveillance, the investigators found nothing to link Mr Murat or Mr Malinka to Maddie’s disappearance and Mr Peribanez tells the programme: They had nothing to do with it.Heart doctor Gerry, , and former GP Kate, , of Rothley, Leics refused to take part in the Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann”.The pair believe it could hamper the nearly  year search to find their daughter, as well as fuel conspiracy theories regarding her disappearance.\" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-top.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" \" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-middle.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" \" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MADDIE-GRAPHIC-bottom.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which would stop us from striking trade deals around the world.But other EU leaders have blasted Labour for refusing to sign up to the PMs deal.Around  ERG members are still pushing for more changes to the deal, which the EU has refused to agree to.Earlier this week the PMs plans to force through another vote on her deal were damaged by Remainer Speaker Bercow who insisted she cant bring back the same deal to the Commons yet again.He demanded she change it substantially or he wont let MPs debate it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477044231-e1553082060920.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn labour party brexit second referendum","story":"The Shadow Cabinet was presented with damning research which shows the ongoing Brexit chaos has damaged the partys local election chances -

But she WONaposT be asking for a long extension...  Fresh news this morning from a Downing Street source, who tells us: The PM won’t be asking for a long extension. There is a case for giving Parliament a bit more time to agree a way forward, but the people of this country have been waiting nearly three years now. They are fed up with Parliament’s failure to take a decision and the PM shares their frustration. Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News sheaposll be asking for a short delay to get the deal agreed and this should be as short an extension as possible. ... Because sheaposs backed down in a nuclear Tory row  The reason Downing Street officials are briefing journalists like this is because of an enormous Tory row. The point of threatening a massive delay was it would frighten Brexiteers into finally backing the Brexit deal. Last week she said menacingly: The House must understand and accept thatit is not willing to support a deal in the coming days... there will need to be a much longer extension. But all that fight seems to be gone after a brutal, -minute session of the Cabinet over Brexit yesterday. Leave-backing ministers lined up to say they would not accept a long delay and some purportedly threatened to resign. One, Andrea Leadsom, told the stormy meeting yesterday: This used to be the Cabinet that would deliver Brexit - and now from what Iaposm hearing, itaposs not.     The problem is,Theresa May is backing down it doesnapost actually solve this issue. Instead it means sheaposs taken away any incentive for Brexiteers to back her deal in the coming weeks. And sheaposs made it more likely that delaying Brexit wonapost actually achieve anything because it wonapost give enough time to draw up a new plan.That, in turn, all seems to make No Deal Brexit more likely.... No Deal plans will kick in from Monday  Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay has reportedly written to Cabinet announcing Operation Yellowhammer - worst case planning for no deal - will be implemented on Monday. In event a Brexit extension is not agreed over the weekend Op Yellowhammer command and control will be aposenacted fullyapos, thereports. Barclay says that ministers must retain apospublic no deal narrativeapos regardless of whether extension is secured He says departments should continue to prepare for no-deal on March  while also readying themselves for changing plans in event of extension. If an extension is confirmed... it will mean maintaining no deal scenario as operational focus, he reportedly writes. Cabinet will subsequently need to decide whether to futher intensy or scale back efforts, depending onof extension.  An ad for a high-cost loan which used uncertainty around Brexit to encourage consumers to stockpile food has been banned for being socially irresponsible. A January  email from Cash On Go, trading as Peachy, a financial services company specialising in short-term loans, stated: No one really knows whataposs going on with this whole Brexit malarkey... and some say it could affect the amount of food available... We do not want to believe that Brexit will impact the amount of food available but itaposs still a good idea to have a little stockpile ready. That way youaposre always prepared for the worst.

It also shows just how stupid the rest of us have become.For we have reached the point where the least-impressive member of a family renowned for lies, tax avoidance, birtherism, bungs to strippers and other poor choices is actually invited by a national newspaper to give us the benefit of his thoughts on the biggest constitutional crisis of our letimes.Itaposs like chopping your leg off then asking a chicken to call you an ambulance. Cluck, replies the Daily , the once-great newspaper which exposed the MPsapos expenses scandal and whose crossword was used to recruit code-breakers for Bletchley Park. A thousand days after the referendum, and with little over a week to go before the promised March  deadline, Britain seems to be infected with Mad Cow Disease - stumbling, mumbling, and s***ting itself.But everyone wailing about listening to the will of the people, or having a second vote, has forgotten something important. Weaposve had a second vote already, and we told Theresa May to pack it in.  A week after becoming Prime Minister in July , she said she wouldnapost trigger the Article  process for leaving the EU until there was a plan in place. Three months later, she said she would.Three months after THAT, the Supreme Court told her she couldnapost, and before another  months were up Parliament told her to go ahead. She appointed unqualied and incapable Brexit windbags to her Cabinet. She set out impossible red lines. She listened to the most extreme backbenchers and ignored the moderates. Perhaps worst of all, she refused to enact the Vote Leave manesto promise of a considered, four-year negotiation conducted by cross-party politicians, lawyers and experts from business.Instead, she sent David Davis. The only man capable of making a chicken look gted. In March  she did what she said she wouldnapost, triggered Article , and was applauded by the Right wing media while the experts said this was a terrible idea.A month later, she called a general election in order to improve her support, and was handed her arse on a plate by the British electorate.The aposwill of the peopleapos was that she govern with a minority government that would force her to seek consensus. We refused to back the hard, rudderless, plan-free Brexit we could already see was being led by the factory rejects, and told her to wind her neck in a bit.That general election was the first time the public had a chance to review Brexit its instruction had a greater mandate and majority than the earlier referendum. The Prime Minister ignored us. She rejected cross-party consensus in favour of angry - and expensive - screaming by the DUP. A month later she sent Davis to Brussels, and he forgot his notes. He went on to fail so badly at he job he was given that the civil servant sat next to him had to do all the talking, and Davis later resigned in disgust that the subsequent deal had been written by him, too.Before the year was up her government became the first in history to be in contempt of Parliament. Her deal then suffered the biggest defeat of all time, the second version fared little better, and the Commons whacked her  to  for her negotiating strategy. A chicken, given that sort of telling off, carries blithely on. And so did Theresa. Her approval rating has dropped to -. Her partyaposs pre-referendum isions over Europe, and which claimed the scalps of three Prime Ministers before her, seem like a choir singing in perfect harmony compared to the sound of MPs now feasting on one anotheraposs intestines. Her current plan is to delay Brexit for not long enough , meaning that Parliament cannot debate it again, and the EU canapost hold its elections andto the office in time. Leavers are angrier. Remainers are smugger. The vast majority of people who lie somewhere between those two posts despair of our politics, our politicians, and their intellectual ability.The EU which was once so sad to see us go is holding our coat and waiting for the cab. The economy which was a global powerhouse and our guarantee of a good deal is stuttering - business canapost plan, and billionaires wonapost stay. All those parts of our nation which rely on a clean and calm Brexit - the NHS, agriculture, care homes, road haulage, clean drinking water, medicine, the Cityaposs million jobs and £trillion of turnover - are either suffering already or do not know theyaposll be safe after Friday week.It is a Prime Ministeraposs job to unite, lead, plan, adapt. It is Theresaaposs job to run the country, and all she has done is run it into the ground in total opposition of the first Brexit vote, the general election result, the decisions of Parliament and the needs of both her party and her nation. She has ignored, reinterpreted, and refused the will of the people. We are now citizens of nowhere-worth-mentioning, and sheaposs stuck in a no-manaposs land where she cannot be sacked, cannot be forced to resign, and her party is so self-defeating they will give her their confidence to continue this extended political suicide which will make the Tories unelectable for a generation. If the will of the people from  is to be respected at all costs, it needs that cross-party negotiation by experts, and not fools. If the democratic expression of  is to be respected, Brexit must be soft and careful. Andlogic is to be respected, the country needs to accept the reasons for Brexit have been steadily killed off.There is no problem with Parliament making its own laws. There is no issue with the , EU regulations weaposve already readopted. And we cannot take control of our borders when our only land border with the EU has to remain uncontrolled, on pain of pain.We voted for Brexit. When we saw it, we voted for a soft Brexit. Now weaposve seen that, and Parliament cannot decide what to do with it, another vote is inevitable - we either vote for a tin-eared, tone-deaf, incompetent leader who has destroyed everything she touched, or we let someone  have a go.Jeremy Corbyn may be better, or he may be worse.

Pictures of the incident provoked outrage after they circulated on social media on Monday  - with many deeming the junior manageraposs actions as racist. The hotel has now issued an apology following the incident and has strongly denied accusations of racism. It said the employeeaposs actions were deeply unacceptable and say he is now undergoing disciplinary procedures. Peter Banks, the hotelaposs managing director, said in a statement: We sincerely apologise for any offence caused. We recognise what happened is not acceptable behaviour and the junior member of staff concerned was immediately asked to remove the make-up by a senior member of staff on the night of the event. This was a very ill judged and immature action by a -year-old, who now realises the consequences of his behaviour and regrets the hurt it has caused. He is now undergoing disciplinary procedures.  Rudding Park in no way condones racism and it is not at all acceptable to the company. We employ  dferent nationalities and do not discriminate on racial grounds. It is of the utmost importance to us that everyone is treated equally and with respect. We have already scheduled a complete racial bias training programme for all our staff to attend to ensure something like this does not happen again.

Detective Constable Rebecca Bryant, , knew Lauren Jones as her sonaposs girlfriend and sent messages to the juror telling her to keep quiet about the connection. Bryant, a family liaison officer to victim Lynford Brewsteraposs family, even offered Miss Jones lts to the court One text from the detective read: Don’t tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I’ve told u about it although u know I haven’t xxx. Her lies cost the taxpayer at least £, - as a retrial into the killers was ordered by the Court of Appeal.    Bryant sat with murder victimaposs family in the courtroom as Miss Jones was just yards away on the jury bench. Dwayne Edgar, , Jake Whelan, , and Robert Lainsbury, , were convicted in December  of murder in the cold-blooded killing - and sentenced to le in prison. But all three had their convictions quashed after the relationship between the detective and juror was later discovered. A Court of Appeal judgement said: Several weeks after the trial an appellant’s solicitor received information that a police officer providing family liaison, Detective Constable Bryant, who had attended court during the trial to provide support to the deceased’s family, had a close relationship with a member of the jury. That officer’s son was in a long-term relationship with the juror.    There was recovered from the officer’s phone a series of texts which the pair had exchanged at that time which are highly material in this appeal. “It is clear that the officer initially lied about having any relationship with Ms Jones, although she subsequently admitted contacts with her in interview.” The Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and Edgar, Whelan and Lainsbury were ordered to have a retrial. The texts from Bryant were uncovered after an investigation was launched by the CPS. The messages from the South Wales Police detective read: The Murder trial is put back til st. Not that that matters cos they’ll hold u til thenthey need to. “Remember what I sed though, as long as you don’t know any of the witnesses that’s fine.... I won’t be there hardly and I’m not a witness anyway so that ok u don’t need to worry bout that.    “Don’t tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I’ve told u about it although u know I haven’t xxx.” One message also offered Miss Jones a lt to court: If ur on the murder ul be finished same time as me most days u can have a lt to mine afterwardsu wanted x.” Jones replied, saying: “Fab thanks! The bus is a nightmare x.” The probe found Miss Jones also worked with victim Mr Brewsteraposs sister. The judgement said: She said nothing about her connection to the sister of the deceased. At one point she did say something to the effect that she was a teacher at the school but went no further than that. She appears to have followed the advice given in the first text mentioned.” The police officer also failed to say anything to anybody although she was aware that the juror was sitting on the murder trial.”  The three were convicted for a second time after a seven-week trial at Bristol Crown Court which ended this week.

Border Force officers at Manchester Airport also noticed Ali Zgaeer, , had only one empty bottle to feed the baby boy with. A court has heard how Zgaeer had been paid €,by a family friend to bring the boy from his mother in Greece to his father in Manchester. The childaposs mother was struggling financially so she sought to reunite him with his father, who had been granted asylum in the UK, the Manchester Evening News reported.   Minshull Street Crown Court heard the babyaposs father Bader Kanash, , had been living in the Whalley area of Manchester and had no idea about the plan to bring his son to him. Zgaeer travelled from his home in Belgium to pick up Kanashaposs child in Greece, before boarding a flight from Athens to Manchester, arriving on November  last year. After arriving in Manchester, Zgaeer produced his passport and another passport in the name of a girl, belonging to his own daughter. The court heard it was thought there was some resemblance between the girl and the baby. When border force officers discovered the passport was , Zgaeer was detained. After time passed while investigations continued, it became clear that the babyaposs nappy needed to be changed. But when Zgaeer tried to change it, the court heard it was aposimmediately obviousapos he had aposno idea how to do soapos. Officers also noticed he only had one empty milk bottle to feed the baby with. Questioning continued, and Zgaeer was asked why he was trying to use a girlaposs passport for a boy. At first he claimed that the authorities issuing the passport must have made a mistake, but officers realised his explanations were  and he confessed shortly after.    Zgaeer said: Iaposm sorry, I wonapost do it again. I will never do it again, I have children. I knew I had done something wrong. He said that the money was to pay for his travel to Manchester and back, and that when he got to Manchester he would contact Kanash so he could hand over the child. After being informed his son had arrived in the UK, Kanash went to the airport and was arrested there. A Kuwaiti national, Kanash originally came to the UK in  and claimed asylum. He attended the birth of his son in Greece last year, but ed to Manchester after. Anam Khan, defending Zgaeer, said that the defendant agreed to take the child on the flight because he aposfelt sorryapos for the family. Having fled from the war in Iraq in  and moving to Belgium, Zgaeer was motivated by humanitarian reasons to help them, Ms Khan said. She described Zgaeer, a father-of-five, as a aposhard working family manapos who worked as a carpenter back home to provide for his loved ones.   The court heard that Kanash was in an aposentirely dferent positionapos to Zgaeer, because Kanash was not aware of the plot until it was already in motion. It is a unique and completely isolated offence for him, his barrister Elizabeth Evans said. Kanash is now the primary carer for his son who is living at home with him, the court heard. Sentencing, Judge Tina Landale told Zgaeer: You knew you were bringing a baby into the UK in breach of immigration rules. Because of the amount of time that you had been detained, it was necessary to change the baby’s nappy. It became immediately obvious you had no idea how to do so, and the conspiracy was detected. The judge continued: You [Zgaeer] were to gain financially from your part in this conspiracy. You [Kanash] did not know about his operation until very late, when the events had already begun. You were faced with a dficult decision as to what to do when you found out your baby was being brought into the UK. You should have told the police, but you didnapost. Zgaeer, of Harrow, Middlesex, and Kanash, of Whalley Range, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration law. Zgaeer was jailed for  months, while Kanash received a  month community order and must carry out  hours of unpaid work.

Itaposs been  years since Joan Lawrenceaposs daughter Claudia vanished, and she says her friendship with Kate McCann, , has helped her through her darkest days. Joan, , told Bella magazine: Over the years, I began to get in touch with the mums of other missing children. I exchanged letters with Kate McCann and met up with Ben Needhamaposs mum Kerry. We drew strength from one another, offering words of encouragement and affection on particularly dark days - of which, there are many.    Itaposs the first time Joan, from York, has opened up about her friendship with Kate, whose daughter Madeleine , from Rothley, Leicestershire, was just three-years-old when she vanished on a family holiday in Portugal in May . Both cases remain unsolved, and Claudiaaposs disappearance became a murder inquiry. Claudia, a chef at York University, was last seen walking to her home in the Heworth area of York on March , , and she phoned her parents that night. But the -year-old failed to arrive for her am sht the following day.    It is thought she may have been abducted on her two-mile walk to work. Joan told the Mirror she fears she will die before she finds out what happened to her daughter. She has accused the police of a catalogue of errors and demanded an apology. She said: “I was promised everything was being done to find Claudia, instead one catastrophic mistake was made after another.    “The ultimate consequences are that even now I am woken in the dead of night, haunted by images of what could have happened to her. “Because I don’t have answers, I wake up, frozen with terror. Was Claudia frightened, is she still frightened  “I’m so scared that I will go to my grave and not have the answers I so desperately need.” The errors, she said, included police releasing a photo of Claudia with blonde hair even though she was a brunette at the time. Joan said her daughteraposs reputation was damaged as police probed her love le and relationships with married men.  Earlier in the investigation, she said, the police allowed the public to see Claudia as some sort of marriage breaker and that her relationship with married men led to her disappearance. She added: It left me utterly broken. Det Supt Dai Malyn, who oversees a new team reviewing the case, said: “This is the purpose of investigative reviews, when a team of fresh eyes and relevant experience are brought in. “We updated the family at every opportunity... as we still do. We continue to investigate information provided about Claudia’s disappearance and suspected murder.”  Last week, Claudiaaposs dad Peter Lawrence, , told the Mirror it is getting “more dficult” to believe she is alive after nearly  years without her. He added: “It just keeps going on and on, of course, because of not knowing what happened and it is the not knowing which has always been the worst part about it. “I’ve always said that and, until such time as we know what happened, that will just go on unfortunately.” Madeleineaposs disappearance is documented in a new Netflix programme called The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, which takes a new look at the case and theories about what happened to her.

Jade Madden, , and her -year-old partner Megan Madden both got caught up in a fight with two other women over alleged homophobic comments made towards them near Manchesteraposs gay village. During the assault, Jade who claimed she had been branded an ugly dyke, grabbed Adele Riley by the hair before tee-total Megan, who works a bouncer delivered repeated strikes to the victimaposs face and neck with a pen kne. Mother-of-two Miss Riley, , who had an earlier been ejected from a bar suffered two superficial injuries and three wounds to her head which are feared to have left her scarred for le.    In a statement the victim said in the months after the attack on January ,  she was unable to walk home from work on her own and it had stopped her from going out in Manchester city centre. At Manchester Crown Court Megan, of Old Trafford was jailed for five years and ten months after she admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and having a bladed article. Jade from Fallowfield who is due to give birth in two months sobbed as shew walked free with six weeks jail suspended for a year after admitting using threatening behaviour.    The incident occurred after the couple encountered Miss Riley on Portland Street in the city centre whilst seeing in . The victim had been in Bar Rogue but was thrown out after a confrontation with Shannon Smith a friend of the Maddens. Alexandra Sutton prosecuting said: The confrontation on the street continued with Smith arguing with Miss Rileyaposs cousin who then punched Miss Smith. Miss Riley intervened but she was clearly agitated and was shouting and gesticulating. Whatever was said clearly angered the Maddens and they were immediately involved in a scuffle grappling with one another.  Jade can be seen to go over to Miss Riley and can be seen to pull Miss Rileyaposs hair to the pavement. Megan can be seen delivering repeated strikes to the face and neck of Miss Riley as she was being held by Jade. The evidence is Megan pulled out a kne, possibly a pen kne and there were two bursts of stabbing. Shannon Smith was also seen delivering two blows to Miss Riley. Megan then strikes a further blow to Miss Madden and then puts a implement into her pocket. The three then got into a taxi to flee the scene.The court heard the couple were traced via Facebook . In mitigation for Megan, defence lawyer Dan Gaskell said: She is clearly an intelligent young woman who has acted entirely out of character this particular night - a serious one off that is going to have signicant consequences for her and her partner and their child. She became involved because her partner was involved in a fight with another woman. Her subsequent actions were entirely despicable and she has had many months to reflect upon that. For Jade, defence lawyer Philip Mahoney said: The victim can be seen shouting and gesticulating towards Jade Madden calling her an aposugly dyke.apos This is a young lady that has never been in trouble before she is pregnant due to give birth in a month or so she is partner of Megan Madden and the hope had been that they would coparent.  Sentencing Judge Alan Conrad QC said: This was serious group violence at night, in public, on a crowded street. The incident was taken to an altogether and more serious level by Megan Madden using that kne to stab the victim repeatedly to the head, face and neck causing wounds of which she is actively conscious of and causing her to be fearful of going out in public. I accept that there was some provocation but you all continued to be involved none the less. Megan Madden it is disturbing that you a person of good character were carrying a blade in public and that when a violent situation occurred you drew that kne and used it to wound in a dangerous manner. The carrying of a knives are matters of great concern. You face for this a signicant custodial sentence. A stab wound to the neck can quite easily result in a fatal injury and you could have been spending at least  years in prison. Former trainee nursery nurse Shannon Smith, , of Moss Side, Manchester admitted a public order offence and was ordered ti complete  hours unpaid work as part of a two year community order.

The heir to the throne, who turned  last November, took a break from his hectic schedule on the Caribbean island to cool off in crystal clear blue sea.  Former military man Charles is renowned for being very active, having served in both the navy and air force and trained as a jet pilot maintaining an incredible level of fitness.  He is also an avid polo player, goes on regular hikes, and has a regular fitness regimen.   The Prince has been known to do push-ups and crunches before bed and was even recorded asking the National Welsh Rugby team for training advice, to help him be even more fit.    Camilla, who is , also looked incredibly fit in an aqua-blue one-piece swimsuit with onlookers saying the royal couple “looked very happy together”.  The royal couple are undertaking more than  engagements, covering six countries and one overseas territory including a historic trip to Cuba over the next  days at the behest of the Foreign Office.  The highlight of their trip is a four-day tour of Cuba beginning on March  - the first by members of the monarchy.  One onlooker at the public beach in Barbados said: “Charles looked absolutely incredible. He has a physique of a very fit man less than half his age.    “He is testament to living a healthy and actively lestyle.” The images have drawn comparisons with infamous pictures of Charles from  when Jane Priest, a glamorous Perth model became a global sensation after famously ambushing him in the surf at Cottesloe Beach in front of the world’s media.

The heir maintains a strict diet, revealed in an interview for his th birthday, which revealed his eating habits are more like an eccentric retired Colonel’s than King Henry VIII’s.  It all starts with breakfast when Charles sits down to an egg boiled for exactly four minutes.  With that, he has a cup of Darjeeling tea with milk and honey.   The Prince always skips lunch but almost always has some form of game for his supper.  Indicating a borderline obsession with the small game birds, Charles has also claimed to have invented a version of moussaka using grouse - calling it “groussaka”.

We will also be looking at the impact that kne crime has on iniduals, their families and communities and how knives are getting into the hands of under  year olds. The unlawful use or possession of a kne is unacceptable and will not be tolerated in Hertfordshire and we will continue to target those we know are carrying knives. Other forces had similar results. Police in the seaside town of Lowestoft, Suffolk, counted  knives left in a bin at Lowestoft Police Station while officers in Derbyshire recovered dozens of ornate knives from their red bins.  Two samurai swords were among danger weapons left at Radford Road Police Station in Hyson Green, Notts, while in west Berkshire, sickening images show knives - including a meat cleaver - piled up after being tipped out of amnesty bins. Even leafy Chichester, West Sussex, was not free from the scourge, with  knives, including several butterfly blades, handed in. An Essex Police officer Tweeted a picture after he emptied a bin in Braintree, using the hashtags #onlycowardscarry and #noknivesinessex Meanwhile South Wales Policeaposs Cardf ision lined their Operation Sceptre haul up, with chilling images showing the  knives handed in.  They Tweeted: Successful kne amnesty in Ely today. ElyNPT have received over  knives. These will be destroyed. And officers in Mildenhall, Suffolk, said the number of knives handed in during their Operation Sceptre week was shocking. A picture even shows some darts handed in alongside blades in their bins. Mildenhall Police Tweeted: Pleasing or shocking result....as the Mildenhall kne amnesty bin reveals  knives surrendered during #opsceptre awareness week . All will be destroyed.  And officers in Humberside - where  knives were handed in - Tweeted a shocking picture showing their bins full of ornamental swords. Hullaposs Inspector Matthew Wilson was present when the bins were unlocked and the contents revealed. He said: There are some very serious weapons here that will now be destroyed and will never get into the hands of anyone who intends to do harm. There is a mixed bag of weapons in the bins.  Some are souvenir swords, which although are not the usual lethal weaponthe owners want to get rid of them then I am happy theyaposve handed them in rather than them getting into the hands of anyone  who could use them to commit crime. Some bins got a lot more knives handed in than others with the main areas being Hull and Grimsby. I want to thank everyone who took the time to come to hand in these weapons. Kne crime has surged recently with many forces seeing huge leaps in the number of offences involving blades. Kent has seen the biggest rise since  with a jump of % while, perhaps surprisingly, London only saw an % increase. Across  counties in England and Wales outside London, kne related offences have risen by . per cent, according to recent figures. There have been  kne murders across the UK from January  to March , while last year there were  homicides in London alone.

Hannah Tittensor, , from Belfast, says she first became addicted to having a tan after ing from a holiday to turkey in . The beauty therapist loved the transformation from her paler skin to a dark tan so much, she decided to start having sunbeds and regular top-up injections. The aposunder-the-counterapos jabs include a substance called Melanotan, which users take to go darker more quickly under sunlight or sun beds. And while Hannah admits she is at the “extreme end’, she says she is part of a growing trend in tanning in Belfast, with many using the illegal drug.    Despite side effects that include feeling sick, her boyfriend Ben Dunlop, , also uses the injections. “Everyone is doing it,” said Hannah. “It’s become a trend in the city.” “I use the sun bed for about fteen minutes, three times a week. “Ben and I do the injections for about one week each month, where you have an injection before you go on the sun bed each time. “I just use the injections to top me up for that week, and then I stay really tanned all month. “I absolutely love the colour I go and much prefer this than spray or fake tan that’s smelly and makes you feel dirty. And it gets all over your clothes and bed.”Like many, Hannah regularly posts photos of herself on social media and has been using Instagram since , before she became hooked on tanning.   But when she uploaded the first photo of herself on the  holiday in Turkey - when she revealed her new ultra-dark skin for the first time - she started to get hate messages and online abuse. “I had an amazing tan but I felt like dying,” she said. “People told me I looked like an alien, that I looked ugly,” she said. “Some people accused me of trying to look like a black woman. I’m not trying to do that at all, I just like the way my skin looks healthy and glowing with a tan. “Some girls can’t live without getting their nails or hair done and for me its tanning. “I’m always playing around with my look . I’ve been a skater girl, sometimes had more of a surfer hippy look, and now I like to look like this.” In January , when Hannah combined her new skin colour with box braids - a type of hair braiding more commonly worn by African and African-American people - she received a fresh waves of attacks. “People were commenting on my photos accusing me of cultural appropriation and even saying that I was racist, just because of how I looked,” she said.    “I’m not racist at all. I’m just a white girl who likes to be overly-tanned. “It seems like I am the worst person in the world just for tanning sometimes. It seems to offend people sometimes and I’m not trying to. It seems pretty harmless to me. “Every girl I see on instagram is tanned. I know I’m at the extreme end but I like the way I look. I feel like me.” Hannah says she first found out about tanning injections when her brother Jack tried them in . “He came in one day and was suddenly really tanned,” she said. “We asked how he did it and he said it was Melanotan.” Trainee barber Ben has been using sun beds since he was  and has now been taking tanning injections for three to four years. He keeps fit with bodybuilding and regularly goes with Hannah to the local gym, where the couple like keep in shape.    Melanotan is widely promoted on bodybuilding websites and forums, aimed at bodybuilders who want to enhance the effect of the way their muscles look with deeper tans. “Bodybuilding has gotten really popular in Belfast, and so have the tanning injections with it,” said Ben. “I don’t compete in bodybuilding or go on stage, I just like to work out and feel healthy. Tanning is a big part of bodybuilding. A lot of bodybuilders take tanning injections. “My mum thinks I look like an idiot but I don’t care, I like it. “I worry about Hannah sometimes because cancer runs her family, and she goes into the sun bed for longer than me usually. I normally do  minutes while she does longer. “I don’t have a history of cancer in my family so I don’t really worry about myself. I don’t know much about the side effects of the injections.”   Users of Melanotan are able to buy it through Facebook groups and some beauty salons and gyms.The vial is mixed with water and injected under the skin. Hannah and Ben take around iu dosage each time they use it. “The injection doesn’t hurt,” she said. “You just feel a bit sick and lose your appetite for a couple of days.” The substance is created in a lab and increases the levels of a natural pigment in the skin called melanin, which responds to sunlight and causes darker skin, hair and eyes. Increasing it in your body using tanning injections allows your skin to go darker under the ultravioletlight of the sun or a sun bed. The UK National Health Servicewarns people on its website against using Melanotan, saying it is not legal because it has not been tested and approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .    Because it is injected and users might share needles, other concerns about Melanotan include the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases like hepatitis or infections from injecting non-sterilised water. Despite the other health risks of too much sunlight or sun beds, Hannah is not ready to quit tanning. “One of the main reasons I do it is I don’t need to wear much makeup,” she said. Tanned skin looks better and it saves me lots of time going out or to work. “I’m not going to go any darker at the moment but I probably will in the summer, and that will spark off all the abuse again. “But it’s OK, we’re kind of used to it now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teen earns more 260k naming","story":"NewsTeen earns more than £K naming , babies for complete strangersBeau Jessup set up Special Name in  after her dads friend asked her to help name his three-year-old daughterShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsBeau Jessup \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old student has made thousands of pounds by naming the children of complete strangers. Beau Jessup got the idea for her unusual company when she was asked to help pick an aposEnglish nameapos for her dadaposs friend during a trip to China. She discovered that lots of parents want their child to have two names - a traditional one using Chinese character and a more Western alternative. They believe having a traditional English name, which is easy to pronounce, read and write, will increase their chance of getting jobs and university places abroad when they grow up. But restricted access to the internet in China means citizens are unable to use standard baby-naming websites that many people use in the UK. Beau - who attended the £,-a-year Cheltenham Ladiesapos College - said that has resulted in some parents accidentally picking bizarre names for their kids like Rolex, Cinderella, Rambo and Gandalf.   So she decided to set up her own business and in  launched Special Name , a website which picks names which match a childaposs personality.She named the first , babies for free to promote and grow the site, and then started to charge p per name.Since then sheaposs named more than , babies and has made more than £,, reports MamaMia .

Your English name stays with you for le. But I also heard lots of examples where people had chosen culturally inappropriate English names theyaposd heard from films or read online and realised there was an opportunity to help Chinese people get it right from the start.    Specialname relies on the Chinese tradition of creating unique name for children. The site invites parents to select from a list of  personality traits - including sensitive, honest, creative and clever - to match their aspirations for their child. Three shortlisted names are then presented, along with their meaning and a famous namesake such as Grace Kelly or Catherine Middleton. Parents can share the options with friends and family via messaging app We-Chat - the Chinese equivalent to WhatsApp - so they can help make the final choice. The naming service costs p for three names and take just three minutes to complete. After making their choice, users are sent a naming certicate to keep forever.    Her website states: I am the CEO and founder of Special Name in the UK - Beau Rose Jessup. In the past  years, I have visited China frequently. Whenever I am in China, I am often asked by my colleagues to help them and their children to take a special English name. Like Chinese names, when you meet friends or work partners, they will associate the English name with your childaposs personality, and the name will leave a first impression on others. Therefore, giving a child a name is not only a very high honor but also a major responsibility. In the future, your childaposs English name will appear on their college application or on a business card. Their names should represent the image they want to be remembered.

The suspicious sighting came from tourist Carole Tranmer, who was visiting her aunt at the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal. As part of a new Netflix documentary on Madeleine, titled The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, Caroleaposs sighting is told via Investigator and author Anthony Summers. He said: Carole was looking out of the window. She said, aposLooking down below the McCann flat I saw someone come out of the ground floor apartment closing the gate very carefully and quietly.    aposIt looked very strange to me. aposHe looked to one side and the other, shut the gate and walked very quickly below.apos This is on the afternoon of the day Madeleine is going to disappear. What had struck her as peculiar, she said, was aposthe way the man had closed the little gate down there. Anthony goes on to describe how Caroleaposs attention was captured by how stealthily the man was moving, aposashe didnapost want anyone to know he was coming or goingapos. The new eight-part documentary explores the events leading up to Maddieaposs disappearance, the night she vanished and the years-long search to find her. Madeleine had been on holiday with her parents, siblings and a wider group of Kate and Gerryaposs friends when she disappeared on May , .    Her parents were dining at a Tapas bar a short walk from the apartment where she had been left to sleep with her two younger twin siblings. According to the Netflix show, Kate and Gerry had been taking it in turns to check on the children throughout the night. At around pm, Kate made a check to the apartment, where she found Maddieaposs bed empty. The documentary looks at ious police theories investigated in the months following that night - including that her own parents had somehow been involved. One theory centred on the McCannaposs accidentally killing Maddie by giving her too much Calpol.    Anthony Summers told the showaposs producers: By late summer there was an implication that they [the children] may have over-sedated her by administering a drug. His co-author, Robbyn Swan, said: Essentially the Portuguese copsapos case against the McCannaposs involved the following: that she died by accident on May  that the supposed checks on the children had been concocted that they had hidden their daughteraposs body... and that her body had subsequently been transported in the rental car they had rented some weeks later. All claims of the McCannaposs being involved were completely discrtedited.

Emily Ince, , from Preston, was with  friends on the dream holiday when they were approached by three men offering a snorkelling tour in the seaside resort of Hua Hin. But the French and Spanish student claims after she and her pals joined the tour - paying £ each - they were told to jump out of the speed boat near an island. They claim they were then told to swim to shore before the men threw just three snorkelling masks into the water for the group of  and advised them to stay away from the snakes.

Us being gullible, we said aposyeah okayapos because it was about  baht each - around £ to £ - so we thought it was a good deal. I was in the first group and we were really excited, but as we came close to the island, they stopped the boat about ten metres away and made us swim from the boat to the island. When we eventually got on the island, the three men just chucked us two snorkelling masksand advised we keep away from the snakes. Understandably we were confused and a bit concerned about that, and then my friend got stung by a jellyfish whilst swimming over because the waters were infested with them.

But the doomed crew ran out of time before it hit the water, three people with knowledge of the cockpit voice recorder contents said. The investigation into the crash, which killed all  people on board in October, has taken on new relevance as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administrationand other regulators grounded the model last week after a second deadly accident in Ethiopia. Investigators examining the Indonesian crash are considering how a computer ordered the plane to e in response to data from a faulty sensor and whether the pilots had enough training to respond appropriately to the emergency, among other factors. It is the first time the voice recorder contents from the Lion Air flight have been made public. The three sources discussed them on condition of anonymity.  Reuters did not have access to the recording or transcript. A Lion Air spokesman said all data and information had been given to investigators and declined to comment further. The captain was at the controls of Lion Air flight JT when the nearly new jet took off from Jakarta, and the first officer was handling the radio, according to a preliminary report issued in November. Just two minutes into the flight, the first officer reported a flight control problem to air traffic control and said the pilots intended to maintain an altitude of , feet, the November report said.  The first officer did not specy the problem, but one source said airspeed was mentioned on the cockpit voice recording, and a second source said an indicator showed a problem on the captainaposs display but not the first officeraposs. The captain asked the first officer to check the quick reference handbook, which contains checklists for abnormal events, the first source said. For the next nine minutes, the jet warned pilots it was in a stall and pushed the nose down in response, the report showed. A stall is when the airflow over a planeaposs wings is too weak to generate lt and keep it flying.  The captain fought to climb, but the computer, still incorrectly sensing a stall, continued to push the nose down using the planeaposs trim system. Normally, trim adjusts an aircraftaposs control surfaces to ensure it flies straight and level. They didnapost seem to know the trim was moving down, the third source said. They thought only about airspeed and altitude. That was the only thing they talked about. Boeing Co declined to comment on Wednesday because the investigation was ongoing. The manufacturer has said there is a documented procedure to handle the situation.  A dferent crew on the same plane the evening before encountered the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists, according to the November report. But they did not pass on all of the information about the problems they encountered to the next crew, the report said. The pilots of JT remained calm for most of the flight, the three sources said. Near the end, the captain asked the first officer to fly while he checked the manual for a solution.  About one minute before the plane disappeared from radar, the captain asked air traffic control to clear other traffic below , feet and requested an altitude of five thou, or , feet, which was approved, the preliminary report said. As the -year-old captain tried in vain to find the right procedure in the handbook, the -year-old first officer was unable to control the plane, two of the sources said. The flight data recorder shows the final control column inputs from the first officer were weaker than the ones made earlier by the captain. It is like a test where there are  questions and when the time is up you have only answered , the third source said. So you panic. It is a time-out condition.  The Indian-born captain was silent at the end, all three sources said, while the Indonesian first officer said Allahu Akbar, or God is greatest, a common Arabic phrase in the majority-Muslim country that can be used to express excitement, shock, praise or distress. The plane then hit the water, killing all  people on board. French air accident investigation agency BEA said on Tuesday the flight data recorder in the Ethiopian crash that killed  people showed clear similarities to the Lion Air disaster. Since the Lion Air crash, Boeing has been pursuing a software upgrade to change how much authority is given to the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, a new anti-stall system developed for the  MAX.  The cause of the Lion Air crash has not been determined, but the preliminary report mentioned the Boeing system, a faulty, recently replaced sensor and the airlineaposs maintenance and training. On the same aircraft the evening before the crash, a captain at Lion Airaposs full-service sister carrier, Batik Air, was riding along in the cockpit and solved the similar flight control problems, two of the sources said. His presence on that flight, first reported by Bloomberg, was not disclosed in the preliminary report. The report also did not include data from the cockpit voice recorder, which was not recovered from the ocean floor until January.

The Cessna was spotted rocking violently from side to side as it made its approach. Footage from on the ground - captured on March  during Storm Eberhard - shows the Cessna  Citation Sovereign see-sawing on the approach. While hovering over the runway, the small plane bounces up and down as it comes down. As the plane is about to land, its left wing is dragged towards the tarmac floor, lting the opposite side of the plane into the air.  Eyewitness and experienced plane watcher who recorded the footage said: The unique thing is the storm raises one wing as far as the other almost touches the runway. Never before have I recorded such behavior of an aircraft.     Further footage captured at the same airport on the same day shows a Eurowings Bombardier Dash  Q making a crosswind approach. The Turboprop is tossed about, leading the pilot to abort the landing attempt and go round again.

It aims to open its third store at Myrekirk in August.If the fourth store is approved, it will put Aldi in direct competition with Sainsbury’s, also based in Tom Johnston Road.The threat of competition doesn’t worry Aldi bosses, who say their presence would “improve consumer choice”.And in planning documents the firm says it believes it can plug gaps in demand not catered for by the bigger supermarkets.It said: “Aldi is seeking to operate up to five foodstores to serve Dundee’s residents.“Food shopping habits have changed in recent years.“Consumers are now far more discerning in where they choose to shop and as such, increasingly expect easy access to a wide range of foodstore operators, with the likes of Aldi being part of this mix.“These trends have been re-inforced by feedback from the public and strongly suggest that a new Aldi store would help to meet qualitative and quantitative deficiencies in the catchment area.”The submission of its plans for a store on Tom Johnstone Road follows an extensive consultation process last month.The new store would create up to  jobs, including managers and store assistants.In addition, up to  jobs could be created in the two adjacent business units Aldi is including in the development, each , square metres in size.The proposal to build additional units – and possibly create jobs – is a tactic Aldi has employed before to make its proposals more appealing to planning chiefs.Its Arbroath Road store was built alongside blocks now occupied by pizza delivery chain Papa John’s, the charity Barnardo’s and bookies William Hill.And the firm believes a new unit at Claypotts would also ease the pressure on the Arbroath Road shop, which is suffering, it has been claimed, from “over-trading to the detriment of the customer experience”.Aldi’s plans are expected to be reviewed by the city’s planning committee in May."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee airport issues statement as people cant get through to book flights","story":"Dundee Airport has issued a statement to say its phone lines are down.In a Tweet, the airport, which is operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd , said BT was working on the issue and it hoped to have the matter resolved soon.mdash Dundee AirportMarch , Flights can still be booked via the firm#s website, at: hial dundee-airport The airport offers a twice-daily service to and from London Stansted."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mcintyre refuses to blame referee for celtic loss after 96th minute goal","story":"Boss Jim McIntyre believes the six minutes of injury time played by Bobby Madden at Dens Park yesterday was too long.However, the Dundee gaffer refused to blame the referee for the heart-breaking loss to Celtic that came via an Odsonne Edouard strike in the final few seconds of that extra period.When he did finally blow for time, home supporters booed the whistler off the park and clearly believed he’d cost their team a point.For Jim, though, the failure to take an excellent opportunity to snatch victory just seconds earlier was the cause of his team’s agonising demise.That came when substitute Andy Dales shot straight at Hoops keeper Scott Bain from the edge of the area when a better option seemed to play a pass.It allowed Celtic to go up the park and capitalise on an error by home skipper Martin Woods and grab the winner.“I fail to see where six minutes comes from. I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four. Six was a surprise.”The defeat, along with Hamilton Accies’ surprise win over Hearts on Saturday, means Dundee are now six points from safety down in the top flight drop zone.The postponement of St Mirren’s game at St Johnstone on Saturday because of snow means the Dark Blues remain a point above bottom."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face mammoth task against celtic but every point is vital says darren odea","story":"Every point is vital for Dundee now but experienced defender Darren O’Dea acknowledges they’ve got a “mammoth effort” ahead of them to get any from Celtic on Sunday.The league leaders and reigning champions head to Dens Park for a lunchtime kick-off on Sunday time as clear favourites to pick up the three points on offer.That would take them one step closer to an eighth-straight title but Irish international O’Dea has no interest in that despite his history with the Parkhead club – his only worry is getting points on the board for the Dark Blues.With the business end of the season on the horizon, the -year-old knows it’s vital Dundee get a leg up on their relegation rivals Hamilton and St Mirren.Despite the Dens men being as much as   with some bookies to pick up a victory, O’Dea has been part of Dundee sides that have picked up results against the Hoops – three goalless draws since his arrival in January .He told the Tele: “Every game is vital but Sunday doesn’t get much harder.“There have been games recently where we could’ve got more out of.“Since I’ve been here we’ve picked up some results against them both home and away but, one thing is for sure, it takes a mammoth effort.“It needs every player to be near the top of their game and we aim to do that this weekend.“It will be dficult and take a huge amount of effort but I don’t think effort is something we’ll have to worry about –we can get that wee bit of quality we’ve lacked at certain times, hopefully, we can pick up a result.”Dundee go into Sunday’s contest on the back of a poor run of form, losing their last three league matches against Hibs, Rangers and then Hearts.It’s not all doom and gloom for O’Dea, however, after an improved display in the - loss to the Jambos at Dens Park last Saturday.With chances spurned and a poor goal conceded, the Edinburgh side left with the points but the centre-half says Dundee can take a lot from their performance into Sunday, evenCeltic’s fluid frontline brings a dferent threat to the direct and physical approach from Craig Levein’s men last week.“Hearts aren’t embarrassed at the way they play and they shouldn’t be, they won the game, but Celtic will be a completely dferent style of play,” O’Dea said.“There are dferent ways to play against that, none of them easy, but the manager will figure out which way we go about it and we know we’re at the stage where every point is vital.”He added: “The Hearts game was scrappy, their style made it that way which is fine but they were very direct but they didn’t create too much.“The goal was an absolute stramash with bodies all over the place and they had Morrison with a shot just after but, bar that, I can’t think of any more shots they had on goal.“We were structured well as a team but we looked dangerous and for it being a really scrappy game we were the ones who created the moments of quality in the game.“For a final ball or a finish, % it wouldn’t have been undeserved to get a point or maybe more but we didn’t.“Now that’s neither here nor there, Hearts have three points and we don’t, but we can take positives from the performance.“We are in the business end of the season so it’s only results that matter but, in terms of endeavour and chances created, there are positives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee ice skating star natasha mckay dazzles

American owner to buy shares from them and increase his stake at Dens Park to over %.But while they’re unwilling to sell any of their shares, the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society have repeated support for plans to move to a new stadium near the city’s Camperdown Park.In January, Texas-based Tim Keyes, through majority shareholders in the Dark Blues Football Partners Scotland which he owns, had a move to buy the society’s ‘A’ Ordinary shares refused.They’re the shares that hold the power of veto over such matters as any sale of the club, a move from Dens and even substantial borrowing.Earlier this month Keyes then made an offer for the society’s Ordinary shares, a move that would give him .% of Dundee shares and the club said would allow them to claim Group Tax Relief to offset losses.After discussions with the club and their own membership, however, the society’s board have decided that’s a non-starter as well.In an alternative proposal, the club had asked the society to “agree to support resolutions which increase the club’s share capital and then allot shares specically to FPS”.That, too, however, has been rejected. The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee uniteds game at dunfermline called off","story":"Dundee United#s game at Dunfermline has been called off.The referee has deemed the East End Park pitch unplayable due to being waterlogged.The Fe club had released a statement at am saying there were no plans to hold a pitch inspection because the pitch was considered playable.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/028_Lottery_Dundee_Football_AR-Derek-Brough-Owen-McCartney-2.jpg ","title":"sponsored dundee football creating a force for good","story":"Two Dundonians have told of the common ingredient supporting their positive lestyles – football.DFC In The Community Trust and Dundee United Community Trust, both projects that have been supported by The National Lottery, have given a timely reminder of football’s ability to have a meaningful impact on the lives of locals. vw, px\"  Owen McCartney, , is a beneficiary of the work of DFC In The Community Trust, the charitable trust connected to Dundee Football Club.One of  school-age participants in the trust’s Dees Without Frontiers personal development programme, Owen has made huge strides in his home and school le since joining the project, progress noted by his family and friends as well as the club and trust.Owen said: “It’s really good being involved with Dees Without Frontiers because you’ve got people there to support you and help you through stuff andyou feel down you can speak to them.“During the course, we did things like making our own CV which helps you get a job and get into college.

They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

It is also recognition of their consistency for Aberdeen.”Although there is a pride for McInnes in having players involved with Scotland, there is also the worry his chargeshaving picked up injuries.The Dons lost centre-back Mikey Devlin for almost three months earlier this season after an ankle injury sustained in November during training with Scotland.McInnes added: “I’m pleased we’ve got players going on international duty. We’ve got pride, but there’s still that bit of dread for us with players being away about them potentially getting injured.“Obviously any player that is away on international duty is a very important player for us.“That goes right through the age groups right the way up to the senior team.“So it’s great that our players are recognised at international level.“But we just need to make sure they come back in a positive frame of mind and free from injury.”McInnes also believes seeing Shinnie and McKenna in the Scotland set-up gives other players in his Aberdeen squad something to aspire to.Earlier this term, Devlin was in the squad for the UEFA Nations League clashes with Albania and Israel before having to pull out due to injury, while winger Gary Mackay-Steven played in October’s - friendly defeat to Portugal and McInnes has said previously midfielder Lewis Ferguson – currently on Under- duty – should aim to make the step-up to the senior squad.McInnes said: “When there is evidence that you can be a full international at Aberdeen it gives others something to aim for.“It takes away that argument that maybe existed in the past about maybe needing to leave to be an international.“The evidence is there now with Shinnie and McKenna.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/logan-1.jpg ","title":"pals put aberdeens logan in full celtic kit for stag do","story":"Aberdeen#s Shay Logan has been dressed up in a full Celtic kit by pals as he heads for his stag do in Tenere.Logan is squeezing in the trip during the international break and his mates have taken the opportunity to poke fun at his fractious relationship with the Hoops.He posted this on Twitter: vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Patna Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future. It is understood ScotRail staff will neverto the dangerous building. It is believed they are to be housed in new portable cabins across the railway line at empty ground on Station Road. The option of a new new transport hub being built in the vicinity of Burns Statue Square has been mooted in the past. But no solid plan has emerged. Councillor Campbell said: “We maintain dialogue with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and Network Rail about future investment at the station. Once we are clearer about their intentions we will begin discussions on the future of Burns Statue Square. “ The council’s former regeneration contractor Ayr Renaissance was tasked with hiring consultants to redesign the space at the top of the High Street.

Ryan Paterson was thrilled to see his father James while he enjoyed an update as to how the construction of the new £m Barony Campus is going. Ryan, aged nine, attends Barshare Primary School, in Dalgleish Avenue, while his father is part of the Morrison Construction team, currently working at the Barony Campus site. So doting dad James is helping to build his son’s future- quite literally. And the pair were only too happy to pose for pictures. Joining Ryan on last Wednesday’s visit were some of his classmates at Barshare PS, while a group of pupils from Greenmill PS, in Barrhill Road, were also in attendance. The group were bowled over by the work going on to build the Barony Campus, which will incorporate The Robert Burns Academy, Hillside School, Lochnorris Primary and Cherry Trees Early Childhood Centre and see the following schools merge: Cumnock Academy, Auchinleck Academy Barshare Primary and nursery, Greenmill Primary and Hillside special needs school.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

There will be easy climbing, and therersquos two possible loops one at Ladhope and one at Langlee, so there is good potential at both ends for family route.ldquoThe other type of route we call lsquofit familyrsquo. Higher grade cycling, running, and walking, on higher ground.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, itrsquos a big area, the views are fantastic, and people will want to get up there. The only dficulty at the moment is getting up the steep slopes.ldquoSo the bulk of the multi use trail network will be building easy climb trails to get people to the top without too much stress.However, horse riders have voiced concerns over the plans which will could see more mountain bikes sharing the paths with horse riders.And local residents Diane Leaver and Susan Burrow, both of Langlee Mains, attended the meeting.Ms Leaver told councillors: ldquoWersquove already had a handful of incidents with bikes coming down the road to Langlee Mains fast and with dferent residents coming round a steep corner, and the bikes coming the other way.ldquoFortunately they have been far enough away to be able to stop so there hasnrsquot been an accident yet, but, you cannot see cars coming up until yoursquore almost at the junction.Ms Burrow added: ldquoThe main concern is the specic mountain bike tracks, because although where they join the core paths there will be bits for them to slow up, Irsquom not sure that will be enough.,params: .pushldquoMy question is, will I be able to rise safely  Sometimes when wersquore riding along they go lsquooff-pistersquo so to speak, and so therefore therersquos nothing to slow them up.Galashiels and District councillor Harry Scott also voice concerns at the plans, but his main concern is that there isnrsquot ample parking for visitors.He told the committee: ldquoI have mixed feelings about this, Irsquoll be honest with you. The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this.

It just wasnrsquot the person we were expecting.But thatrsquos le on the fictional isles for you. Like Forrest Gumprsquos box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get, apart from the nut cluster that is murder. This series has dealt with the topical subject of people trafficking, with DI Jimmy Perezbeing put through the emotional wringer. While he has encountered some right wrong lsquouns before, the buying and selling of human beings brought him face to face with real evil. Even his beloved daughter Cassie was threatened, which in Perez terms is grounds for declaring global thermonuclear war.Letters: Henshall has a cheekThe story began with a brother looking for his kidnapped sister. Five weeks in and Perez, Tosh and Sandy still hadnrsquot found Zezi. Time was running out, as was the will to live of Zezirsquos mother . Writer David Kane extracted every ounce of tension he could from the will-they-wonrsquot-they find her in time situation, culminating in one devilishly manipulative, and highly effective, scene.While one does not like to cast doubts on his professionalism, Perez has been rather distracted on this case by the presence on Shetland of the lovely Alice, who reckoned she couldnrsquot live without him, and to heck with her husband.Meanwhile, Toshdecided the IT manager at the local fish factory was quite a catch, but with the place closing down it looked like he might have to move south, unless Tosh could learn to trust again and declare her feelings.With all this hearts and flowers nonsense going on you can see why poor Zezi had to wait so long to be found. Then it was time for Perez to do what he does best: lock up the bad guys and apologise to everyone he had offended along the way. It is not easy being a non-caped crusader for justice. Mistakes can happen in the pursuit of truth, things are said that cannot be unsaid.How the series beganThe offer of dinner round at Perezrsquos was not enough to persuade Alice to stick around. ldquoYou need to be apart from the rest of us, she told Perez, condemning him to a letime of gazing out to sea with the collar of his reefer jacket turned up.Crushed like a grape by Alicersquos decision, there was nothing for him to do but go home, where Duncan, Cassiersquos birth father, Perezrsquos co-parent and lodger, and Maryrsquos estranged husband, was preparing to leave. Perez had upset Duncan in a previous series by arresting him during a murder inquiry. This time he had accused him of knowingly renting a property to people traffickers. Awk-ward!There had been enough love lost today, though. ldquoDonrsquot go, Perez pleaded, offering as a sweetener to invest in Duncanrsquos new bar. A cash-strapped Duncan accepted, which keeps him round for series six, where he will doubtless be unfairly accused of crimes against humanity and helicoptered to The Hague to stand trial.All that is in the television future. For now, Perez suggested the balm for all hurt feelings and rotten days: pizza. Duncan, distracted by paperwork, murmured, ldquoThat would be great, Mary. Perez stared at him, speechless. Oh dear. What now  But there it was, a twinkle ing to those baby blues, a smile spreading across his lips like melted mozzarella.ldquoSure thing, Fran, he replied, referring to his late we, the woman who had brought the two men together. They might be Shetlandrsquos oddest couple, this Scottish Felix and Oscar, but they rub along together nicely, accusation hurling aside.

A kind of fatalism has descended. MPs are exhausted with the effort of having to find new ways to say what they donrsquot want. The Government has started to talk in riddles, and Mrs May has lost her voice altogether. Brussels is finding our quaint parliamentary antics amusing, like a rerun of Monty Python. Angela Merkel and Mrs May seem agreed now that the best thing to do is suspend Article , so that everyone can continue doing nothing for another three months or even two years.Mind you, there have been some signicant developments beneath the surface non-events. Labour has finally started talking with the SNP, LibDems and supporters of a Norway Plus option. This will at least force Jeremy Corbyn to find new ways of not agreeing with them.

They all want to be able to blame each for whatever happens after Brexit Day. The SNP supported the single market EEA option in two white papers and one General Election manesto, but is now focused on a second referendum.For their part, many Tory and Labour Brexiters ndash the more sentient ones ndash are getting seriously worried that, by continuing to reject Mrs Mayrsquos deal, they may lose Brexit altogether. This is an entirely rational fear. About the only thing the Commons has managed to agree upon is that it doesnrsquot want a no-deal Brexit. Conservative websites like Guido Fawkes and Conservative Home are humming with arguments from Brexiters, like the former minister, Esther McVey, saying that Mrs Mayrsquos deal may be worse than remaining in the European Union, but theyrsquoll vote for it anyway. Though a hard core of Moggists will never submit.The Commons has also said that it doesnrsquot want a repeat referendum on Brexit ndash at least that was the overwhelming result of last weekrsquos Peoplersquos Vote amendment. I still havenrsquot heard a convincing argument for why most Remainers refused to vote for this proposal, even though it came from the Independent Group of Labour rebels. It will be hard, following Mr Bercowrsquos ruling on not putting repeat questions to the Commons, to find another direct way of proposing it next week.Instead, we have the Kyle Wilson amendment from two Labour MPs who want their party to vote for Mrs Mayrsquos deal on the condition that it is put to a ldquoconfirmation ballot of the people in a referendum. There are two problems with this. First, it means Labour actually voting for a deal that it has repeatedly said is an abomination, threat to jobs, undemocratic and so on and second, there is no guarantee that the referendum would come out the right way.:May could seek Brexit vote just  hours before EU departureI donrsquot see how a repeat referendum could exclude No Deal, since that is what many people thought they were voting for in . Labour might want its preferred option on the ballot too. This could leave us with a complex multi-option referendum, in which no one would win or lose convincingly. It would also mean the removal of Mrs May, since she has said repeatedly that she will never accept a referendum.It could come to that. Itrsquos an open secret that the Government whips have been suggesting to Brexit MPs thatthey back Mrs May next week they can also sack her at the same time. For many, this must be tempting. Yes, it would mean supporting a deal they loathe, but it would perhaps mean getting Boris Johnson into Downing Street. Incomprehensible though it may be, the former London Mayor is still extremely popular among the Tory membership. And hersquos recently cut his hair to show that he isnrsquot a wild child any more.Come to think of it, the prospect of Boris Johnson in No  might be the one thing that forces Labour and mainstream Tory MPs to unite in extremis behind Mrs Mayrsquos deal.

However, it does not tell us whether those results were achieved in fth or sixth year, so favours schools where more pupils stay on.The measure also takes no account of how many pupils are in a year group meaning small schools can yo-yo up and down based on the results of a handful of pupils.The major issue with tables, which is almost impossible to address, is that they donrsquot take any account of the social mix of a school. Because deprivation has such a signicant impact on exam performance, tables tend to make schools in middle-class areas look better than those serving more erse or disadvantaged communities.Read more:Poor pupils improve exam results, but gap with the richest widensThis is not necessarily anything to do with the quality of the school, but simply because schools in leafy suburbs have a higher proportion of pupils from richer backgrounds who tend to perform better in exams.It should also be remembered that the figures are not worked out as a proportion of those who sat Highers, but as a percentage of the overall S roll, meaning the figures are not a ldquopass rate at Higher.To give greater context to the data, we publish the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquovirtual comparator benchmark showing how a school should be performing.We also publish the proportion of pupils from the poorest neighbourhoods to give further context."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-theresa-may-asks-european-council-for-three-month-delay","story":"In a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk, Mrs May said that she did not believe it was in either the UKrsquos or the EUrsquos interests for Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May.:Theresa May seeks short Brexit delay amid Tory tensionsShe told MPs that she intends to table the Withdrawal Agreement which she has negotiated with the EU for a third time in the Commons next week, in the hope of overturning the massive defeats inflicted on it in January and March.Brussels has made clear that any extension of the Article  negotiation process beyond the end of June would require the UK to elect MEPs to take their seats in the next European Parliament in July.Mrs May told PMQs: ldquoThe idea that three years after voting to leave the EU, the people of this country should be asked to elect a new set of MEPs is, I believe, unacceptable.ldquoIt would be a failure to deliver on the referendum decision this House said it would deliver.ldquoI have therefore this morning written to President Tuskhellip informing him that the UK seeks an extension to the Article  period until June .Mrs May will formally make her request to the European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, where the unanimous approval of all  remaining member states is required for any extension.In her letter to Mr Tusk, Mrs May said that it remains the Governmentrsquos policy to take the UK out of the EU ldquoin an orderly manner on the basis of the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration agreed in November and supplemented by documents agreed with Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last week.The Agreement was rejected by  votes in January and  votes earlier this month.:Speaker John Bercow thwarts third vote on Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal without lsquosubstantialrsquo changesAnd Commons Speaker John Bercow this week said he would not allow the same motion to be brought again during this session of Parliament, unless it was substantially changed.But Mrs May told the Commons: ldquoThe Government intends to bring forward proposals for a third meaningful vote.ldquoIf that vote is passed, the extension will give the House time to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up. Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The crucial thing for all farmers and crofters to bear in mind is that, as things stand, it is business as usual for all CAP schemes and that includes completing this year’s SAF.“The SAF window, which will run from  March to  May, will be punctured by Brexit headlines but we don’t want anyone to inadvertently be distracted from this important process. SAF forms are the most important forms that Scottish farmers fill out every year and I would encourage all members to begin working on their forms as soon as possible to ensure they meet the  May deadline.“For the second year, paper forms will not be automatically sent out by post, with the Scottish Government continuing to encourage claimants to complete their SAF online. Whether you are happy to switch to online or are sticking to paper, the important thing is to take plenty of time and not leave it to the last-minute.

On top of a six-euro nightly tourist tax, the city is now considering imposing an entrance fee of up to ten eurosduring peak periods.Edinburgh has not reached that point yet, but it is clear many people are unhappy about the current situation, amid fears that it will become a ‘doughnut’ city with a Disneyland theme park version of itself in the centre, surrounded by the real city where people actually live. That said, tourism is a major part of the economy of Edinburgh and Scotland as a whole. There are plenty of places around the world which would love to be as popular. If we were to discourage visitors – and some would say complaining about their presence may already be starting to do that – we would almost certainly regret our actions when they take their business where.: Tourism ‘tearing up fabric’ of Edinburgh, warns Val McDermidThe trick is to remain as welcoming as ever, while finding ways to alleviate problems for locals. The partial closure of Edinburgh’s Royal Mile to traffic created a venue for performers during the Festival Fringe, but it has clearly become too congested. Expanding events to other locations such as Leith would help spread out tourists, making the experience more enjoyable for them and less of a hassle for people trying to get on with everyday le. Similarly, there is a need for greater help for tourists to enable them to discover quieter parts of the country, such as the Borders and Dumfries  Galloway, as Irvine suggests. Skye is a beautul island, but it’s not the only one – Scotland has dozens to discover. Better planning seems key.We do need to be alive to both the economic benefits and the problems that can be caused by tourism. But we also should not simply look at this as a matter of pounds and pence. It is sometimes forgotten that the provision of hospitality is an age-old duty. Providing a welcome to people visiting what is to them a foreign land is the right thing to do.

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland land ownership damaging communities in some areas","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Concentrated land ownership appears to be causing #signicant and long-term damage# to communities in some parts of Scotland, a report has found.The Scottish Land Commission report found that power is being abused in some areas of the country as a result of inidual behaviour, and that there is little or no method of redress for communities or iniduals affected.It said there is an urgent need for the introduction of a formal mechanism that would enable “harmful land monopolies” to be identied and calls for changes in either ownership and or management practice to protect fragile rural communities from the “irresponsible exercise of power”.: Scottish water the answer as England tipped to run dry in  yearsMore than  people, from land owners and land managers to community representatives and iniduals, submitted evidence for the report.It found that most of the disadvantages associated with Scotland’s current pattern of land ownership relate to a concentration of social, economic and decision-making powers, not simply the size of land holdings.Hamish Trench, chief executive of The Scottish Land Commission, said: “Concern about the impacts of concentrated land ownership in Scotland has long been central to the land reform debate. This evidence report allows us to move on from debating whether ownership is an issue, to understanding what the issues are and how they can be addressed.“The evidence we have collected shows clearly that it is the concentration of power associated with land ownership, rather than necessarily the scale of land holding, that has a signicant impact on the public interest, for example in relation to economic opportunities, housing and community development.“Good management can of course reduce the risks associated with the concentration of power and decision-making, but the evidence shows that adverse impacts are causing signicant detriment to the communities affected.“This points to the need for systemic change beyond simply a focus on good management.”The report found that problems are not associated exclusively with any particular type of land owner.Titled Investigation Into The Issues Associated With Large Scale And Concentrated Land Ownership In Scotland, the study is published alongside a set of recommendations to Scottish Government ministers, who asked the commission to examine the issues.Recommendations include the introduction of a public interest test and approval mechanism at the point of signicant land transfer and an obligation for larger land holdings to engage on and publish a management plan.The commission also recommends a review mechanism to address adverse impacts on communities where normal responsible management approaches are not effective.Sarah-Jane Laing, executive director of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents land owners, said: “There are a number of findings in this new report which private land owners already put into practice as part of their progressive approach to owning and managing land.“However, we are deeply concerned that the report still sees land ownership rather than land use as the prime route to dealing with issues being faced by communities. Nor does the report adequately reflect the positive and substantial contribution made by rural businesses.”She added: “We also want to see more detailed and compelling examples to support the report’s claim that concentrated land ownership is damaging fragile communities.“The stereotypical view of land owners held by some simply do not reflect current day reality.”She said land owners generally operate as modern businesses involved in a range of sectors and are subject to a vast range of regulation and legislation.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

This could include a retail space, eatery and cook school.It is hoped that the findings will provide a starting point for discussion of how to develop such an asset.The report highlighted opportunities in food tourism, providing experiences for cruise ship passengers and tapping into a growing demand for high-quality food and drink.Shetland Fishermen#s Association policy officer Sheila Keith said: #We initiated this feasibility study after witnessing what other countries do to promote their seafood and food and drink industries to their communities and beyond.

It#s in all our interests to better promote and market Shetland produce. If this report can be a catalyst for more collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship in the sector, then it will have achieved its aims.#SFPO chief executive Brian Isbister said: #The food and drinks industry in Shetland is bigger than any other industry in these islands, exceeding the value of oil, gas, agriculture, and tourism combined.#Despite that, we still have a long way to go in terms of properly showcasing what Shetland produces, as well as tapping into the growing demand for food and drink with great provenance.#Shetland Food and Drink chairwoman Marian Armitage said: #We know from our experiences from the Taste of Shetland Pop-up last summer that there is a healthy and growing demand for local produce from both Shetlanders and visitors.#There is an opportunity not only to connect with visitors while they are here – eventhat time is limited – but to stay connected with them when theyhome. Any activities which make it easy to access local produce within and outwith Shetland have to be a good thing for the sector.#The consultants used a combination of desk research, online surveys and telephone interviews as background to conduct the study.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age.

It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37925662.ece/b9249/AUTOCROP/w620h342/BT_06385.jpg","title":"cookstown hotel crush horror people were scratching biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath says witness","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Sometimes they even block part of it. I have to pull out onto the middle of the road before I can get a clear view of oncoming cars.He continued: ldquoA lot of the cars are driven by R drivers from the nearby Down High School. There have been problems with cars parking on the road ever since I moved in here four years ago. Irsquove tried everything in the past to get something done.

But the Department ruled out the installation of a yellow parking line around Cedar Court.He said: ldquoAs the entrance into Cedar Court is a private entrance and does not form part of the adopted road network, the Department is unable to introduce corner waiting restrictions at this location.ldquoIt is, however, an offence to park across a private entrance, or on a footway, in such a manner to cause an obstruction, whether waiting restrictions are in place or not.ldquoIn the past officials have spoken with Down High School to highlight the issue, the last time being in October, . This previously had a positive effect and as such the Department will again speak to the school to ask pupils not to obstruct entrances and footways in a manner that causes inconvenience or danger to local residents.ldquoHowever,this parking behaviour does continue, then it should be reported to the PSNI, who have the power to address these issues.The principal of Down High School, Mrs Maud Perry, said that she was aware of the issue.ldquoThe safety of pedestrians and road users is of utmost importance. Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that.

Those people talk of her apparent lack of remorse for joining Islamic State, which she did in  when she left her East London home as a -year-old and travelled to Syria. Others, including myself feel somewhat sympathetic towards her.I am abhorred by the views she holds but I donrsquot believe her decision to leave her home and her family and travel to Syria is a story without complexities. I see a vulnerable child who was radicalised by extremists while on British soil, in an area of East London I used to call home. I see a young teenager who was married to an IS fighter within two weeks of arriving in Syria and has been brainwashed perhaps beyond repair after witnessing levels of violence and destruction that most of us wouldnrsquot even be able to contemplate. But most tragic of all, I see a young mother who, at just  years of age, has lost three children in the space of four years. To me, thatrsquos an unimaginable level of trauma. And no, she doesnrsquot deserve it. No one deserves such pain.Irsquom not condoning her actions or her behaviour. She should face the legal consequences of her actions. She should be tried in a British court for the crimes she has allegedly committed. That is, after all, why we have the rule of law. But wiping our hands of her and failing to act to protect her son before he died of pneumonia in a grim refugee camp, shows just how much, as a country, the UK has lost its moral compass.Irsquove heard a number of commentators conflating her situation with that of the hundreds of innocent people whorsquove suffered at the hands of IS, particularly the vulnerable Yazidi women who were captured and are now being used as sex slaves. The dference, of course, is that they did not sign up to be a part of the caliphate, like Ms Begum. I am equally horried by the plight of these women and their children.But why do incidents such as this one always come back to whataboutery  Nothing was ever solved by this derailing and deflection technique. It is hypocritical to suggest we should have cared less about Ms Begumrsquos three-week-old baby than those captured or indeed killed by IS. Innocent people are innocent people and we should care equally about each and every one.Just because there are innocent victims still at the behest of ISIS does not negate the fact that the rights of a baby have been ignored and that child has now died, a death that couldrsquove been prevented by the Home Secretary, Savid Javid, had he chosen compassion and humanity over appeasement and pandering to rising populism.Indeed, Ms Begumrsquos case has highlighted a dilemma facing many countries in Europe, ided over whether to allow IS members or supporters to come home and face prosecution or block them. In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Tyrone in Northern Ireland\"   owner of The Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown Co. Tyrone in Northern Ireland\"  Hotel owner arrested over St Patricks Day disco deaths Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told reporters: “If there is going to be a request for a long extension of Article  by the UK then there will need to be a very persuasive plan to go with that to explain why that’s needed and how they will use the time to conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been able to be agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process.”If the EU agrees an extension, MPs and peers will have to pass a statutory instrument within days to remove the date of March  from Brexit legislation.MPs will be given an opportunity in the House of Commons on Monday to debate how the process should go forward.And Mrs May is expected to seek a way of staging a third “meaningful vote” on her Withdrawal Agreement next week, despite Speaker John Bercow’s ruling that it must be substantially changed before being put before MPs again.Downing Street sources dismissed reports that the vote, known in Westminster as MV, is slated to take place on the eve of Brexit on March , insisting that no date has been decided.Talks are expected to continue with the DUP ahead of any vote in the hope of overturning its defeat by a margin of  last week.But it is understood that the Government is still far from any agreement with the Northern Irish party that would allow its  MPs to back the PM’s deal.Jeremy Corbyn indicated that he sees Monday as the point for Labour to mount a challenge to the Government’s approach.Speaking after talks with other opposition parties and Labour backbenchers on the way forward, Mr Corbyn said: “If the Government can’t get a majority for its way on Monday, then I think that’s the time to challenge this Government.“The reality is that this Government has lost its authority, doesn’t enjoy the confidence of the House, can’t get anything through.“Surely that is the time to step aside and let the people decide in a people’s vote that’s called a general election.”He added: “I hope that on Monday the House will come together and support some sensible alternatives that can be negotiated during an extension period with the EU.”try catch

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The condition can go undetected for years, and by the time of diagnosis one in three people already have complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.With , people in Wales at risk of developing Type  diabetes, Diabetes UK Cymru wants to raise awareness of the risk factors so people can take steps to look after their health and prevent or delay the onset of the condition and serious complications.Dai Williams, national director, Diabetes UK Cymru, said: ldquoDiabetes is Walesrsquo biggest and fastest-growing health crisis.It costs the NHS in Wales over a pound billion a year, the majority of which is spent on treating largely preventable complications.ldquoWe urge everyone to find out their risk of developing Type  diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.To find out your risk of developing Type  diabetes, go to https:www.diabetes.org.uk riskscore article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I think thatrsquos a shameful view to take.Despite my long running campaign with our Labour Police and Crime Commissioner, the Tories have yet to ensure fair funding for Cardf and for South Wales Police.Officers here are doing a great job across south Wales, in community centres, schools and shops, raising awareness of kne crime and the dangers of carrying a kne.But just last week the Chief Constable stressed thatproperly funded to cover the needs of policing a capital city with the additional pressures that presents, he could put  additional officers onto issues such as this.Itrsquos simply not good enough from the Prime Minister, when kne crime is on the increase.Meanwhile my constituency appointments included a visit to the Salvation Army-run T# Gobaith Lehouse just across the Bay, to see how they are helping people rebuild their lives and escape homelessness.I spoke to some of the people who are staying at the centre having become homeless for a whole range of reasons, and heard some incredible stories of lives being turned around.It was inspiring to hear how, thanks to the dedicated staff, they are getting a fresh start in le, building up their confidence through le skills training, adult education and counselling.I was also delighted that our Penarth and Vale Labour councillors have been fighting to secure an agreement from the Vale of Glamorgan Council to allocate funds to ensure the a b bus services through Llandough, including the hospital, can continue. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

Local girl Eimear Tallon summed up the incident in a moving and heartbreaking online blog.She wrote: “It started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started.“The people on the outside of this line were so determined to get in they felt the need to not only push us against the wall but push with all their strength. No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement.Teenage victims of the disco horror“Two of my friends fell to the ground. I tried to pull them up but at that point there was no room for them to even come back up.

Not one bit of movement.“I could still see people laughing with no idea what was going on. At this point I thought my friends were going to die, I was standing up and I couldn’t breath so I couldn’t imagine how they felt. I was hysterically screaming for people to move but it was only the people around me who knew the seriousness.“With more and more pushing, I also fell. But the thing about me was that I wasn’t on the ground, I was on top of someone, and this person was on top of someone . As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my le.“I was looking about for my friends and trying to keep my head up. As dramatic as it sounds, I closed my eyes for a little and accepted what was going to happen however, an elbow to my throat soon woke me up. People were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath. I think that’s what really shows the seriousness of it all, people were literally fighting for their lives.“It got to a point where even when I had my eyes open, I couldn’t see. It felt like this went on forever but eventually I felt bodies being dragged over me and beside me. It wasn’t the bouncers and it wasn’t the police, it was the young people in the line who pulled me out.“My leg was caught underneath someone and my hair was caught somewhere , my jeans were pulled down around my thighs and my jersey above my head but I was getting pulled out nonetheless. I lay on the ground and opened my eyes, I remember seeing some motionless legs, a few socks and shoes and then I was pulled up and brought away.“I rang my parents to explain what had happened and let them know I was okay, I then tried to find my friends. I ran about frantically. I seen a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I seen his friends screech as they found out he wasn’t going to make it.“I don’t think I will ever experience more relief in my le than when I seen one of my friends that had fallen, I was shocked she was alive. We all eventually found each other apart from my other friend that had fallen. We heard people had seen him, that he was roughed up but he was okay, I needed to see him myself though. He then came running towards us sobbing and all we could do was hug him.“These ‘people’ aren’t just ‘people’, they were young people, teenagers at   years old. They were only children.“It could’ve been anyone.“Unfortunately, a friend of mine who I had seen in the line and chatted to minutes beforehand has died. Morgan and the two other angels, just like the rest of us, left their families last night for an enjoyable night out but unlike the rest of us, they didn’t make it home. My heart breaks for their poor families.“There is no sugar coating what happened last night. As it got serious, we banged the windows of the hotel and tried to get help. The people inside simply looked away. While this was happening the gates were still locked and the bouncers were no help.

INLM-gcOften her fees were waived for those who might struggle to pay and the respect she was held in the town was unparalleled.Rosemary came to prominence as the solicitor for some high profile republicans, including Colin Duffy.She also represented the family of Robbie Hamill who was killed after a barbaric kicking in Portadown in .She also worked as a solictor for the Garvaghy Residents Association during the Drumcree disputes in Portadown in the late s.However the vast majority of her clients were ordinary local people.Rosemary was killed in March ,  after a bomb exploded under her car outside her home close to a local primary school in Lurgan.The murder was claimed by the loyalist gang, the Red Hand Defenders however there was widespread concern of security force collusion in the murder.Mrs Nelson had previously complained that she had received numerous death threats and had voiced these concerns with the United Nations and US Congress.A public inquiry into her murder found no evidence that the security forces had ‘directlly facilitated’ her murder but ‘could not exclude the possibility’ that inidual members had helped the perpetrators.On her th anniversary her children paid tribute to their mother.In a statement on Friday they said: “Today marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

Even in her younger years she noted that the odds were stacked, but that didn’t stop her from hurtling towards opportunities and dismantling the obstacles anyway – for herself, and others, too.“For those who witnessed Rosemary in a professional setting, it was her steely faith which drew attention – that unfaltering conviction which commanded her working days. She instilled belief in her clients, and they in turn placed their confidence in her. “When it comes to the many at the receiving end of Rosemary’s help, it’s hard to determine just what their lingering memories are – but perhaps that’s the point. Through the power of her compassion, the four walls of the Lurgan office transformed into a confidential haven whereupon sadness was shielded fears unleashed and faith restored.“But for those closest to Rosemary – and lucky enough to occupy that special, padlocked component of her heart – she was so, so much more. “She sprinkled her laughter and zest-for-le passion upon any occasion, and set more than one meal alight during her cooking forays.“Though Rosemary’s driving was impressive, her sense of direction left a lot to be desired, and the sounds of the Lighthouse Family and Mary Black were the backdrop of choice to any long journey.“She loved her family and friends fiercely, and through her parents, siblings, husband, and children, her greatest fuel was forged.“And as the darkness of each night reared, Rosemary gathered her children before her as she wiped off her make-up chatting, laughing, and ensuring that a reaffirmation of love lulled them off to a peaceful sleep.“Today on the th anniversary, we’re hugely saddened as we reflect on the loss of Rosemary’s le. We grieve for the milestones which we should have shared the lessons which we were yet to learn the unwritten chapters which lay before us with hope and expectation.“But mostly we’re grateful for the blessings which Rosemary’s letime brought us. And as we continue to pave our own paths, we will always take fuel from her, just as she did from us.“Thank you, mum. We miss you.”Also on her anniversary some of her colleagues paid tribute to Mrs Nelson.KRW Law Human Rights said: “Thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of our esteemed professional colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.”Madden  Finucane Solicitors said: “Fond memories of our friend and colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.T”oday marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions. The CTA is not based on EU membership and is a long standing arrangements based on domestic legislation and agreements between the UK and Irish governments and deals with a range of issues. www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit will be updated as and when new information becomes clear and available.
