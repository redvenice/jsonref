They need to be much tougher.\u0027 The Department of Health and Social Care refused to say if staff have returned to the office. A spokesman from the FDA union representing civil servants did not know if mandarins had been instructed to come back in.And Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department could not get all their staff in because there is not enough space in their offices. Asked if he would have 100 per cent of civil servants back in the Department of Health this morning, he told Times Radio: \u0027No, because I didn\u0027t even have 100 per cent before that guidance, because one challenge I have in my department is that we\u0027ve had to increase the size of the department in the pandemic and we don\u0027t have space for everyone.\u0027We don\u0027t have a situation where we have 100 per cent at any time, but in general people that were working from home during Plan B, they are starting to slowly come back, and we want to do that like any employer in a safe way possible, so plans are being put in place now so they can start coming back into work, work from their desks, if that\u0027s what they were doing before.\u0027Earlier today, FDA general secretary Dave Penman tweeted: \u0027It\u0027s insulting because the PM said \u0027back to work\u0027 when everyone\u0027s continued to work hard whether from home or the office. And it\u0027s a strange world when Tory ministers feel able to lecture private enterprise on how to run their businesses.\u0027 A survey by the FDA one year ago found 97 per cent of civil servants want to retain the option of working from home after the pandemic ends, and one senior minister said last October that some were not returning because they \u0027just want to save their lunch and train fares\u0027. In addition, last September it emerged Treasury civil servants would be allowed to work from home indefinitely. Each government department can make its own decisions on how to manage hybrid working.    Mr Johnson said WFH guidance would be dropped immediately and rules on masks in schools would also be scrapped from today. Other restrictions including compulsory face coverings on public transport or in shops and Covid passes for entry to nightclubs and large events will end next Thursday. And the legal requirement for people with Covid to isolate will also be allowed to lapse when the regulations expire on March 24 - possibly even earlier. Bloomberg - Are you a robot?"},{"url":null,"title":"Electric car battery plant power Britains eco drive gets 100m cash injection","story":"Share this article It is due to open by early 2024, having gained planning permission last year.

England will face Switzerland on 26 March and will then host the two-time African champions on 29 March. They have never played the Ivorians at senior level and the friendly marks the first time they have faced non-European opposition since November 2018. The FA describes the match as “an important test for the Three Lions on the road to this year’s 2022 Fifa World Cup”. England are scheduled to play four Nations League fixtures in June, then complete Group A3 in September - the final international meet-up before the tournament in Qatar. Brentford have been linked with a move for former Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen, who is looking for a route back into football following his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. But Frank remains coy on those rumours and believes that even if he adds no new faces this month, Brentford can still enjoy a successful season. Wednesday’s 3-1 defeat by Manchester United was a fifth loss in six outings but Frank’s side remain a healthy 10 points clear of the relegation zone. “I think we have a strong enough squad to compete in the Premier League,” said Frank. “I do think a player or two would bring extra energy to the squad but I don’t think it’s essential. But we are always in the market and if a player comes up we will do it. “If you come from abroad you need to get up to speed to your new team, tactics, crazy ideas from the head coach! So there’s a risk that it can take a longer time to adapt.”  Villa go to Goodison Park tomorrow to play Everton, who sacked Benitez on Sunday following their defeat at the hands of NOrwich City. Gerrard played under Benitez for six years at Liverpool and admitted he was surprised the Spaniard wanted to manage Everton in the first place.  “I’m disappointed for Rafa because I’ve got a relationship with him and an awful lot of respect for him,” said Gerrard. “I have to be honest, I thought it was a unique appointment at the time. The fixture was postponed for a second time earlier this week. It was originally due to be played on December 15 but was called off due to Covid-19 cases within the Watford squad before an outbreak at Burnley forced the postponement of the rearranged match on 18 January. With both sides having already been knocked out of the FA Cup, it has been rescheduled for 5 February on the weekend of the fourth-round fixtures.Newcastle, who are 80 per cent owned by the Gulf state’s Public Investment Fund, will head off for a warm weather training camp at the weekend, although head coach Howe has insisted the focus will be entirely on football amid accusations of “sportswashing”.  “It’s a football decision,” said Eddie Howe, repeating the same phrase he used at his unveiling upon being asked if he had any concerns about taking the Newcastle job. “We’re doing it for the benefit of the players, the group, in our fight to stay in the ision, and that’s my only thought. “The facilities and everything around the trip are going to be first-class. We will train and we will train hard and we will train in preparation for our next game, so that’s always going to be my only focus.” Staff and PA Media.Last February 100,000 new shares were issued and he has purchased the final third of those, having already acquired 66 per cent 12 months ago. The move, announced in a letter to fans, provides a much-needed boost to Everton’s finances, having posted a combined £265m loss for the last three financial years. “I write to you to assure you that my commitment remains strong and focused,” he said in his letter. “The club has announced today the conversion of a £100m loan to the club into equity which is a clear demonstration of my commitment and greatly strengthens the balance sheet. “I am a private man and I do not speak publicly very often. But I promise you that my determination to deliver for Everton will not waiver.”  “We are delighted to announce that Hugo Lloris has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with the club, which will run until 2024,” purred a club statement.  “Captain of club and country, World Cup and Uefa Nations League winner with France, Hugo, 35, has racked up 395 appearances since his arrival from Lyon in August, 2012. “Already 14th in our all-time appearance list, he will soon become only the 12th player to make 400-plus appearances for us in all competitions. Only two goalkeepers – all-time greats Pat Jennings (590) and Ted Ditchburn (452) – have played more for us. “Outstanding since returning from a dislocated elbow suffered in October, 2019, Hugo is ever-present in the Premier League this season, and on a run of 67 successive starts in the league going back to the 1-1 draw at Burnley in March, 2020.” Leeds United, Manchester United and Brentford are all at home for the day’s three o’clock kick-offs, hosting Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves respectively, before Southampton welcome Manchester City to St Mary’s.

He is streaking away with this second set having been tested in the fourth game.After I said this match isn’t promising to explode into life, it immediately explodes into life. Khachanov produces the shot and the point of the match so far, threading a spectacular double-handed backhand around Nadal and down the line, and all that after having fallen over in hitting his initial return of serve ... The Spaniard is taken to deuce and eventually edges over the line to hold. That was a massive contest though and if Khachanov can continue to exert than kind of pressure on Nadal’s serve, it could be a longer night than we thought.Khachanov holds, in much more straightforward fashion than the last time. Still, this isn’t a match which is promising to explode into life – Nadal is firmly in control of his opponent.Nadal holds and opens up a 2-0 lead in the second set. Karatsev and Mannarino, the final match on today’s programme, are 2-2 in their first set. Nadal, finally, wears his Russian opponent down and breaks him after a marathon opening game in the second set. It looked like Khachanov might squeeze out the hold of serve but the quality of Nadal’s returning, and his trademark groundstrokes, was too much in the end.The Spaniard is firmly in control, a break up in the first set, and will serve to move within one game of taking this first set. The Spaniard is yet to lose a point on his own serve. “Going into this match I knew I had to be playing sharp if I wanted to give myself a chance, Naomi is always going to be playing well ... she’s an absolute champion ... I knew I had to step up my game and be aggressive and I think that’s what I did in the second set. Honestly I’m so grateful that I was able to play so well today and get this win, it means a lot. “Honestly, stepping on to the court, all I’m thinking about is having fun ... every single day here is just an amazing experience and opportunity for me, I’m so grateful to be playing on this court ... I’m just having fun and getting on the win on this day is a huge bonus, I’m just looking forward to my next round.”Anisimova holds impressively easily, conceding just a single point, and we’ll have a first-to-10 tiebreak to settle it. This has been a truly memorable match. Anisimova forces deuce on the Osaka serve ... but the Japanese player again finds a way, and now leads 6-5 in the final set of this enthralling match. Helpfully, Eurosport have ended their TV coverage of this game in favour of skiing, so I’ve had to race over to the app to catch the end of it.After a couple of lightning-fast service holds for each player, Anisimova must now serve to stay in the match.“I felt like I was out of my weight class, the way she hits the ball ... all in all I was able to use my slice effectively, particularly that short one.” “Both incredible ball strikers (Osaka and Anisimova) ... either match up is a little bit different, and I will change a few things up ... but the sliced backhand will come out, I promise.” Anisimova destroys a down-the-line forehand, on Osaka’s second serve, for 15-30. There are two pointed “Come ons” from Osaka as she claims the next two points for 40-30. And another, as she rounds off the hold with a thumping ace down the middle. Again, asked the question, Osaka comes up with the answer like the champion she is. This accurate serve out wide from Anisimova is causing so much damage. She holds to love. It’s 3-3 and nothing to choose between the players.A no-nonsense hold for Osaka. Both players are feeling the intensity of this match. Can Anisimova last the pace as they go deep into the third and final set? We are about to find out.A double fault brings 30-30 but Anisimova hits another booming wide serve which opens up the court and brings her game point. She holds for 2-2. This is a really exciting, close battle and although both players are making errors there is plenty of ambitious shot-making too.It’s all going swimmingly for Ash Barty on Rod Laver Arena, a break up in the second set.At 30-30, having just hit fractionally wide, Osaka hits long and it’s break point for Anisimova. Anisimova climbs into the second serve, but Osaka is absolutely rock-solid, winning back control of the rally and forcing the error, and saving the break point. Having said all that ... Osaka double-faults on the next point, sending her second serve wildly long, and hands her opponent another chance. Anisimova misses out, netting a big chance to take the game! Anisimova then crashes a forehand into the net on Osaka’s second serve, at deuce, and chucks her racket on to the floor in disgust. Osaka closes out the game. That was a big, big game in this match and Anisimova will be regretting those missed chances. Maybe she’ll get another one, maybe she won’t.A strong first serve down the middle for 15-0. An excellent serve out wide, and an unerring crosscourt double-handed backhand makes it 30-15. But then another double fault from Anisimova, and a fine angled drop from Osaka brings the two-times champion a break point. And yet ... a lovely volley at the net saves the break point, and Anisimova takes it up another gear to hold her serve and make it 1-1 in the first.Another unforced error from Osaka brings 15-30 for Anisimova on her opponent’s serve. Osaka produces a big first serve for 30-30, then Anisimova hits long, and looks frustrated to do so, to bring up game point for Osaka. Another error by Anisimova as she dumps a forehand into the net ... and Osaka edges ahead in the third set."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb20a7a714820c34ccfcef6b59c759cb676bb862/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=578bce21077070a32a65d96a16a012fe","title":"covid news live africa sees cases drop significantly experts say australias omicron wave likely peaked","story":"In a late-night news conference on Thursday, McGowan said reopening the state as planned would be “reckless and irresponsible” given the large number of Covid-19 cases in other states.

It welcomed the government’s decision to lift plan B restrictions but warned that consumer confidence might take longer to recover. Read more of Mark Sweney’s report here: Wagamama owner TRG expects to rise above the Omicron effect The EU drugs regulator said earlier this week it would be reasonable to give a fourth dose to people with severely weakened immune systems, but more evidence was needed. Ministers will discuss “the administration of the fourth dose,” said a press release issued by the French presidency of the EU, which organised the video-conference for health ministers at short notice. EU members Hungary and Denmark have already decided to roll out a fourth dose of Covid vaccines. Copenhagen said it would do so for the most vulnerable, while the Hungarian government said everybody could get it after a consultation with a doctor. The rollout of fourth doses began in Israel last month, making it the first country to administer the so-called second booster. Many, though, consider that more data is needed before making decisions on that. The French presidency said the video conference was meant to find a common approach at an EU level on vaccination strategies. The meeting will also discuss coordination of other Covid policies, including for possible new joint purchases of vaccines, as “vaccines adapted to variants are coming soon,” the French presidency said.Yesterday there were 38,850 new cases, the day before around 32,000. Reuters note that the Russian Covid taskforce also announced an official figure of 692 deaths yesterday.I will be carrying on here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world, including key Covid developments from the UK, so stay tuned.She said that while newly-introduced curbs in Tokyo and twelve other prefectures may have some impact on a public that has adapted to a “new normal” of behaviour over the past two years, promoting booster shots, building up testing capacity and protecting essential workers are more critical. “The response in these areas by the Cabinet seems to be very slow,” she added. One doctor told Reuters there appeared to be delays in imports of vaccines for boosters, as Japan depends on overseas drugmakers for almost all of its supplies. Another pointed to a decision to shut down mass vaccination centres after the main inoculation push last year, and the health ministry’s initial insistence on an eight-month gap between first-phase inoculations and booster shots. Makoto Shimoaraiso, a Cabinet official guiding Japan’s pandemic response, said that delays in regulatory approvals and reopening of inoculation sites had hampered the vaccine rollout. Japan’s initial inoculation push started off slowly before reaching up to 1.7m shots a day last year, and with boosters, “we can also see the same rapid increase,” he added. The country has recorded just over 2 million coronavirus cases and 18,461 deaths during the pandemic.“When you look at the infection situation, the quasi-state of emergency is inevitable,” said office worker Masayuki Fujii, 49. “However, we have to get the economy going.”On the future of Covid passes in Wales, he said their use would be reviewed on 10 February, saying they “will stay in place for a bit longer than some of the other protections we put in place.” Asked if people could expect that 10 February could mean the end for the Covid pass, he said: “I think it’s conceivable, but by no means guaranteed. We’ve just seen in the last week or so how fast things can change with this virus and 10 February is still three weeks away. “So if things continue to improve on that current rate, and we were in a position to lift some of the further protections, of course that’s what we want to do. But in Wales, we will only do it when we’re sure we have a clinical advice or scientific advice that would tell us that it will be safe to do that.”Authorities have warned that the latest wave of the pandemic will drive case numbers to levels as yet unseen in the European Union’s largest eastern member, putting severe strain on the health service. “In the coming days we will also have very high results, it worries us,” Waldemar Kraska told broadcaster Radio Plus, adding that daily cases would top 50,000 next week. A week ago daily cases were just over 16,000. Poland has a lower rate of vaccination than the EU average and the limited restrictions in place, such as wearing masks in enclosed public spaces, are often not strictly enforced. On Wednesday, health minister Adam Niedzielski said that state employees would move to remote working and private sector companies should follow suit in order to limit the spread of the virus. Guadeloupe and the nearby French island of Martinique have been hit by violent protests over the past few months, due partly to public anger over Covid restrictions. “The prefect condemns the unspeakable actions and offers its support to the injured person,” the statement said. Reuters remind us that a curfew was put in place in Guadeloupe at the end of last year in an effort to curb the sometimes violent protests. In Guadeloupe there has been mistrust of the French government’s handling of health crises since the 1970s when many islanders were exposed to toxic pesticides used in banana plantations.On Tuesday, government and health officials announced traces of the virus had been found on 11 hamsters, all in a pet shop where a 23-year-old staff member had fallen ill. They decided more than 2,000 of the imported animals, including any pets bought since 22 December, must be killed, and “strongly recommended” owners surrender their pets. For many, it was the final straw after two years of ad hoc and often illogical pandemic measures, and residents sprung into action, offering to hide or adopt the doomed pets. Tens of thousands signed petitions, while others offered to fake backdated receipts to before 22 December, the Washington Post reported. Groups gathered outside collection facilities urging people not to hand over their animals. One Causeway Bay woman, who gave the name Jessica, said she volunteered on a social media group to house a hamster, but was still waiting to be assigned one. “There are a lot of other volunteers,” she said. “I left a message saying which area I’m in, and that I could take one hamster because the flat I live in is small and I have a dog.

In the coming days I will manage security affairs from my home,” Gantz wrote on Twitter. Israel has shortened its mandatory isolation period for confirmed carriers to five days. Other senior Israeli cabinet members, including the foreign and finance ministers, have recently tested positive for Covid as well.Drakeford accused the UK Government of moving too fast to ease restrictions in England to distract attention from the scandals engulfing it. PA Media quote him saying: That figure would be reached under an optimistic scenario in which booster shots provide very good protection, Karl Lauterbach said in a discussion with state government leaders, sources involved in the talks told Reuters late on Thursday. The number could climb to more than 600,000 daily new cases if the booster shots were less protective, he said, according to the sources. Lauterbach also said he expected the numbers in intensive care in hospitals to increase significantly over coming weeks. Federal and state leaders will discuss on Monday measures to curb the increase.Pressed on whether it was wrong for schools to do so, he said: However, he then went on to say “I’m not here as the business secretary responsible for the economy, which I thought we’d be talking about, to tell school teachers and head teachers how they’re going to run schools.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 pandemic as we have known it is going to be behind us soon","story":"Chief medical officer  Dr Tony Holohan and other members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).  Once Nphet had vaccines as insurance last year, members relaxed considerably in their approach to Covid-19. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsWell, that is understandable, because we are moving into a new phase of dealing with the virus, where new rules apply.The pandemic as we have known it for two years is going to be behind us very soon. Covid-19 will still be a threat but not to the all-encompassing extent we have grown used to.Let’s start with the decision by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to approve the lifting of almost all Covid-19 restrictions, which is based on three key factors.The first is the existence of effective vaccines against the disease that have been taken by the vast majority of the population. Though these do not prevent transmission, they work very well to stop people getting seriously ill.Ministers are reportedly surprised at the willingness of public health officials to lift restrictions so quickly, but they shouldn’t be.Once Nphet had vaccines in their back-pocket as insurance last year, its members relaxed considerably in their approach. Yes, fresh restrictions were imposed in the second half of last year, but these were dictated primarily by the threat to a creaking health service.That has now passed. The second factor is the evidence, apparent for some weeks, that the current Omicron wave is not overwhelming hospitals. The peak of cases is behind us and all the indicators are currently pointing in the right direction.Omicron favourThirdly, Omicron has done us all a favour by decimating the previous, more virulent Delta variant. It has also clarified the approach needed from public health officials around the globe there’s little point in trying to duck and e with Omicron, as it is so transmissible that almost everyone is going to get it.Every day, about 125 million people are getting infected with Omicron, the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has estimated. This is 10 times higher than the Delta peak last year. By the end of March, more than half the world’s population is expected to have been infected, in just four months.But how can a disease so widespread be a good thing?As many as 90 per cent of these infections will be asymptomatic people will hardly notice them but they are benefitting from increased immunity.Throughout the pandemic, IHME models have been pessimistic yet accurate, and the institute has repeatedly called for higher levels of mask-wearing to protect against the virus.Yet this is what its director Prof Christopher Murray wrote in The Lancet this week: “The transmission intensity of Omicron is so high that policy actions-eg, increasing mask use, expanding vaccination coverage in people who have not been vaccinated, or delivering third doses of Covid-19 vaccines-taken in the next weeks will have limited impact on the course of the Omicron wave.”Mask useIncreasing use of masks to 80 per cent of the population, for example, will only reduce cumulative infections over the next four months by 10 per cent, his modelling suggests.“The speed of the Omicron wave is so fast that policy actions will have little effect on its course globally in the next four to six weeks,” Murray adds.This is the new ball-game, in which the return on enforcing restrictive measures in the context of a milder illness is so diminished as to be of little value.A combination of vaccine-induced (preferable for most people, because less risky) and infection-induced immunity is protecting against Covid-19 in Ireland, and will soon do the same in many other countries whose Omicron waves have yet to peak.The World Health Organisation was not wrong to say this week that the pandemic is “nowhere near over”. Other countries will see the number of patients in hospital rise, just as Ireland did after Christmas, but this should not last very long.So what will happen now? It won’t be all plain sailing. Our case numbers may rise as people get back to mixing more freely with others and colleges re-open.New variants will pop up, and we’ll have to deal with them. Even Delta has not gone away completely. AY.2, a potentially troublesome sub-lineage of Delta, is already leading to rising cases in Denmark, and will have to be watched closely.Waning immunityWaning vaccine immunity is a problem, one that could be solved in time for next winter by better vaccines. Winter 202223, when cases rise again and hospitals come under pressure, will be a challenge anyway.Covid-19 will be around for some time to bother us. We’ll be able to treat the vulnerable with antivirals and prevent them getting infected with masks and physical distancing. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools and other busy locations seems like a no-brainer. More genomic sequencing will be needed to spot AY.2 and emerging threats more quickly.Without realising it, many people have become “institutionalised” during the pandemic some will struggle with the freedoms offered as it ends. All of us will have to find the right balance that allows us to live again while feeling safe.That balance will vary hugely according to our perception of risk 20 years after the SARS outbreak, many people in Asia continued to wear masks in public places.For now, though, this phase is over. As Murray concludes, “after the Omicron wave, Covid-19 will return but the pandemic will not”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet clears way for extensive easing of covid 19 restrictions including end to 8pm curfew","story":"Restrictions on the 8pm curfew could be lifted from as early as this weekend. File photograph: Getty ImagesThe State’s public health team has cleared the way for the easing of almost all Covid-19 restrictions over the coming days.The National Public Health Emergency Team met on Thursday and agreed to recommend the removal of the 8pm closing time for hospitality and the end of the requirement for a Covid-19 pass to gain access to pubs and restaurants.The digital pass will still be needed for international travel, however. The team also cleared the way for the removal of crowd limits as well as an end to restrictions on permitted household guests. A phased return to work has also been recommended in order to give workplaces time to organise their own inidual public health measures, a source said.Some of the only restrictions to remain will be around the requirement to wear a mask in retail and on public transport, as well as existing public health measures in places likes schools. A source said that the recommendations went further than many in Government expected and represented a significant acceleration in terms of the path out of the pandemic. The Nphet members were understood to have discussed how the Covid-19 digital pass need no longer be required for access to hospitality given the high levels of either infection or vaccination in the population at present.Live venues and hospitality venues may return to normal capacity while restrictions around nightclubs are also expected to be lifted. A Government source said the main outstanding item will be a decision on what dates the various restrictions will be lifted by. Cabinet will meet on Friday to discuss the recommendations and decide how to proceed. It is expected that restrictions on the 8pm curfew for example, could be lifted from as early as this weekend although sources said the Government is keen to give the hospitality sector time to prepare.Reacting to news of the recommendations, Licensed Vintners Association chief executive Donall O’Keeffe, said: “The news coming from Nphet this evening has been eagerly awaited by the entire hospitality and late night sectors for a long, long time.“Hopefully the Government will now move swiftly and there will be no delays to the full reopening and the scrapping of hospitality restrictions. “Hospitality is ready and waiting to open our doors this weekend. If the Government gives the green light then the recovery of the hospitality and night time sectors could begin as early as Friday night,” he said.The Restaurants’ Association of Ireland and Vintners’ Federation of Ireland also welcomed the changes recommended by Nphet in its letter and both called for the extension of opening hours to proceed on Friday evening.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"government to approve lifting of almost all covid 19 restrictions today","story":"Nphet last night gave the go-ahead for the removal of almost all Covid restrictions, including a return to normal opening hours for hospitality and the end of the use of the digital pass for pubs and restaurants.

The Nphet letter came after days of signals from Government that it favoured an early end to restrictions, as evidence mounted that the peak of the Omicron wave had passed.However, mask-wearing in certain environments, including public transport and shops, is likely to be retained for the time being. It is also expected that schools will remain subject to mask regulations for now. Vaccination passWhile the requirement for the Covid-19 vaccination pass to access hospitality venues will be removed, it will remain for international travel.Capacity restrictions for indoor and outdoor events are also set to be removed, meaning the Six Nations rugby games in February and March can go ahead with full capacity crowds.Some Government sources expressed surprise that the recommendations went further than many expected, with one saying they represented a significant acceleration on the path out of the pandemic.Rules relating to contact tracing and isolation will remain in place, a source said.Both the Cabinet Covid-19 committee and a full Cabinet meeting will take place today and a decision will be made about the dates on which various restrictions will be lifted. It is expected the 8pm curfew, for example, could be lifted as early as this weekend, although sources said Government is keen to give the hospitality sector time to prepare.The Restaurants Association of Ireland last night called on the Government to allow all hospitality businesses to trade as normal from today.Licensed Vintners Association’s chief executive Donall O’Keeffe said the Government should “move swiftly” and that “hospitality is ready and waiting to open our doors this weekend.

There were 5,523 confirmed cases of Covid-19 yesterday, with a further 5,048 people registering a positive antigen test through the HSE portal the previous day. A total of 896 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, with 90 in ICU.Meanwhile, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar indicated the Government’s €1,000 Covid bonus would be extended to agency workers such as cleaners, nurses and paramedics in public hospitals contracted or seconded to the HSE during the pandemic.However, the bonus will not be extended to family carers and those in the private sector because of Government concerns about the potential cost.Gardaí called for the pandemic bonus to be extended to them with the Garda Representative Association (GRA) saying all frontline emergency workers should receive it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"oireachtas committee set up to examine international surrogacy","story":"At present the surrogate mother, who gives birth, is considered the legal mother of the child under Irish law.

It read: “We’re sorry if we seem intrusive, but we just want to make clear that we would be unwilling for two men in a partnership to view or buy our house.“As it is contrary to the gracious teaching in God’s Word, the Holy Bible, e.g Romans 1:24-28 and Jude 7 (King James Version).

Homophobia still exists, it is still out there. I did not see it coming. I was blindsided by it.”He reported their texts to Purplebricks, which was selling it via Rightmove, which has now decided to cease selling the property.A Purplebricks spokesperson said: “Purplebricks celebrates ersity and the message that Lachlan and Luke received is completely opposed to our views and values. We immediately contacted the seller to return their fee and request that they sell their property with a different agent.”This is not the first time that Ms Brunker and Mr Main have expressed their views on gay relationships - both of them wrote to a House of Lords Committee in 2019 outlining their views on how the subject should be handled in schools’ “relationship education”.Mr Main is listed as a director of LM Buildscapes, a company which was dissolved in 2011. Dr Bunker, who obtained her PhD at University College London, appeared on a 2017 YouTube video as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute at the University of Cambridge.She is currently listed as staff on the website of Cambridge University’s Synthetic Biology Interdisciplinary Research Centre.Contacted by MailOnline, Mr Main said he would have to discuss the matter with his wife, but added: “Not that we’re ashamed of what we said in any way.”Dr Brunker did not respond to a request for comment via the University of Cambridge made by this newspaper.

The country is set to return to Plan A from January 26 in a move described by the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, as a major milestone.  readers reviewed how these restrictions altered their day-to-day lives. Elsewhere, our readers were also discussing the BBC after Nadine Dorries declared an end to the licence fee, prompting the corporation to accuse Ms Dorries of plunging the broadcaster into a spiral of decline.  readers debated where the BBC had gone wrong in recent years as they suggested new ways of funding it.Read on to find out what our readers had to say about these stories and the week\u0027s biggest talking points.The Prime Minister’s announcement means that work-from-home guidance, the requirement to wear face masks and the use of Covid passports in some settings will be dropped.  readers expressed their delight in the reduction of restrictions, however, others felt that some of the policies still needed to be refined or dropped entirely. After talking to friends and family in America, Canada and all over Europe, here in the UK we have actually had it far easier on restrictions than anyone, apart from Sweden.Yes, our first lockdown lasted too long and the third far too long. But honestly, since July, including the December walk back, Boris has actually been the most liberty-oriented leader in the West. Now, I don\u0027t think we should ever have had a lockdown and I was fuming at his rush to return to restrictions in December, but, he is pulling them and doing so early and probably while Keir Starmer and Labour were just about to set up the rules for the non-compliant.These restrictions have not made a jot of difference to Covid, but the collateral damage to the economy, and those with chronic conditions including, but not limited to cancer and heart disease, has been absolutely enormous.Lockdowns and other ineffectual measures will be shown to have been one of the most damaging episodes in the history of this nation.Removing the mask mandate is welcome but the impact is superficial. Whilst we test a large number of people every day, large numbers of asymptomatic people and those with colds will still face a five-day lockdown, which most will convert into a week off work (or longer). As omicron (like delta) will infect the same person multiple times, the real current issue (staffing levels driving overtime costs and delays) will continue for weeks if not months yet.There needs to be a refined policy where those with minor symptoms or asymptomatic positive tests aren\u0027t quarantined or there needs to be a great reduction in the level of mass testing. Otherwise, nothing will practically change.Along with this declaration, Ms Dorries took to Twitter to state that the next announcement about the licence fee will be the last. This claim was reaffirmed days later, as the Culture Secretary confirmed plans to freeze the licence fee for the next two years. Our readers took to the comments section to share what they believe the future holds for the broadcaster. Well done Nadine Dorries, the BBC should not be supported by tax, they also reneged on the 75+ free licence they agreed to.If the BBC is worth it, people will support it. Netflix and other streamers are doing very well.The BBC should support itself by subscription. The fact that they have survived and grown lazy and biased is the obvious reason, maybe they can change, but if not - let the market forces buy bits of them.Do we want to end up like the USA? All TV stations are partisan and rarely provide any news that can reasonably be termed world news. When I worked in Washington DC, the only proper news channel was provided by the BBC and it only aired for 30 minutes at breakfast time.Whilst I find some BBC interviews to be ludicrously biased, I think they can be biased to both political persuasions. On the whole, they provide an excellent news service and an outstanding World Service.We should be very careful what we do regarding the BBC licence fee, lest we get to the US standard of reporting where no one trusts anyone\u0027s account.True, the BBC needs to stop being so woke, but on the whole they do some good stuff.I grew up with the BBC, but now it reflects so little of anything I value. It has morphed into something very different to what it once was. So many of their programmes seem to be fronted by people to whom I simply cannot relate. Comedy is just not funny anymore, emphasis on issues I couldn\u0027t care less about and a feeling of being patronised by presenters whose opinions I do not share.It all feels as if an ideology is being imposed on us and I really resent that. I do not need to be told what I should be thinking, I want honest and open debate.I\u0027m not sorry to see it go but sad that we have lost something that used to represent Britain as I knew it years ago.The guidance states that the NHS will begin the process of firing employees in just over two weeks, meaning that frontline workers who wish to keep their jobs must have their first dose administered by February 3. Readers took to the comments to discuss how this new rule could cause a cataclysmic collapse for the NHS. Not a clever decision from this Government.If I am admitted to hospital I will not care whether those who care for me are vaccinated or not. I am vaccinated. I have had Covid. I am very aware that both the vaccinated and unvaccinated can be vectors.What is infuriating is that many of those refusing to vaccinate were heroes last year. Many have already had Covid. Now this Government makes them pariahs! This action is ethically wrong, it is not based on science and the lack of staff will likely cause more deaths than it prevents.Many unvaccinated people say they won’t get the jab as they don\u0027t trust the ingredients as it is untested, yet when they are hospitalised with it they are happy to have their lives saved by newly developed drugs and never complain about the ingredients in those, I am therefore so surprised that NHS staff continue to refuse vaccinations when they see these outcomes on a daily basis around them with patients whose lives they have to save.The NHS tell us they’re at breaking point already, this is suicide. Expect absenteeism to double. The pressure on those who continue to work for the NHS will become immense. This is self-inflicted nonsense that will harm patients and staff.I’d rather be treated by someone who is unvaccinated than by nobody. How could anyone think this is a good idea? This irresponsible policy must be reversed to stop victimising NHS professionals who’ve chosen another path that’s right for them and in order to protect us all from deliberately sabotaging further an already disintegrating NHS.Civil Servant Sue Gray, who is overseeing the partygate investigation, interrogated Boris Johnson over the alleged parties this week - as new signs of a Conservative grassroots backlash emerged. Our readers responded to this news with their damning verdicts on how this latest scandal has altered their feelings towards the Government. Just shows how Boris thought the rules didn\u0027t apply to him. Maybe you could get away with one party but not 12-13 parties. That just shows your judgement is so wrong by having parties when the normal person couldn\u0027t.Now Boris is trying to save his own skin by sacking other people instead of taking responsibility, it just shows how far out of reality he is. He should do the right thing and quit as he’s lost the trust of the majority of the public.Four out of ten grassroots Conservatives do not approve of our Boris, but six out of ten do approve of Boris. Considering the pressure he is under, he is still a winner and no matter what we still expect great things from this Tory Government.A drinking culture? Is that what they have pulled from this? It could be fizzy water that was served. Alcohol isn\u0027t the issue. Entitlement and an admission that lockdowns were always useless and were meaningless window dressing to make it look like the Government was getting tough on Covid-19 is the headline.Find out who  readers think should be the next Prime MinisterAccording to a stark new think tank report, the state pension age must rise much faster than currently planned and millions of workers should be forced to wait longer until retirement.  readers took to the comments to debate whether they think the state pension age should be raised to 70 or not. Absolutely not, you cannot expect a builder to be working when they are 69. It also needs to be linked to life expectancy in your area. It is wrong that someone who can only expect to live until they are 74 can\u0027t get their pension until they are 70.Furthermore, looking at the rest of Europe, the Spanish pension is very generous. The Italian government is actually looking at lowering the pension age. French pensioners receive far more than UK pensioners.Modern medicines and medical techniques are keeping people alive for longer and therefore in more continuous receipt of state pension and NHS services.The money that such iniduals paid into the system during their working lives will have been used up in the earlier stages of their retirement. So who is going to pay for the difference? Either raise taxes or raise the pension age. We can\u0027t have it both ways.If this is passed, it will really finish off the Conservatives for a very long time. The National Insurance tax hike backlash will be nothing compared to the anger that this will generate. I’m already retired so it won’t affect me, but I worry for everyone else. Very many people get serious health conditions in their 60s and many will drop before they even reach 70, or have poor health so that they can\u0027t enjoy retirement. Even if you’re in relatively good health, there is a slowing down and less energy. Companies will have to bear the burden of older people off work for operations and health issues. Even if you’re well yourself, your partner might well not be, in which case your own retirement is ruined as you become the carer.Find out what current stories are getting our readers talking by visiting the  Community Hub.More from NewsBabes in the Wood killer Russell Bishop diesCovid latest news: Get back to work in the office, business minister saysPolitics latest news: Liz Truss pledges 100pc support for Boris Johnson despite rumours of leadership ambitionsUkraine standoff: US and Russia meet in Geneva for last-ditch talks as invasion fears growOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tearful adele postpones las vegas residence due covid","story":"Adele has postponed the start of her Las Vegas residency, which was due to begin on Friday, because the show has been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and coronavirus.The award-winning singer said she and her production team had tried absolutely everything to pull the show together in time but that it had been impossible.In an emotional post on social media announcing the last-minute decision, Adele apologised to fans and promised that dates would be rescheduled.Disappointed fans took to social media to express their anger after some had spent thousands of pounds travelling to the concert, while resale tickets were listed at more than £20,000. One called the decision a slap in the face.Adele said: I\u0027m so sorry but my show ain\u0027t ready. We\u0027ve tried absolutely everything that we can to pull it together in time and for it to be good enough for you but we\u0027ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid.Half my team are down with Covid, they still are, and it\u0027s impossible to finish the show. I can\u0027t give you what I have right now and I\u0027m gutted and I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s so last minute.The Easy On Me singer said team members had been awake for over 30 hours trying to figure out how to put on the show but they had now run out of time.I\u0027m so upset and I\u0027m really embarrassed and I\u0027m so sorry to everyone who has travelled again. I\u0027m really sorry. Saying she was sorry eight times in a 92-second message, especially for people who had traveled to Las Vegas for the show, Adele said the delays prevented her from perfecting the show to her standards and she promised to reschedule.We\u0027re on it right now we\u0027re going to reschedule all the dates and I\u0027m going to finish my show and I\u0027m going to get it to where it needs to be.It\u0027s been impossible, we\u0027ve been up against so much and it just ain\u0027t ready. I\u0027m really sorry.Tickets for the shows – which were due to take place every weekend until April – ranged from £60 to £500 and were Adele\u0027s first live concerts in five years.Some fans now face losing hundreds of pounds from flights and hotel reservations.Gillian Rowland-Kain, who lives in New York, was on a flight to Las Vegas for Friday night\u0027s show when she found out about the postponement via social media.She said: Her lack of notice is astounding. I\u0027m angry and frustrated.I was furious that Adele waited so last minute to make this call. I recognise it\u0027s not a call any artist wants to make but she would\u0027ve known yesterday that the show wouldn\u0027t be ready by tomorrow.She added that the last-minute cancellation felt like a slap in the face.Josh Chavis, who lives in Missouri, told the BBC that his wife Heather paid nearly £1,300 for her hotel and flights for a show this weekend.Mr Chavis said that his wife was disappointed - and even Adele announcing it a few days sooner would have made all the difference in terms of being able to secure refunds or rearrangements.We recognise that things are hard for everyone Mr Chavis said, but this is a huge misstep on the part of both the performer and those responsible for putting the show together.There was also plenty of supportive responses to Adele\u0027s announcement on social media.@ashlovert wrote: \u0027I had tickets to see u tomorrow and it’s fine, health will always come first and specially in times like this, can’t wait for all the shows to get rescheduled cuz I can’t wait to have the best time of my life with you on stage, pls don’t feel guilty, it breaks my heart, I LOVE YOU.\u0027Others made fun of her emotional delivery. \u0027I like  you Adele, but come on,\u0027 wrote @lAndyHwk. \u0027No No need to bawl your eyes out. It\u0027s postponing a few shows. In the grand scheme of everything going on in the world, it\u0027s really not a big deal.\u0027Adele\u0027s residency was due to begin at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace Hotel on January 21.The shows were to follow her latest album 30, which debuted at No 1 in 30 countries in November.Concert residencies in Las Vegas have become a major attraction in the recent years for musicians who do not wish to travel extensively.Celine Dion, Katy Perry, Carrie Underwood, Usher, Barry Manilow and Shania Twain are among the top acts to have recently scheduled multiple concert dates in Las Vegas.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Liz Truss pledges 100pc support for Boris Johnson despite rumours of leadership ambitionsCovid latest news: Get back to work in the office, business minister saysUkraine standoff: US and Russia meet in Geneva for last-ditch talks as invasion fears growOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsCovid restrictions after Plan B: From face mask rules ending, to travel and self-isolation changesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz constituency does tory defector christian","story":"In the week where David Davis told Boris Johnson in the name of God, go! and Conservative MP Christian Wakeford defected to the Labour party, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.The BBC were involved in a war of words Nadine Dorries after she confirmed the licence fee will be frozen for how many years?Also this week, which Cabinet minister cut short an interview when asked if he gave his unequivocal backing to Boris Johnson?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

The Health Secretary defended comparing the virus to flu despite over , UK deaths, saying it would become endemic in future thanks to vaccination and better treatment. He said Brits would “probably” need annual vaccinations against Covid like against flu. But he insisted he plans to axe mandatory isolation for infected people from March  - with a final decision on the date “in the next few weeks”.It comes as England’s Plan B work-from-home guidance - along with face masks in school classrooms - have both been axed as of today. From next Thursday England will also axe mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs, mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport, and face masks in communal areas of schools.The government has also vowed to scrap free lateral flow tests in future, with a leaked document suggesting this will happen from the end of June. But Mr Javid also said he would choose to wear a mask in a supermarket or on the London Underground, with guidance continuing to recommend them in enclosed spaces. And one exception is Mr Javid still plans to press ahead with plans to force frontline NHS staff to be vaccinated as a “condition of deployment” from April .Asked by Sky Newshe meant to compare Covid to flu, Mr Javid replied: “Yes”. He said: “If at the start of covid when we had no vaccines, we had no testing infrastructure, we had no treatments, people were comparing it to flu - that would’ve been wrong.” But he added: “We need to learn to live with it. Sadly people die of flu as well. In a bad flu year, you can sadly lose about , lives. “But we don’t shut down our entire country and put in place lots of restrictions to deal with it. We need to continue with our lives with sensible, appropriate and proportionate measures.  “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. We have good advice. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be. He added: “Covid is not going away. It’s going to be with us for many many years, perhaps forever, and we have to learn to live with it.”Yesterday Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that the remaining Plan B rules in England would be allowed to expire on January  as the peak of the Omicron wave appeared to be over.The under-fire Prime Minister suggested the country was shting towards living with Covid - like flu - as he battled to save his premiership.  The PM told MPs: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we donapost place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Mr Johnson also told MPs the Government now intended to set out its long-term strategy for living with Covid- , adding: Explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances, especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives.But to make that possible we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. There are still over , people in hospital in England alone. The pandemic is not over.

Work from home guidance has been axed in England and children were allowed to take off their masks in classrooms today as experts said the Omicron wave had peaked.Next Thursday, Covid passes are no longer needed and face coverings will no longer be mandatory in indoor public spaces in England, including on public transport.  Self-isolation laws for infected people are due to expire in March - and could be axed sooner. But there were growing fears lting measures could trigger a resurgence in the highly-transmissible iant. Latest data today showed another , infections and  deaths. Union leaders believe easing curbs could backfire - and TV doctor Hilary Jones agreed.This is a worry to many, many people. Itaposs not just me who thinks itaposs too much too soon,” he told ITV ’s Good Morning Britain. “Teachers, NHS providers, the Royal College of Nursing, Unison - theyaposre all very concerned that taking away all restrictions suddenly, despite the data, is too much too soon.So what rules are being scrapped, when - and what will stay  Here’s a full run-down.Rules that are set to be scrapped January : Working from home guidance endsSince December  people were urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. But that was axed immediately in an announcement by Boris Johnson on Wednesday  January. The guidance, which was not legally binding, was a key way of getting cases down. But officials admitted it had “immediate costs to the economy”. “People should speak to their employers about arrangements for ing to the office,” the Department of Health said. There is still “working safely guidance” about how to keep Covid cases down, including ventilation and regular cleaning. January : Masks in classrooms axedEnglandaposs secondary schools had told students and staff to wear face masks in the classroom since January . Those rules have been axed as of today, with masks in communal areas continuing to be recommended for another week.Week of January : Covid travel tests could be axed for the vaccinatedVaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But Transport SecretaryGrant Shappsis looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.Any announcement is likely in the week of January , the Mirror understands. Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad. January : Compulsory masks scrapped in all settingsFace masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. All those laws will be axed at .am on Thursday  January. At the same time, so will guidance on wearing masks in school corridors and halls. But wearing a mask will still be recommended in some settings, evenit’s not legally binding.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: I think it will be sensible on the tube in London, for example - quite an enclosed space. People will be asked to make their own personal judgment just as we do in fighting flu.January : Covid passes axed for nightclubsSince December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January and will not be renewed. Covid passes can still be used by nightclubs voluntarily but this appears unlikely to be widespread.Boris Johnsonwould likely have needed to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could have been be fatal.Date not known: Definition of fully-jabbed will include a boosterThe government has repeatedly said it will update the definition of fully-jabbed to include a booster in England. While this will no longer matter for domestic Covid passes , it will matter for whether you isolate when entering the UK. Scotland already made this change for its Covid passes on January , for anyone whose second dose was at least four months ago. England has been holding out on announcing a date, because so many people had Covid over Christmas. The infections meant they were unable to get a vaccine for  days afterwards. Date not known: Daily testing for Covid contacts could be cutThe self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this week to at least five full days in England.Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, you still need to take a daily lateral flow test forsevendays .The government has said it will review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too - but has not given a date for a change.March  : Isolation for positive Covid cases scrappedBoris Johnson has announced he “very much expects” to scrap legally-binding isolation for all Covid-positive people from March . This will be a massive change, and end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive for the virus. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the dates are not final but an announcement could be made “in the next few weeks”. Boris Johnson told MPs: “As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. The self-isolation regulations expire on th March, at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards.Spring : Shutting down PCR testing centresLocal Covid testing centres will start to be shut down from the spring, according to The Times. Since the multi-billion pound Test and Trace programme was set up, a huge network of testing centres has ballooned in places like car parks. The average person in England travels just . miles to get a test. Ministers reportedly accept this cannot be sustained long-term, with a source telling The Times: “The wind-down will be quite swt and will mean fewer test centres because we donapost need all of the sites.”End of June : Free lateral flow tests scrappedThe government made clear in autumn  that at some point, free mass lateral flow tests would end and people would start having to pay. Now a leaked document has suggested officials have pencilled in a date of the end of June, after it was put back from Spring amid an outcry. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Lateral flow tests remain free to use and we continue to encourage people to access them. “At a later stage the Government, as our response to the virus evolves, universal free provision of things like lateral flow tests will end and we will update once we are in that position. Thereaposs been no decision made on when that will be.”Rules that are set to stay Guidance on masks and testingDespite most laws being axed in England, there is likely to still be guidance on keeping yourself and vulnerable relatives safe. This can include keeping rooms well-ventilated, meeting outdoors where possible and taking a lateral flow test before you go. The government added: “Public health guidance will remain in place, suggesting iniduals should continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with people you do not normally meet.”Compulsory vaccines for NHS and care staff Covid vaccines will be made mandatory for all frontlineNHSstaff in England from April  as a “condition of deployment”.It is already a condition of deployment in care homes despite fears of mass staff shortages, which have prompted a relaxation of immigration rules. The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’. A government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption. But Mr Javid said NHS staff already need vaccines against other illnesses and it will protect patients.Regular booster vaccinesScientists have repeatedly said there will be an annual booster programme for Covid, either for the whole population or just the vulnerable. Sajid Javid said: “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be.”Keeping powers in reserveJust because legal powers are axed, it does not mean they won’t be brought back. The government has the power to lay Covid restrictions at any time under public health laws dating back to .

Several potential defectors are being wooed by the party in the aftermath of Christian Wakeford’s bombshell switch, it is understood.Sources warned against any imminent defection - but one suggested there could be a breakthrough in future. The source said the door is always open, adding: “I’m not expecting an imminent second one - but that doesn’t mean there won’t be one. “We’ll have to see what happens over the next few weeks.”  The PM’s position temporarily stabilised following Mr Wakeford’s dramatic decision, with claims some no-confidence letters had been withdrawn. Backbench MP Andrew Percy said Mr Wakeford’s defection had “kind of made people a bit more relaxed, itaposs calmed nerves”. He added: “I think people have recognised that actually this constant navel gazing and internal debating is only to the advantage of our political opponents. “The Prime Minister is probably thanking Christian for what he did because itaposs made a lot of people think again, think twice.But Mr Wakeford was in talks with Labour for months, pre-dating Partygate after he privately voiced concerns about the direction of the government.And today’s Tory unity may just be a stay of execution as No braces for next week’s make-or-break investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray.Senior Tory William Wragg, who has already called for Mr Johnson to quit, today accused government figures of aposblackmailapos to persuade MPs to stay loyal.  Veteran Tories could seal Mr Johnson’s fate next week after the report is published. Insiders fear it will not fully clear the PM. Itaposs not going to be as good as people think,” a Government source told the Times. “Sheaposs genuinely struggling to reconcile the Prime Ministeraposs claim that this was a work event with what sheaposs been hearing from other people. “Itaposs very dficult for her. One Labour source said: “There are obviously a number of people on the Tory benches who are feeling uncomfortable with their current position, and reflecting on whether they’re in the right.“It’s a massive show of confidence in the Labour Party that someone who’s been in the Conservative Party can see this is a party serious about government.”But they warned against any imminent new defections and said: “Other people have expressed dissatisfaction with where they are but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll cross the floor - it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do that.”  A second source said: “I don’t think there’s any imminently because it’s such a big political thing. “The first one is the hardest - no one doing it for  years creates a kind of aura about it that’s quite hard to break. But it’s a big thing to do regardless... I’m not aware of anyone whose headspace is ‘I’m in the wrong party’.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid desperately tried to shore up the PM, saying he thought Mr Johnson was secure in his post - despite calls from some Tory MPs for him to resign over Downing Street lockdown parties.Askedthe PM was safe in his job, Mr Javid said: Yes, I think he is. At the same time, people are right to be angered and pained about what they have seen and they have heard. I share that anger and pain. “I think it is right that there is a proper investigation going on that will establish the facts and that the Prime Minister will come back to Parliament and properly respond. Mr Javid called for Mr Wakeford to trigger a by-election in his Bury South seat.  Mr Javid admitted David Davisaposs call for the PM to quit was damaging for Mr Johnson.The former Brexit Secretary quoted from the  Norway Debate when he urged Mr Johnson to stand aside, telling him In the name of God, go.Mr Javid conceded: It is damaging, of course it is. The Health Secretary also said thatMr Johnson was found to have broken the law he would have to go. The Ministerial Code is very clear. If any minister from the Prime Minister down breaks the law, of course they shouldnapost continue to serve as a minister, he said. What I have just said is a general rule that applies to everyone. There is no exception to that rule. He admitted the scandal had damaged UK democracy. If there were people at the heart of government who were not following the rules, absolutely they should be disciplined and I look forward to seeing that disciplinary action taking place, he said. We do now know there were some parties. We know that because some of the people that were involved and broke the rules have come forward to say so. Of course things like this damage our democracy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyDavid DavisBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Stunned mum Kelly Grfiths said her son Louis ended up with teeth in his nose after the water at the pool was turned off. Grim photos show the treatment the schoolboy had to go through to get his smile back. Kelly told Wales Online there was blood everywhere and Louis had to be rushed to hospital.

Louis was operated on there at the dental surgery and had his teeth repositioned and splinted, all whilst he was awake. Kelly said: They gave him five injections of local anaesthetic and they cut his gum open and pulled the teeth back down and had them positioned by the splint. I think he was just in shock, in this country he would have been put to sleep. The holiday was ruined after that, and we were only on day two. We just wanted to come home.Louis couldnapost do anything, he couldnapost eat or drink properly and he couldnapost go in the pool.

Dr Mohan said: “The pictures of Louis have been inspirational to show other children who have suffered a trauma that you can come through it.It helps their parents as well. The worst can happen, and you can still come out with a beautul smile. Kelly said she couldnapost thank the dental team enough for helping Louis get his smile back.

Andrew Watts, , had one of the longest hospital stays doctors had ever seen after spending eight months in intensive care followed by another two months on a ward.The dad-of-two spent  days at Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he was admitted with Covid- pneumonia on Christmas Day in .In February, after a five-week induced coma and two le-threatening lung collapses, doctors called Mr Wattsapos we Hayley to discuss switching off his ventilator because his condition had deteriorated so badly.But the family insisted he should be given more time and he has since left hospital - and now he has come off a nasal cannula for the first time, reports My London.Mr Watts, from Bexley in South London, was finally able to go home in October and said he is doing well but still battles with ongoing complications.  The cab driver, who was in remission from lymph cancer at the time, had to relearn how to walk and talk after spending so long on a ventilator. In intensive care, he used a tracheostomy pipe and had to communicate with his we using letters on a board. Only a week and a half ago, I came off a nasal cannula for the first time since leaving hospital, Mr Watts said. I used it for nine hours every night to aid my recovery to help my lungs get back to some sort of normality. The cabbie told how he has not healed properly after the ventilator and tube was in his neck for so long in hospital. Thataposs why there is a whistle when Iaposm talking as there is essentially a hole in my neck where air comes out, he added.  I canapost get water in it or it makes me cough like mad. I could get an infection which means I canapost go swimming and I canapost shower the way I want to. Mr Wattsapos family, including Hayley and sons Jack, six, and Joshua, three, have all supported his recovery. In November, Mr Watts said his major goal was to walk his sons to school and he can currently walk for up to  minutes walking before his legs start burning. I managed to get to my son’s school and back last Monday. I say that - we parked around the corner, so it wasnapost the full way. But still, he said. I think people should be grateful that they can do these little tasks. Day-to-day, when youaposre fit and healthy, you just do these things and donapost think about.  But when it got taken away from me, it made me realise not to take it for granted. When Mr Watts first went into hospital in December , he had not been vaccinated, due to the very early stage of the vaccination campaign - but he has since had three doses of a Covid vaccine. Looking back on his experience, which included doctors at one time calling his family to tell them they were considering turning his ventilator off, Mr Watts urged others to get vaccinated. When in hospital, he recalled how they did not believe that vaccinations would do anything and that the whole pandemic was a conspiracy. “The fact that there are people that know what Iaposve been through and still say that, he said. Itaposs up to iniduals. If it was me, I would tell them to go and get it. If they decide not to get it, then that’s their own fault. Andrew said he was badly impacted by the virus because he was in remission from lymph cancer after successful chemotherapy treatment. It comes as the Prime Minister today announced the end of Plan B measures - with the onus now falling on the British public to mitigate the risks of Covid. Mr Watts welcomes the change, despite still being clinically vulnerable. He said I want everyone to live their lives to the max, this isnapost going anywhere we’ve got to learn to live with it. “I could wrap myself in cotton wool and live in a box but then whataposs the point in living  I want the world to get back” “Itaposs unlikely I would get it again.

Unfortunately, her cataracts mean she can no longer see very well, but she was still tremendously happy to meet Maeva. Gwen’s family said: “It was a very special occasion to get all five generations together, particularly during the pandemic. Strict protocols are still in place but the home’s manager, Chris, permitted the visit for which we are all extremely grateful.” Gwen was born in Essex on February , , and moved to Gravesend as a youngster, attending school in Northfleet.

But thanks to the staff at the Dene Holm Road care home, Gwen’s family were able to come and visit her together, to introduce her to baby Maeva.

There was only one toilet to use and no hot food. Despite the inadequate conditions, John praised the staff for trying their best and being so caring, reports the BBC.He said: The staff did a fantastic job and they worked really hard and theyaposre so caring, but they were under real pressure as well. There was a sense of helplessness from the staff to the point where they had to just manage their way through a horric situation, caring for people in this way. Iaposd always believed that the health service was thereI needed it. Cardf and Vale health board said it was in touch with Mr Evans and sincerely apologised.  In a statement, the board said: Our services are under extreme pressure due to a number of factors including current staff shortages and the sustained challenges coronavirus presents.In addition, health and social care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are experiencing signicant and sustained pressures which is impacting the timely discharge of patients from hospital.

Last July, Harry was reportedly chased by a pack of photographers after he attended a charity event with sick children at Kew Gardens, west London.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The -year-old had flown back briefly from LA for the July  unveiling of the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial statue. The Sussexes have their own security in the US, but sources said the privately paid-for team have no authority whatsoever in the UK.And one royal source has now told Page Six : “If Harry goes, he will want to have security for him and his family. If and when he decides to go back to the UK, he needs security.” The couple have not announced any official travel plans for  as yet but it has been widely believed they would attend the service in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh who died last April at the age of . This would be the first time Lilbet would meet her paternal side of her family as Meghan has not ed to the UK since the couple officially quit royal le in March  and lost their taxpayer-funded police protection. The Mirror has contacted the Sussexes for a comment.  On Saturday, Harryaposs legal representatives said that he has filed a claim for judicial review because he wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. He has argued that his private protection team in the US does not have the necessary jurisdiction abroad, or access to UK intelligence that is needed to keep his family safe.In a statement to PA news agency, the legal representative for the Duke said: “The UK will always be Prince Harry ’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. “With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. “In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.” The legal representative added: “Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.  “While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.” The bid for a judicial review was filed in September. Dai Davies, former head of Scotland Yard’s royal protection unit, told the Mirror: If ever there was a proper credible threat to Prince Harry or his family then the Met would take the appropriate action. “If he or his family were toto Britain in an official capacity or to support the Queen during the Platinum Jubilee events I’m sure he would be afforded the necessary protection. “I would argue robustly against his case that he is not safe in the UK. If ever the British intelligence services did discover a threat to him and his family they are hardly going to sit on it. It appears that Harry is creating scenarios that do not exist.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Annie Webster, , wired £,. to her then-partner Shawn OaposMalley, who was on the run from police following the shooting in Bolton. OaposMalley, from Warrington, was wanted by police in relation to a shooting in Bolton on September , , when a house was sprayed with bullets. He was jailed for  years at Liverpool Crown Court in September, after being convicted for the attack which he organised on behalf of Warrington criminal Leon Cullen.His prison sentence also related to the torture of two men at a remote cannabis farm, where he tied, beat and threatenedthem with weapons including a pickaxe and sledgehammer, the Liverpool Echo reports. In July, Bolton Crown Court heard how OaposMalleyaposs partner Webster sent thousands of pounds to him while he was on the run in Dubai in relation to a gangland shooting. When police visited Websteraposs home in January  she told them she had split from OaposMalley in November  and was no longer in contact with him. On March , , police executed a warrant at Websteraposs home in Warrington, when she was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. During a search of her house police recovered a number of items including a Western Union Money Transfer Document in her name, an Emirates Economy Boarding Pass in her name and a receipt voucher for a Dubai-based law firm. From a storage area under the stairs in her home, police found a money transfer receipt for £. dated February , , a Ghaya Brand Hotel luggage claim ticket, a money transfer receipt dated February , , and her passport. Following a police search and interview, Webster pleaded guilty to concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property. A charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice will also lay on file. Webster, of Cumberland Street, Warrington, was sentenced to a two-year community order with a -day rehabilitation activity requirement at Bolton Crown Court back in July last year.  But she appeared back in Liverpool Crown Court today where she admitted breaching the terms of her community order. Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, told the court Webster has so far completed five days of the rehabilitation activity requirement since the community order was imposed last summer. However, the -year-old failed to attend two planned appointments with probation in September and November . Websteraposs defence barrister, Kate Morley, told the court her client suffers with anxiety and depression and finds it easier to engage on the telephone as opposed to leaving her home to attend office appointments at times. Ms Morley said Webster had missed the appointments in September and November due to childcare issues with her six-year-old son, who was unwell and has had to have six teeth removed.The court heard Webster also had to self-isolate after her mum tested positive for Covid- until she received a negative test result.Ms Morley said while her client should have picked up the phone and informed probation of this she didnapost and she apologises for that.  The court heard Webster is now working in a local bar and hasnapost committed any other offences. Ms Morley said: She has attended today despite her father sadly suffering a heart attack and passing away last week. Sentencing, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said: Iaposm quite sure that when you were sentenced to this community order back in June last year you would have been told what would happenyou failed to comply with it, so here you are now because of that. The judge said that while he had the power to revoke Websteraposs community order and resentence her to imprisonment, he was not going to do that on the grounds that this is her first conviction and first breach, and because she has a six-year-old son. However, he warned thatWebster continues not to meet the requirements of the community order she will be brought back to court to face the consequences. Webster was handed a fine of £ which must be paid over the next six months.

Another incident claimed a toddler was left to sit with dried faeces on his leg and another child was trapped in the toilet crying and shaking, according to the file. The horrying message said they wouldnapost be surprisedOfsted donapost turn up by the end of the week at the centre in Enderby, Leicestershire.But it was quickly taken down and was replaced with a notice attempting to reassure parents it had been posted in error by a member of staff at the firmaposs head office, reports Leicestershire Live.The biggest issue to emerge from the post referred to an incident last July when a child almost wandered out of the nursery and into the car park via a gate that had supposedly been left open by a staff member. It told how the staff member reported the incident to the then-manager and deputy manager. However the incident was not reported to the totaposs family, the head office or Ofsted, the company told the publication.  The company said the head office was only made aware of the incident in early January and that it had contacted the childaposs parents to inform them of what had happened. It added that an investigation into several incidents is currently underway with a new management team now running the nursery. Staff also acknowledged that workers did not whistle-blow to superiors after realising the management had not reported the incident however employees have since retrained to report such issues in future. The letter also detailed how a pre-school boy was trapped in the toilet for some time, leaving them visibly shaking and crying when let out. It claimed that the incident happened when a staff member was told to close the door to the bathroom to stop children running in and out and did not check the cubicles to seeany children were still left inside. Welcome Nurseries said the door was accidentally closed while the child was inside but staff then realised and ed to let him out. Other issues reported in the accidental post included a staff member wiping babiesapos bottoms with antibacterial wipes instead of wet wipes, causing the babies to have sore and bleeding bottoms. Meanwhile a cook was left to supervise pre-school children alone with no qualications to do so, it claimed. A child in soiled nappy was left unattended for so long that faeces was stuck to his leg and took  minutes to remove. One parent, whose child attends the nursery, said: The entire post is very worrying but my child attends the nursery section so I am particularly concerned that a member of staff was using antibacterial wipes on the babiesapos bottoms. I definitely havenapost been told about it and only found out due to the letter. We have to provide our own baby wipes so there was literally no excuse for them to use anything , they are completely dferent. They have covered staff mistakes up and we wouldnapost have known about itthe letter wasnapost posted. The nursery was already unreliable generally before this and had caused some concern, but hearing about a child escaping in the summer makes me worry , as a parent, will I find outmy child has been put at risk  Itaposs just a lot to hide. If theyaposd spoken with parents immediately at the time, there would have been some angry people, sure, but itaposs a lot better than keeping it a secret. The parent is looking to move their child to an alternative nursery in the near future. They added: The trust is gone with them. Iaposm having to move them to another nursery, which is a big disruption for a developing child, but itaposs something Iaposm having to do to ensure they are safe. Welcome Nurseries confirmed the management in charge of Smarties Nursery has changed since the incidents in question, and that the company was tackling the situation as a matter or urgency. The spokesperson said: We can confirm that we received an email of concern on the th January regarding alleged incidents that took place around July last year, under previous management. We can also confirm that we had no prior knowledge of the incidents until the email was sent to us. The safety and well-being of all our children are our number one priority and we immediately carried out a full investigation. It was alleged that a child managed to escape from the nursery into the car park. Whilst this allegation was unfounded, on investigation it was found that a gate was left open which was seen on CCTV by the receptionist, who acted immediately before the child went out of the gate. We also investigated further incidents which occurred around the same time in which a child was left in the bathroom on their own. Our investigation found that a child had entered the bathroom area and a member of staff not knowing he was there closed the door. Both incidents were reported to the previous management team who are no longer with the company, however these were not reported onward or investigated at the time. These incidents fall well below our standard of care and we have since retrained our staff. We are continuing to work with our parents and can assure all parents that we take all concerns seriously and act on them. We profusely apologise to all our children and parents that these incidents occurred and that we were not made aware of them sooner. We have not yet finished our investigations in this matter. We have a new management structure in place at the setting. We would also like to thank our parents for their continued support. A Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said: “We have very recently been made aware of concerns raised by a parent and will be working with the setting to ensure the appropriate procedures and policies are in place.

Head of Prince Andrew High School, Craig Campbell, in Nova Scotia sent an email to families explaining the name change - branding the decision exciting news. The email explained: The name of a school should be reflective of our school community and uphold our values as a safe and inclusive learning space for all. “Our hope is to continue to build our identity as a positive, supportive and respectful community, with a name to match.” The school was named in honour of the Queenaposs son in  after he was born. However, the name has been a point of concern since  - when Andrew was accused of having sex with an underage girl trafficked by paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein.  Officials in the school originally formed committees in  to discuss a name change after the Duke of York was taken off royal duties as allegations against him began to circulate, despite his denials of any wrongdoing, reports New York Post. One mother of pupils at the school and chair of the school advisory council, Belinda Oxner, said in : As mother-of-three daughters, I find it very dficult to have that name on a building with the allegations and the associations now with the Prince Andrew name. The school will choose a new name in time ready for the new school year in September, the principal said. Mr Campbell added: We’re ready and excited to take this next step. It comes after the Queen stripped Andrew of his royal titles and patronages, meaning he will fight his accuser’s Manhattan lawsuit as a “private citizen.” A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York.  The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Prince Andrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and saw active service in the Falklands War. The royal said he stopped sweating after suffering an overdose of adrenaline while being shot at in the conflict.  The Duke revealed this medical condition in a BBC Newsnight interview when addressing Ms Giuffreaposs description of him sweating profusely. The royal has denied all allegations made against him, including claims he was sweating during a meeting with Ms Gufre. Prince Andrew has lost the following military affiliations:Honorary Air Commodore at RAF Lossiemouth Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm Colonel of the Grenadier Guards – Colonel Colonel in Chief of the Princess Louise Fusiliers of Canada Colonel in Chief of the Queenaposs York RangersColonel in Chief of the Royal Highland FusiliersColonel in Chief of the Royal Irish Regiment , rd and th and The Ulster Defence Regiment Colonel in Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic RegimentColonel in Chief of the Small Arms School Corps Colonel in Chief of the Royal LancersRoyal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland Colonel in Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkBuckingham PalaceRoyal NavyFalklands WarNewsnightEducationRoyal FamilySchoolsArmed forcesSecondary schoolThe Falklands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlotte Briggs, , said she agreed to take on the job that “nobody wanted” six months after starting work at Buckingham Palace in January, . She claimed he was aposdemanding and entitledapos while swearing at her when he wanted a task done and that he behaved like a aposspoiled brat.apos On leaving open a gap in the curtains he said: “Can’t you f***ing do anything right,” claimed Ms Briggs.The mum of two from Halax told The Sun that Andrew kept  teddy bears, many in sailor outfits and also had his ex-we Sarah Ferguson’s wedding dress. Due to offensive behaviour, she said she would even try to hide to avoid him, including behind the big heavy curtains. Her claims come after Andrew was stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages by the Queen. He will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness.The action was taken after a judge decided he would have to face a civil trial on sex abuse allegations made by Virginia Giuffre.The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. Ms Briggs told the outlet when she started working for him, Andrew was  and had just orced Fergie while also a veteran of the Falklands War.  She said: “This man fought for his country in the Falklands but couldn’t stand up to close his own curtains. It was utterly ridiculous but spoke volumes about him. Andrew definitely put a downer on things. He thinks he’s above everyone.” Ms Briggs told how she had moved from Yorkshire for the job and Andrew was based on the “nursery floor” where he and his siblings had grown up. She said that despite being an adult he wouldn’t do anything for himself. “There were two of us and we worked on a rota from .am to .am and then later on in the evening. We’d turn down his bed, remove his teddies, do the curtains and lay out his pyjamas. But he was a bad apple and behaved like a spoiled brat, she claimed. “Really you weren’t actually meant to be seen, you’d just sneak in and do stuff. But he was a bit lazy and he would call down from his office and say, ‘can you send the maid to shut the curtains’. They were literally behind him and massive — from floor to ceiling and as high as a house but he refused to get up and close them himself. She said that it was frustrating as she couldnapost say anything and being only -years-old she would cry about what was happening. Ms Briggs claimed he was worse than ladies-in-waiting who would get up and do some things for themselves. But she added the other royals like Charles and Edward were lovely.

Watchdog Which  says their exposé suggests possible discrimination and a breach of UK law.Which  asked almost  mystery shoppers to create real profiles and note the prices quoted by Tinder Plus, a premium package . The premium package features perks such as unlimited Likes and Rewinds and the ability to undo accidental selections. The research showed some gay and lesbian users were paying more, with an average premium of more than %compared to bisexual users, and more than %compared to heterosexual users.Do you use Tinder  Join the discussion in the comment section This trend was driven by the youngest age group, with Which  finding that gay and lesbian people aged  to  paid £. on average - % more than heterosexual users aged under and % more than bisexual users under  . When it came to age, those in the  to -year-old age bracket paid % more - a £ dference - and the over s paid % more - a £. dference - on average for a -month Tinder Plus subscription. Across the entire mystery shopping exercise, quotes for a yearaposs access to Tinder Plus ranged from £. to £., with  dferent prices quoted in total. The watchdog said Tinder did not make clear the full extent of how it applied personalised pricing on the app, with no explanation to customers that their personal data could be exploited in this way.  Which  said it had reported its findings to the Equality and Human Rights Commissionand the Information Commissioneraposs Officeand called on them to investigate whether there had been a breach of UK law. The Equality Act  makes it unlawful to charge people of one sexual orientation more than others unless there is a clear justication for this. Tinder said it was categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference. It told Which  that older people did have to pay more in some countries, but said the price dference was a discount for younger users. Which  said this was not made clear to people using the app. The consumer group noted that it was occasionally justiable under UK law to offer age-based price iations for the same product or service, such as discounts to over-s or students, where it can be shown there is a legitimate basis for this. However, it said that in the case of Tinder it was unclear as to why over-s were paying more. Tinderaposs terms of use and privacy policy did not make users aware of such vastly dferent pricing, instead referring only to processing inidualsapos data to deliver and improve its services, to help keep users safe and to provide them with advertising that may be of interest. Tinder is owned by the Texas-based Match Group and made US . billion in global revenue in . Which  director of policy and advocacy, Rocio Concha, said: Our research uncovered concerning evidence that people using Tinder could unknowingly be facing higher charges because of their sexual orientation and age. This suggests possible unlawful price discrimination, whether or not it is intentional on Tinderaposs part, and potentially unlawful processing of personal data. We are calling for the EHRC and the ICO to investigate this issue further. If regulators decide that Tinderaposs personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action. A Tinder spokeswoman told Which : Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience. However, we do offer a iety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently.  Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members. In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can y based on factors like location orof subscription. No other demographic information is considered in our pricing structure. The spokeswoman added: It is categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference. Any reporting or inference is patently  and outrageous. There are no truths to the Which  mystery shopping activity. An EHRC spokeswoman said: As Britainaposs equality regulator it is our job to protect, uphold and enforce equality laws. We take reports of discrimination very seriously. This report of potential discrimination by Tinder is concerning. We will consider these findings by Which  and respond in due course.

She had slipped on rocks metres from the waterfall edge then disappeared from view, leaving boyfriend James certain she was dead.The cycling helmet Cara was wearing probably saved her le at Coed-y-Brenin,Snowdonia, North Wales.The pharmacist, , who was on holiday, said: “I remember James shouting to be careful as I fell. “I was sliding all over the place and tried to grab some moss to stop myself but it just ripped off. “The edge was behind me so I didn’t realise I was about to fall until I saw the clf go past me.”  James said it was a miracle she had her helmet on, adding: “I thought there was no way she’d survive.” Rescuers winched her out of the ravine before flying her to Royal Stoke University Hospital. Cara, from Liverpool, had several operations and spent two months learning to walk again before being discharged in November. The emergency response will feature in Channel ’s : Critical Condition tonight.

It is the first in Tennessee to challenge a new law that allows religious adoption agencies to deny service to families whose religious or moral beliefs do not match the provideraposs, their attorney told Knox News.Gabriel and Elizabeth realised they could not have biological children of their own last year and later found a child in Florida who they were excited to foster with plans to adopt, the publication added. They claim they were first told by Holston that the organisation would assist them with their out-of-state placement. But on the day they were due to begin training, they were told it only helped families who shared their Christian beliefs and the couple were unable to complete the fostering process, according to the lawsuit.  Elizabeth said: “I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. It was the first time I felt discriminated against because I am Jewish. It was very shocking and it was very hurtful that the agency seemed to think that a child would be better off in state custody than with a loving family like us.” The Rutan-Rams are currently fostering and hope to adopt a teenage girl through a separate agency with hopes of adopting again in the future, according to the US publication. Holston recently acknowledged receiving public money to offer foster care placement and training for the Tennessee Department of Child Services. It came when it sued the Biden administration last December over new federal regulations. The measures stopped government-funded health and human services programmes from discriminating due to religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, sex or same-sex marriage status. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Child Services and the Tennessee Attorney Generalaposs offices declined to comment on the pending litigation. Alex Luchenitser, associate vice president and associate legal director at Americans United, issued a statement on behalf of the Rutan-Ram family. It read: The Tennessee Constitution, like the US Constitution, promises religious freedom and equality for everyone. Tennessee is reneging on that promise by allowing a taxpayer-funded agency to discriminate against Liz and Gabe Rutan-Ram because they are Jews.

A written agreement had been drawn up between them, he said. The belongings in question include a notebook found close to Laundrieaposs body, but Mr Bertolino declined to reveal which family would be keeping it. A probe into Gabbyaposs murder is still ongoing. Earlier this month an investigation found Utah police officers involved in the case made unintentional mistakes, recommending they were placed on probation.  The probe is looking at the police response into allegations of domestic violence against Laundrie. Laundrieaposs body was discovered at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Florida on October . The -year-old disappeared after ing from a cross-country road trip without his partner Gabby and was the lone suspect in her death. Her body had been found in a remote area in Wyoming on September , and a post-mortem confirmed she had been strangled.  A backpack and notepad belonging to Laundrie was found near his body and although the corpse had been scavenged by alligators and wild pigs, an examination of dental records proved conclusively that it was him. The Laundrie family’s attorney Steve Bertolino said in a statement to E! News: Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide. Chris and Roberta are still mourning the loss of their son and are hopeful that these findings bring closure to both families. Gabby and Laundrie embarked on their trip in early July from New Yorkaposs Long Island, where her parents live. As they travelled through Kansas, Colorado, Utah and points west, Miss Petito documented their van le on social media.She posted her final photo to Instagram on August , the same day she last spoke to her mum by phone.They were seen quarrelling in August, with police in Utah releasing a video showing Miss Petito tearfully describing a dispute she had had with Laundrie.

One -year-old son has unfortunatley witnessed just that recently - and to make matters worse, the incredibly awkward moment was caught on camera. Joseph Pena had been away from his family in Colorado, USA, for the last two years completing military service in Germany.Heaposd decided to try and surprise his parents with a visit home and showed up unnanounced, giving his mum and dad a much bigger surprise than heaposd bargained for.His mum Kaati,  and dad Richard, , were aposcaught in the actapos as Joseph barged into their room without knocking first.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The couple refer to what their son saw as them apostalkingapos as this is the codeword they used for sex when the kids were little. Their very intimate aposdiscussionapos understandably left Joseph mortied and unable to face his parents for a while. Mum Kaati recalls: We were surprised and beyond embarrassed. My husband and I were talking, which was our code word for sex when the kids were little, and we were in the moment when the door got kicked open. I screamed because I saw my son and of course realised he saw everything exposed. She continued to say: We had no clue that our son Joseph was coming home on his RR and he told his sister Josephine, the camera lady, that he wanted to surprise us.The online responses have been epic! The comments are on fire and most are roasting our son for not knocking. To this day it’s still being viewed, and comments are still pouring in.Our poor son was scarred during his RR and spent most of his time with his sister and his girlfriend. The mum added that Joseph then aposavoidedapos coming over to their house for the remainder of his down time, instead opting to text and call his parents. We were okay with it because he needed to enjoy his RR and not be scarred by what he saw. I’m sure he’s trying his best to erase the visual memory of the incident, but living with us will only remind him of how Eve and Adam conceived the whole world.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

American blogger and mum, Alexis often shares videos of her travels, useful tips and destination recommendations on TikTok, where sheaposs known as @worldtraveladventurers. But in a recent video, that has been viewed more than , times, she sparked a debate about travel etiquette as she asked what the right age is for kids to be allowed in upper classes on planes. Do you think kids should be allowed to fly business class  she captioned the post. The video shows her two children, Ellie and Christophe, flying first class on a number of trips.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. If parents can buy them a seat in business class, then they have the right to be there, she says in the video. We do think itaposs important though, for parents to teach kids to have proper behaviour on flights. Alexis explains that they didnapost travel in premium cabins until her kids were at least four years old because at that age, they had more self-control and could manage their behaviour better. Flying in business class gives her kids the freedom to lie down, sleep, play games and watch films - and the other passengers rarely even know theyaposre there. She posed the controversial question to TikTok users, who were keen to give their opinion. Since being posted, the video has racked up almost , likes and  comments from ided viewers, with some saying they shouldnapost be allowed.One person said: Absolutely not. They should create a childrenaposs suite. Another added: I think Iaposd be madI saw them.

His visitation rights have been suspended until February, unless the dad gets vaccinated before then. The judgement came after the dad had requested an extra day with his child over the holiday period, according to local reports in Quebec, Canada.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The mum contested the request after learning from his social media posts that he was not vaccinated. She further requested a suspension of his visitation rights, claiming he would be a conspirator and anti-vaccine. The child has received both their jabs, but the mum lives with her partner and other children under the age of five who are not yet able to get vaccinated. The judge said: In these circumstances, it is not in the best interests of any of the three children that Monsieur can exercise access toat this time.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.This is not the first reported case of a parent being denied visitation for not having their Covid- vaccine. In New York, a dad was banned from visiting his daughter unless he becomes double-jabbed or agrees to weekly Covid tests. The ruling was made by a New York City orce judge, who suspended the parentaposs visitation rights to see the three-year-old girl until he agrees to either option. Matthew Cooper, who is presiding over the estranged coupleaposs orce and custody dispute, wrote in his ruling: “Here, in-person parental access by the defendant is not in the child’s best interests, and there are exceptional circumstances that support its suspension. “The dangers of voluntarily remaining unvaccinated during access with a child while the Covid- virus remains a threat to children’s health and safety cannot be understated. “Unfortunately, and to my mind, incomprehensibly, a sizeable minority, seizing upon misinformation, conspiracy theories, and muddled notions of ‘inidual liberty,’ have refused all entreaties to be vaccinated.” The ruling requires the unnamed dad to either get the jab or present a weekly PCR test in addition to a biweekly antigen test within  hours of a scheduled visit. He currently visits his daughter every other weekend. The judge wrote that the couple split in  and the proceedings have been contentious with the two wrangling over custody of their daughter. The child resides mostly with her mother in Manhattan, where she attends preschool.

Members of SAS E Squadron will lead a rescueRussian troops and armour pour deep into Ukraine.As many as , Russian combat forces are now amassed close to Ukraine’s border - including ground troops and amphibious attack personnel.More are pouring into neighbouring Belarus, putting Ukraine’s capital Kiev at riskPresident Vladimir Putin orders a full-scale invasion.Moscow’s commanders have ordered large amounts of multi-launch rocket systems to be transported into Belarus, which could be used as a launch point for an invasion. American President Joe Biden has already warned he believes an attack is “imminent” and bungled by hinting an American response depends on the severity of an incursion.Many observers believe full-scale invasion is unlikely butthat takes place British Foreign Office officials may be rescued by special forces. It is believed crack UK special forces may also be placed strategically within Ukraine acting as military advisers, along with US counterparts.  One security source told the Daily Mirror: “British intelligence is watching developments all over Ukraine but in particular in Crimea, which is occupied by Russian forces. “All of the other manoeuvres may have been a ruse to deflect from Crimea and Putin may want to expand it towards contested Donbas.”Tonight the UK Ministry of Defence told the Daily Mirror: We do not comment on special forces. Ukraine’s troops along a -mile trench border through Donbas, in Donestk and Luhansk, are on high alert for an attack by Moscow’s forces. They are preparing to launch a guerrilla warfare against attacking Russian soldiersthey roll over the frontline, using UK-supplied shoulder-launched NLAW missiles. They have pitted crossing points with anti-tank mines and other defences, preparing to retreat and then launch counter-attacks against an invasion force. Experts warned Russia will act quickly and decisivelyit invades. aposRussia to act quickly and decisively in invasion of Ukraineapos Hugo Crosthwaite, lead analyst for Eurasia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly, said the Russian plan was to get concessions on Ukrainian NATO membership and Donbas. Putin is keen to stop Ukraine from becoming a NATO member but the US has insisted on making no promise. Moscow also wants pro-Russian separatist occupied Donbas to be officially part of Russia and some experts believe sanction threats will not deter the Kremlin. He said: “A Russian invasion of Ukraine is a likely scenario in the coming weeks. “There have been several military and diplomatic developments that point to a sustained severe interstate conflict risk, including Russian troops deploying to Belarus and further efforts by the Kremlin to create a pretext for an attack.  “The combined efforts of the US, the EU and NATO to deter Russia in recent months appear to have failed. “Even the sanctions the US has threatened seem to have had little impact, with Russia having effectively sanction-proofed its economy. “Russia’s military build-up means it can now begin a ground operation or launch a devastating missile and artillery attack at little to no notice. “Rhetoric from the Kremlin has become more belligerent, including unevidenced accusations that the US is training ‘anti-Russia’ units and Ukraine is preparing to attack separatist forces in Donbas - a tactic the Kremlin used in  to justy its annexation of Crimea. “We still doubt that Russian forces would attack Kyiv, either via ground assault or air and missiles, and assess that Russia’s main goal in any military operation would be to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to resign quickly, and offer wide-ranging concessions from NATO membership to the status of Donbas.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoEuropean UnionForeign OfficeMinistry of DefenceJoe BidenVladimir PutinSoldiersSpecial forcesUkraine crisisRussiaDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But now Navalnyaposs team claim to have found thousands of actual photographs of the palace confirming a “striptease” room known as a “hookah” with a stage and a performer’s pole. The striptease hall, hookah, call it what you want, really exists,” says a commentary with a video on the new pictures. “And it looks much worse than we could imagine.”  A computer-generated image shows how the Navalny team had imagined the pole-dancing boudoir a year ago based on leaked plans which also included a casino and aqua disco. A photograph shows what they claim is the striptease room reality in the palace when it was still under construction. “The stage is littered with pillows,” said the commentary.  A pulsating light appears above and behind where the dancer would perform. “We donapost even know how to describe it. A portal  A silhouette of a temple dome ” Other images show the Russian leaderaposs bedroom, a second bedroom and his office, as well as a swimming pool, they claim. The double-headed eagle symbol of Russia is found throughout the palace, appearing to give it an official seal. Amid controversy over the palace stoked by Putin enemy Navalny, a year ago oligarch Arkady Rotenberg denied it belonged to the President and said he owned the sprawling clftop property overlooking the Black Sea. Billionaire Rotenberg is Putin’s former judo sparring partner and perhaps closest friend from childhood. At the time the tycoon explained: “This is a stunning place. We would like to build an apart-hotel there, this is why it has so many rooms.” He told the media without going into detail that he had managed to “become a beneficiary” of the well-guarded property.  The high-security palace reportedly includes a “-storey underground complex” compared with the lair of a James Bond villain. It was also described as “a whole anthill in the rock under the house”. An engineer-turned-whistleblower who reportedly worked on the construction - named only as Viktor - thought of the palace as a “national treasure” suggesting the underground passageways buried in the rock were more ingenious than Dr No’s bunker. The palace designs included on the eighth subterranean floor a balcony - literally a loggia hanging over the sea built into the clf, from which the owner can enjoy wine tasting from the palace stocks, he said. It is, however, far from clear that Putin has ever lived here and a year ago it appeared to be undergoing reconstruction. The Kremlin has denied that it is the President’s private home. Lawyer, anti-corruption campaigner and protest leader Navalny - seen as Putin’s number one enemy - is in jail but is seen in the West as a political prisoner.

We were observed to have less than one per cent discards and, of that, only a point of a percentage was cod.#There#s really nothing scientic behind this, it#s all political.#The CFA was due to meet with Cabinet Secretary Mairi Gougeon yesterdayafternoon.Tommy told the Courier he would be pushing for a -month delay on the complete ban to allow a proper scientic assessment of stocks to be carried out.He said: #It may be that when that#s complete, we won#t have a case – it might be quite clear that the area needs to be closed to everybody and,so, we#ll accept that,it#s based on proper scientic evidence.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 21 2022","story":"Energy company ScottishPower has won the rights to develop plans for its first fixed offshore windfarm in Scottish waters – off the west coast of Islay – as part of Crown Estate Scotland#s ScotWind Leasing, announced on Monday .ScottishPower says the GW MachairWind project will make a #signicant contribution# to tackling the climate emergency and achieving net zero, with the potential to generate enough clean electricity to power more than . million homes.#ScottishPower has been working with people, communities and businesses across Argyll and Bute for more than  years now, as we#ve built our onshore wind portfolio,# said Keith Anderson, the company#s chief executive officer.#So, it#s really exciting to be expanding into offshore wind in a region where we#re known as a responsible developer and a good neighbour.#Offshore wind is set to become the backbone of the UK#s energy mix and will do the heavy lting as we ramp up the production of clean electricity on the journey to net zero.#Our Islay project will play an important part in that and make the best use of the region#s fantastic natural resources to help power the UK#s transition from fossil fuels to renewables and a better future, quicker.#It will also help deliver investment, support jobs and boost supply chains – opening up immense opportunities for businesses and institutions across the region and the country – which can register their interest on our online portal now.#The announcement was welcomed by development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise , which believes the economic impact of the offshore wind industry in the Highlands and Islands could be similar to that of the oil and gas sectors.#We believe the economic impacts of the offshore wind industry will be along similar lines to what we saw  or so years ago with oil and gas developments,# said Stuart Black, HIE#s chief executive, #and will help to create the conditions for a just transition for both the Highlands and Islands, and the climate.#We can expect many new, highly skilled offshore wind-related jobs to be created in some of our more rural and island communities.#Visit www.machairwind for more information on the MachairWind project, including a registration area for potential supply chain partners.A multi-million pound Scottish Water investment on Islay is now onstream after a marathon journey across land and sea and months of on-site testing.A Transportable Treatment Unitis now connected to the network supplying nearly , customers in the Bowmore and Port Ellen areas.Georgina Reid, Scottish Water#s corporate affairs regional manager, said: #The new unit is now supplying an additional , litres of clear, fresh drinking water a day.#This £. million investment is just part of our ongoing programme of works for Islay to provide capacity for future housing developments but also resilience and improvements to the existing network.#The new TTU was transported under police escort more than  miles from Ross-shire Engineering#s specialist factory in Muir of Ord, where it was built and partially commissioned off-site.The unit provides capacity for an additional , litres, boosting the , litres already supplied from the existing Torra Water Treatment Works on the island.As part of the installation of the TTU, a new pipe bridge across the River Torra has been constructed to support a short section of the two kilometres – around . miles – of new raw water main that has also been installed north of the water treatment works.Scottish Water is also currently embarking on a £ million water network improvement project in Bowmore, where nearly four miles of water mains on streets across the town will be replaced over the next  months."},{"url":null,"title":"home win sees pupils under 17s top league table","story":"Campbeltown Pupils# under s sit proudly at the top of Glasgow and District Youth Football League Division One after an excellent - win at home on Sunday to an impressive Rossvale Thistle.The Ardshiel Hotel-sponsored Pupils started on the front foot and were unlucky not to take the lead in early exchanges thanks to a number of fine saves by Moore in goal for Rossvale.With  minutes gone, the Pupils got the breakthrough.

It keeps its failures off the front pages.A new year and the catastrophes mount up for the SNP Green alliance. An out of touch and too cautious Covid policy, pupils frightened to go back to the classrooms, the Ferguson shipyard in even more disarray, AE waiting times at an all-time low, retail businesses losing huge sums of money, underfunded local councils being forced to cut services, all while it raises taxes and does not even have the common sense to put off expensive new fire alarm regulations for hard-pressed homeowners. Constantly blaming Westminster is a convenient distraction for now, but these failures and others will not be forgotten come the May council elections.Defending a record like this on the doorstep will be rather dficult, especially since breaking up the UK does not provide convincing answers.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.SEND FOR MORDAUNTIF, or should that be when, Boris Johnson eventually steps down, I hope that the Tories select Penny Mordaunt as their new leader.

A classic example is Scotland Matters, which failed to disclose the London benefactor who contributed £, towards its anti-SNP campaign in the run-up to last year’s Scottish elections.The growing rise of the London think-tank industry and the numerous right-wing think-tanks which fail to reveal who funds them while acting as lobbyists and anonymous front bodies poses a far greater threat to democracy than the rare cases of voter fraud.The Elections Bill seems to be more about disenfranchising some voters than tackling the more important issues, including preventing overseas electors donating to political parties or referendum campaigns.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.KIEV DOES NOT DESERVE SUPPORTSOME media commentators appear to be excited about the prospect of a war over Ukraine, asit would be some video game and not a crisis that in the worst-case scenario could turn into a nuclear confrontation . And the political classes view the crisis as being a useful deflection from their economic and social problems at home. Meanwhile analysis of the origins of the crisis lacks any statesmanlike response, and is replaced by the knee-jerk reaction of sending arms to the regime in Kiev.And it is a regime that rules in Kiev, having come to power in a coup supported by the US and EU, when the pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine won an election. Since then Kiev has been underwritten politically as well as economically and militarily by the West, which at the same time expresses outrage at Russia giving similar support to the breakaway forces in the predominantly-Russian eastern Ukraine. Russian military manoeuvres in Belarus are a provocation, but Nato military manoeuvres in Poland apparently are not so. Sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander it would appear.Meanwhile the regime in Kiev, as corrupt as all its predecessors since independence from the USSR, has been eroding the rights of the Russian-speaking minority still under its control, limiting the use of Russian in political le and in education. More to the point, some present-day Ukrainian nationalists are following in the footsteps of their anti-Semitic forebears by erecting monuments to those who cooperated with the SS in the mass extermination of Jews, Communists and others during the Second World War. Back then, these Ukranian nationalists also fought alongside the German Wehrmacht and against the Red Army, which, no one now seems to recall, was the ally of Britain of that time.Instead of playing dangerous war games around a fictitious \"gallant little Ukraine\",there are any statesmen around, rather than political adventurists, they should be calling for new elections, internationally supervised, in the whole of the Ukraine, with the Russian-speaking east having full devolved rights in a federal state solution. Should that not be possible then the right of the eastern Ukraine to secede from the country should be recognised.The Russians in eastern Ukraine have as much right, should they choose, to secede as has any other national group which chooses to do so.Ian R Mitchell, Glasgow.Read more: End the lie that Boris Johnson has saved the UK from Covid"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12198988.jpg?type=article-full","title":"american-airlines-flight-38-miami-london-returns-face-mask-drama","story":"The American Airlines flight from Miami, Florida to London was about , feet over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening when the incident occurred.The passenger, who the New York Times describes as a woman in her s, was escorted off the plane and dealt with “administratively” by the airline’s staff who were waiting with police at the gate.Laura Masvidal, a spokeswoman with American Airlines, stated Thursday the passenger was added to the airlines internal refuse list pending further investigation.Police said they did not arrest her, and no one was injured.Local TV station WFOR-TV claims that the more than  passengers on the plane were not notied about why it had to turn back to Miami.A passenger told them: \"We werent given any instructions, just told that we had to go back and now we cant get our luggage.”Another passenger said: \"Disappointed.

Trading s can operate in numerous ways, but the most common is to simply match buy and sell orders between iniduals, often executing the transaction at the current market price. While some trading s will charge fees for facilitating these transactions, some of the best in the business don’t. A prime example of such a  is eToro. In fact, you can sign up with eToro within minutes should you wish. With this said, there are other, more specic factors relating to trading s too. These sites let you complete transactions in both fiat currency and through crypto pairs, their feesare typically much lower than other investment s, and they all have certain trading tools readily available. Examples of these would be trading charts, access to market history, and a running order book . All of these tools are there to help you make the most informed decisions possible when trading. gtgtgt Trade with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider How Do Trading Platforms Work You can think of trading s as a middle man, helping investors to make crypto trades on either side of the equation - buying or selling. Trading s often use the current market price for all crypto coins, although users don’t necessarily have to trade at the current market price. Should traders set up any stop orders, engage in CFD or derivatives trading, or take part in leverage trading, the current market price has less importance. But regardless of which product or service you use, trading s are fundamentally there to let investors buy and sell cryptos, usually instantly, in a very simple manner.How to Sign Up to a Trading PlatformUnless a site lets you trade cryptos without setting up an account, you will be required to register to gain access to their products and services. With that said, evenyou can trade without registering, we’d recommend that you do open a new account to avoid any restrictions further down the line. Most trading s have a similar registration process these days, which is why we can give you a fairly accurate rundown of the sign-up process right here. gtgtgt Open an account with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerHow to Choose the Best Trading PlatformIt would be easy to simply list some trading s and proclaim them to be the best in the business. But once you’ve read through some of the key areas below, we are sure that you will feel much more confident regarding what to look for in a top trading site.Design and Ease of UseWhile it is important to pick a trading  that has good quality products and services, the actual user experience is equally as important. After all, you could sign up with the most extensive trading  available, butyou have a hard time using the site, you won’t feel like it’s worth it. That’s why we like to source s that have simple navigation systems, user-friendly designs, and self-explanatory tools to keep everything as simple as possible. If all of this is available through both a desktop and mobile  - even better! Trading OptionsThe great thing about crypto trading is that it can be done in so many dferent ways. Evenyou initially sign up with a site with the intention of standard trading, you just never know whether you will get a taste for other trading products. With that said,you never have access to alternative products, to begin with, you certainly won’t discover dferent ways of trading. Therefore, picking sites that have a iety of trading options is always going to be beneficial. Fees and CommissionsWe’ve all been the victim of using sites that seem to have an extortionate and somewhat unfair system of fees charged to customers. With trading s, customers can incur fees when making deposits, processing trades, requesting withdrawals, and sometimes - fees can be charged for nothing at all, known as inactivity fees. Needless to say, getting charged such fees can leave a bitter taste in the mouth. ReputationThe days of finding trading s with some fairly obvious red flags are long gone. But this can be both a blessing and a curse. Since most s now have no real indicators to suggest that you should steer well clear, doing your research has become even more critical before joining any site. When we say ‘doing your research’, what we really mean is that you must check out a s reputation prior to jumping in with both feet. One of the best ways to do this is to look at current and previous customer reviews, and also to look at trustworthy comparison sites - although these can be a bit of a diamond dozen.Minimum Investment RequiredEducational ResourcesEducational resources are usually handed out free of charge at the top trading s. These can come in two main forms too - access to recent crypto news and actual resources explaining how dferent trading products work. For example, some sites have educational videos on leverage or CFD trading, as these can be more complex than other activities. And some sites will also have resources that you can view or read to learn about inidual crypto coins projects. This is often linked in with recent crypto news, and you can even get rewarded for checking out such resources - as seen with sites such as Coinbase. gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsTrading s can feel quite complexyou are brand new to them.

But before we wrap this up, we’d like to leave you with a couple of reminders. Firstly, crypto trading is highly volatile, meaning the market can take drastic swings in either direction. This can have a huge impact on your holdings. Secondly, dferent trading products carry dferent levels of risk, and you should never trade using a product you don’t fully understand. Finally, don’t be afraid to do your homework and use the educational resources at your chosen site.The more trading knowledge you gather, the better your investment decisions will be, and the more likely it is that you will turn a profit in the long run.  gtgtgtto eToro now ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider FAQsAre trading s regulated Yes - trading s are regulated in their inidual countries of operation.

I have to be honest, I thought it was a unique appointment at the time.“I was surprised and shocked Rafa wanted to go and have a go at that job, with his legacy and his relationship with Liverpool.“It hasn’t worked out for whatever reason, you have to be inside the club to know why and what’s gone on.

Any form of blackmail and intimidation of that kind simply has no place in British politics.“We need to get to the bottom of the matter. But I find it very unlikely that these allegations are true.” vw,vw,px, px\"Conservative MP William Wragg The Business Secretary said Mr Wakeford’s “very serious” allegation has so far been “unsubstantiated”.“I’m sure it will be investigatedit’s not being so already – after  years as an MP I’ve never heard anything like this,” Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“Having been an MP for  years I’ve never heard of anyone making a threat, certainly not to me or to anybody  of that kind, doesn’t mean it’s not true.”But he also described Mr Wakeford, who was elected to Bury South in  on a wafer-thin majority, of having “essentially turned coat” in switching to Labour.“I don’t know what his motivations were, and as you’ll appreciate he’s a Labour MP now and, of course, part of his job is to try and discredit the Government,” he told Sky News.Mr Kwarteng said he had never experienced bullying from the Government whips.“Generally, my whips were a lot shorter than I was over the years,” he told LBC, adding that therefore “I’m not sure how the physical intimidation or other forms of intimidation” would have been effective.The damaging claims came as Mr Johnson battled to remain in power ahead of the result of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s inquiry into allegations of rule-breaking partying during coronavirus restrictions. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer with Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who has defected from the Conservatives to Labour The result of her investigation is not expected until next week.On Thursday, the Prime Minister said Mr Wragg’s allegation will “of course” be looked into but insisted he has “seen no evidence” to support it.But the Times reported that Tory MPs wanting to oust the Prime Minister are considering publishing a secretly recorded conversation with the chief whip and messages to help support the claims.Mr Wragg is one of a handful of Tory backbenchers to have said publicly they have submitted a letter to the chairman of the backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, calling for a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson’s leadership.Mr Wakeford said he had done the same before he defected to Labour shortly before Prime Minister’s Questions this week.On Thursday, he told BBC North West: “I was threatened that I would not get the school for RadclfeI did not vote in one particular way.

This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia. My own objective was to learn to speak Gaelic, a language I had not heard until I set foot on the island, which in those days was almost entirely Gaelic-speaking.Canna House, where Campbell lived with his we Margaret Fay Shaw, had much  to offer: a well-stocked Celtic library , and just as important, a series of Gaelic and literary visitors, arriving from all over western Europe and North America. Conversations at the dinner table were always lively. MacLellan of South Uist was still living, and though up in years was one of the best ever recorded and well worth visiting. century the Skye ethnographer Martin Martin remarks on the quality of South Uist Gaelic.Campbell had provided letters of introduction to his main Gaelic contacts. Shortly after being warmly welcomed into a very patient household in Loch Eynort, South Uist, I set out for Bornish to call on Agnes Currie, housekeeper to the parish priest, well known for her large repertoire of Uist songs, mouth music, and prayers.’ [Fr Colin MacInnes] of my own age, who was later to receive widespread recognition from his exemplary community work in Ecuador.The following day I found a lt towards Daliburgh to visit the storyteller Angus MacLellan in Frobost.

After our initial conversation she led me out to weed in the garden # her way of ensuring that visitors would remember any lore she provided. When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":null,"title":"stronger messaging urged as ni schools bear the brunt of covid relaxations","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Seeing restrictions eased across society doesn’t mean this it a time to relax,” said Ms O’Shea.“If anything schools are going to have to be stronger, and we would like to see stronger language used by the Executive in their messaging to education.“We‘ve seen before that schools bear the brunt of any wider easing of restrictions. This time it will be no dferent.“Schools need to be ready as we are likely to see another surge in cases over the next two weeks.“It#s not a coincidence that the Department absence figures are showing a slow down at a time when there has been a change in the testing regime. It may look good on paper, but the reality is that schools are still struggling to manage, and that can’t be forgotten. The positive cases amongst pupils and staff and the staff shortages are still a daily factor that schools are having to contend with.”First Minister Paul Givan said the Executive decision was always that restrictions wouldn’t stay in place for a day longer than necessary.“The view is that these restrictions relaxed today are no longer necessary,” he said.“Our parents, our teachers and our students want to be in school. They want to be in university. They want face to face contact with their lecturers and teachers. We’re seeking to provide all the support we can to do that in a safe manner.“We have to make sure the environments are as safe as possible but we do need to keep our children in schools.“One thing that those lockdown measures showed us is the harm that they caused to children in particular, and the impact both academically and psychologically, and unfortunately physical abuse as well. That is a measure none of us want to see repeated in the future.“These are testing times for our principals, for our teaching staff. They have been doing a remarkable job with teaching in classes and trying to deliver online learning for those pupils who haven’t been able to be in school. Closing down our schools is not something I ever want to see happen again.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationThe Executive OfficePaul GivanMore On Department of Education PremiumMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterBill on flexible school starting age to be fast-tracked through Stormont PremiumMark BainOpinionWhy we should measure the value of a school, not the costFewer pupils absent at start of new school term in NI than before ChristmasMost ReadArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest EducationMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health serviceMark BainOpinionWhy we should measure the value of a school, not the cost schools at risk under plan to streamline education in Northern IrelandLatestI should be more intelligent – Thomas Partey takes responsibility for red cardThey are by far the best – Ralph Hasenhuttl believes Man City have title sewn upViewpointOpinionFreedom comes at a price for everyoneBrit Awards announces star-studded line-up of  performersTop US and Russian diplomats hold talks on Ukraine amid ‘critical moment’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Danny LawsonNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMany of us have had to get used to sticking swabs up our noses and down our throats.But recently, the Public Health Agencyreleased nasal-only swab tests to help detect Covid-, especially in asymptomatic iniduals.Read MoreAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxationsIn December, it was announced that post-primary school pupils would only have to swab their nostrils with new ACON Flowflex nose-only tests, which the PHA said would “make regular asymptomatic testing easier”.Traditionally, lateral flow testshave required people to swab both their noses and their throats to testthey have contracted coronavirus.According to Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen’s University in Belfast, “there remains a good deal of research to be done on figuring out what’s going on with the tests and virus in your nose and throat”.He noted “there’s a chance that swabbing your nose versus your throat could give a dferent result when using rapid Covid antigen tests”.“There are several examples on social media of throat swabs showing positivity while nose swabs being negative despite some tests only recommending nose ,” he continued.“Therefore, there’s a chance that nose only could miss people who are likely to be contagious, which is not a good idea when you’re trying to slow down the spread of an infection.”Matt Wills, programme director of the Rapid Testing Team said: “There are now several dferent types of Lateral Flow Devices in use across Northern Ireland. It’s vital that anyone using them closely follows the instructions in their test kits.“All the tests currently in circulation have been proven to accurately detect the new Omicron iant. Both the ACON and Orient Gene tests are nasal only tests, meaning a throat swab is not required.“The result is ready after  minutes but the result may be inaccurateread after  minutes. There are other dferences too so it’s important to read the instructions as you complete the test.”Dr Bamford said “some tests have been validated for nose and throat while others have been validated for nose only”.“During the latest wave of Omicron, which has been very large and when antigen tests have high availability, we have noticed dferences between where you swab. There remains a good deal of research to be done on figuring out what’s going on with the tests and virus in your nose and throat.”The anti-viral immunity expert also believes that “testing will likely have use outside of the clinic for the near future” and said “the success of testing, tracing and isolating is based on accurately finding those who are most infectious”.He added that “the success of our vaccine rollout — including boosters — is likely the source of why the latest Omicron wave hasn’t been as bad as previous waves with regard to people getting really sick and dying”.“It’s likely that through the continuation of vaccination over the next years, we will maintain solid protection against severe disease for most people and most iants. What Covid has taught us though is to not let get complacent and there’s still signicant uncertainty about what the next wave and or iant will look like,” he said.Matt Wills added: “Please keep making safer choices and follow the latest guidance evenyour test result is negative.”Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health serviceIn-person teaching set toat Queen’s University PremiumLisa SmythOpinionIf Omicron goes, we can be cautiously optimisticWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days  PremiumProfessor Colin Harvey: ‘Destructive negativity’ will not derail united Ireland conversationMost ReadTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest CoronavirusAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateAll Covid- rules may be ended in Northern Ireland in  daysStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxationsWhat are the rules going to the pub, will you need a Covid passport and when are nightclubs reopening NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesLatestSteven Gerrard expects Everton reaction after Rafael Benitez sackingJapan widens virus restrictions as Omicron iant surges in citiesCharities and Amazon get together to support needy familiesStranded dog rescued with sausage dangled from drone‘Hearts are broken’ as singer Meat Loaf dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

pub Bittles Bar, John Bittles, was relieved to see the end of Covid- certication, as checking everything from mobile apps to PCR test results had proved to be a dficult task.“It’s January, you have bills to pay, you’ve staff to pay so I think the general consensus is we’re really glad to see it but I think for the sake of a week, they should have lted the Covid passport as well,” said Mr Bittles.General manager of Moira’s Pretty Mary’s, Joe Webb, was glad to see theof dancing in venues as it will allow the Co Down pub to bring back its popular live music evenings.“There was no point in having music on unless people could dance,” said Mr Webb. “Its definitely a very welcome step forward for the industry.”Elsewhere, Belfast’s DJ Tez told Evening Extra that the Executive must

one of her most popular dresses for hire at her Newry shop Willow Designer Dress HireAmy CochraneTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHow many times have you bought an outfit, worn it once, posted it on social media then hid it away in the recesses of your wardrobe only to gather dust and never to see the light of day again More times than enough is the answer for many people as the wave of fast fashion continues to affect both the environment and our finances.It is estimated that the fashion industry accounts for up to % of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.There is, however, a solution which has grown in popularity as the concept of sustainable fashion gains traction - renting dresses for a special occasion.Willow Designer Dress Hire in Newry was established in August  by Cara Heaney, who wanted to help people to refocus their views on buying clothes and help them to make more environmentally-conscious choices, while also looking great in some top designer outfits.The idea for the business came after a wardrobe clear-out shocked her into realising just how many clothes she had worn only once.“I had paid a lot of money for these, but some were long out of date and I just wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing them again, so into the charity bag they went,” said Cara.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This got me thinking that I probably wasn’t the only one with lots of wardrobe space taken up by dresses worn once and I dreaded to think of the amount of money spent on these.“It really was such a waste,” she said.“To be honest I had never thought of hiring dresses before, but something just clicked that it would be a great service to offer.”While Cara said that this is not a new idea, she felt that it was the perfect time to bring this issue of wasted clothing back into the public eye.“The more I researched this, I discovered that there was a gap in the local market for this service but not only for just ordinary dresses, what about really nice high-end labels – the kind you see on the more popular social media influencers,” she said.“When it comes to fashion, the most obvious is to hire occasion-wear which you are only going to wear once or twice maximum.“You would still get that great feeling of wearing a fabulous dress and not being out the money.”Some of the dresses worn by social media influencers, and some which Cara offers to rent, can set you back over £ a piece, but you can rent them on average for about £ for a maximum of four days.Labels stocked at Willow include Self-Portrait, Zimmerman, Nadine Merabi and Rixo as well as Kevan Jon and Nadine Merabi.“Of course, the number one reason why anyone would hire clothes is for financial reasons,” said the Co Down businesswoman.“The price tag on the high end labels that most people aspire to wear is just too hefty for most, howeveryou were to rent that little black dress for your special occasion, you can have access to your favourite designer without racking up the credit card debt.”She said that not only does the idea of hiring clothes make sense financially, but it is also environmentally friendly.“It is an unbelievable fact that with UK households sending , tonnes of fashion waste to landfill every year and the average number of times a garment is worn is dropping by % over the last  years,” she said.Social media, however, she argues, seems to play a part in the continued use of fast fashion labels and the splurging on expensive outfits only to be worn once.“At occasions when people are glammed up, photos are taken, posted on social media and you are put off from wearing it again,” said Cara.“You aren’t going to have the same dress appear three or four times on your page. “With the rise of cheap clothing the impact on the environment is huge as well,” she added.“People generally don’t feel guilty about throwing out a £ vest top out of Primark, whereasthey had an £ top, they would think twice about putting it in the bin!”Cara has hired dresses out to women all over Ireland, from Dublin, Donegal and Galway and even one from Liverpool who was visiting Belfast for the weekend.You can follow the business on Instagram by searching for @willow_designer_dress_hire.Most ReadTributes paid to

Credit: Ariadna De RaadtJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA seasoned observer of Presbyterian Moderatoral elections will notice several important points about this year’s list.All four candidates are ministers in rural areas - from Portrush, Larne, Kilrea and Richhill. Usually there is at least one from the greater Belfast area or the main centres of population.Read MoreNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedSecondly there are no candidates from across the Border, even though every Moderator represents the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.There are lively Presbyteries in the Republic who might be expected to put forward a candidate, but their reluctance to do so may be because the current Moderator, the Rt Revd Dr Bruce, has spent a large part of his career ministering across the border.It is also interesting that only four ministers allowed their names to go forward this year, though there were greater numbers in some years past. This may be a coincidence, or it may be because fewer ministers want to shoulder the challenges of a high public profile which every Moderator faces, and particularly in these years when the PCI is involved in continued controversy about its policy on same-sex issues.Most signicant is the absence of a woman minister on this year’s list. The PCI has been constantly criticised for its failure to elect a female Moderator.Ironically it was the first main Reformed Church in Ireland to ordain a woman minister – the Reverend Ruth Patterson. Since then she stood twice, unsuccessfully, for the Moderatorship and on her second attempt she received not a single vote from any of the  Presbyteries.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More recently the Reverend Dr Elizabeth Hughes, formerly of Whitehouse Presbyterian, was runner-up in the election for Moderator but when she ran again the next year she was down the list.Perhaps women ministers are longer willing to put themselves forward with seemingly so little chance of success.Whatever the reason, it is extraordinary that in this age of gender equality, the PCI is still unable or unwilling to elect a female leader. Sadly, it remains the only major Reformed church in Ireland not to do so.Most ReadTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateJonny Tuffey vows to give Crusaders new-boy Jude Winchester all the support he needsShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last yearWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersLatestSteven Gerrard expects Everton reaction after Rafael Benitez sackingJapan widens virus restrictions as Omicron iant surges in citiesCharities and Amazon get together to support needy familiesStranded dog rescued with sausage dangled from drone‘Hearts are broken’ as singer Meat Loaf dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most people wouldn’t mindthey’re doing exactly the same work as a colleague in an office or a factory, they’re not going to get worried about titles.”He added that he would support Mr Eastwood’s plans to scrap the deputy First Minister title to “take the energy out of it”.The last thing we want on the other side of an Assembly election in May is for the two largest parties to be at each others throats just because of a silly title.”More pressing issues, he said, included tackling a housing crisis, hospital beds and investment west of the River Bann in Northern Ireland.The issue, he said, had also shown “a strategic weakness” in unionism that considered that a unionist vote had more value than a nationalist.Most ReadTributes paid to ‘beautul’ Fionntan McGarveyas PSNI launch murder investigation into fatal assaultArlene Foster thought ‘for most of weekend’ about Cavan teen who took his own le after being bullied because dad was ProtestantNext Presbyterian Moderator: Four ministers in the running revealedNI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen and table service rules scrapped as First Minister says society must get back to ‘normality’NI Covid restrictions: Nightclubs to reopen from Wednesday, table service to be removed and changes to vaccine passport rulesTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateJonny Tuffey vows to give Crusaders new-boy Jude Winchester all the support he needsShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last yearWaterfoot beach and caravan park at risk amid erosion and extreme weather damageBelfast movie will be a big draw, say local cinema ownersLatestSteven Gerrard expects Everton reaction after Rafael Benitez sackingJapan widens virus restrictions as Omicron iant surges in citiesCharities and Amazon get together to support needy familiesStranded dog rescued with sausage dangled from drone‘Hearts are broken’ as singer Meat Loaf dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity to demonstrate a broad consensus on this important issue. It is particularly disappointing that both of Sinn Féin’s South Down MLAs were absent for the vote.Sinn Féin  said: “Sinéad Ennis had to leave for urgent family business the chair was informed in advance.

extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they

Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week. They are also to seek a meeting with planners to outline their case.SAINTFIELD ndash Damage to Saintfieldrsquos century-old floral farm cart at the weekend has infuriated village residents and especially the members of the pioneering Bloom committee.The celebrated cart, laden with polyanthus, pansies and spring flowers, had its shafts broken at the body when it was lted from its perch and ped to the ground before midnight on Saturday.In December it was removed to the side of the Orange Hall and behind locked gates to make space for the Christmas tree.

The competitiveness of the derby resulted in a stalemate by half-time.With chances coming early on into the third quarter, short corners naturally started to follow. lsquoHinch were able to work the ball up through Adam Dodds before passing over to Jason Campbell, who was able to win a short corner for his side.Matthew Martin released his drag flick going just wide of the post.Saintfield were able to keep lsquoHinch at bay until a cross ball from Martin found team-mate Andrew McIlwaine at the back post to opening the scoring.With lsquoHinch looking to keep their lead, they engaged a high press on to the Saintfield defence as they hoped to increase their lead.However, with this high press tactic Saintfield were able to break away past the lsquoHinch defence only to be met at the top of the circle by lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell, who did well to prevent a goal.A super ball from Leslie Harrison to forward Lewis Higginson, allowed the lsquoHinch attacker to run the baseline and win a short corner.Martin took a drag flick only to be stopped by the Saintfield lsquokeeper.Saintfield responded by pushing lsquoHinch into their own circle and winning a short corner.The Saints managed to convert off the short corner to equalise the game in the final quarter.Despite a few more half chances, both sides went home with a share of the spoils..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Magnificent Kilcoo are champs of Ulster again  ","story":"KILCOO are one game away from a place in this yearrsquos All-Ireland Club Championship final.Last Sunday, the Magpies produced a spectacular performance to dismantle Fermanagh champions Derrygonnelly at the Athletic Grounds in a one-sided affair to win by  points.Mickey Moranrsquos men are now red-hot favourites to win the All-Ireland club final after losing out to Galway champions Corofin after extra-time in .But Kilcoo must first overcome St Finbarrrsquos in the semi-final clash at pm on Saturday, January  at OrsquoMoore Park, Portlaoise and will be taking nothing for granted.Last Sunday, goals from Daryl Branagan, Ceilum Doherty and Shealan Johnston contributed to the onslaught in Armagh to secure the Ulster title by a comfortable margin.Paul Devlin enjoyed his afternoon splitting the sticks, with reassurance within the squad stemming all theway from the back through Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, who bossed hisarea and even registered a point of his own.With the pain of the  All-Ireland defeat still hurting, Kilcoo will be looking to right that wrong and taste success.ldquoThe Corofin game really hurt, said Kilcoo star Ryan McEvoy.ldquoAfter playing so well for so long and then just not getting over the line, it hurt.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the wider Catholic school community are extremely concerned at the choice of words used by UUP leader Doug Beattie MLA when he declared the “need to end educational apartheid”.[In a press release last Friday he had declared: “We need to end educational apartheid which is taking place here. We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.”]Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated VS integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘integrated’.There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied, strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities.Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind.Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender.Catholic schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – maintained, controlled, integrated, Irish medium and grammar.However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.– Gerry Campbell is Chief Executive of CCMSMore from the News Letter: Click here: Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers Click here: VIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal status Click here: VIDEO: The most stunning photos of Northern Ireland from the air – as taken by the PSNI helicopter squad over the last year Click here: WATCH: Odd speech by chief NI Protocol negotiator Liz Truss shows her enraged by imported cheese but overjoyed at pork marketsA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Credit : Rob Youngson   Focus FeaturesThe film starts with the jollity of a tight-knit terraced neighbourhood being shattered by a riot intended to intimidate Catholics into moving out.Given the starting point, the threat of violence looms large for the entire film but it is not a well which Branagh taps too often. Instead he celebrates togetherness rather than ision, helped by a stand-out cast including Ciaran Hinds, Judi Dench, Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan.There are bits of dialogue reminiscent of the Derry Girls scene listing the dferences between the two religions that bring a chuckle.For example when Buddy, who doesn’t want to go to church, points out: “But Daddywe were Catholics we could not go to church, then every once in a wee while we could do it and confess. And then they’d have to tell us we were forgiven and we wouldn’t have to go in again for ages.”The film does have a certain feel-good factor which belies its backdrop. Ultimately, it could mean that Branagh’s heartwarming story, aided by an uplting soundtrack from Belfast’s own Van Morrison, is better received internationally rather than locally, where we’ve grown accustomed to expecting the worst to happen.Whether you’re watching the film in Belfast, Beirut or Boston it is hard to find fault in the film’s visual integrity – its wonderful black and white imagery is captivating on the silver screen.The often dark Northern Irish sense of humour is also given a good showcase, like when Buddy is trying to solve a mathematical problem with his granddad who tells him to make his numbers indistinct so his teacher will give him the benefit of the doubt.“But there’s only one right answer,” says Buddy.His Pop replies: “If that were true, son, people wouldn’t be blowing themselves up all across town.”• Belfast opens in the UK on Friday, January , though some special screenings of the film are taking place in Belfast this evening ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s proportionate, it reflects the changing circumstances that we have in respect of Covid, and it is a step in the right direction, and hopefully we will continue to make progress at our meeting on February .”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, she believed Northern Ireland had passed the peak of omicron.She said: “The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic. We believe we are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.“It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet.“I do think after our Executive meeting we hope we will be able to say positive things that will be welcomed by both iniduals and also by the hospitality sector.”The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for Covid- were notied by the Department of Health yesterday.The latest update from the Department shows that a total of , coronavirus fatalities have now been recorded.The figures also show , new infections, with  Covid-positive patients in hospital, and  in intensive care.l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"watch citys oldest picture house the perfect spot to watch kenneth branaghs belfast film ","story":"Perpetrators of Troubles bloodshed are not the ones who matter: their victims are   PSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRANewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleWATCH: City’s oldest picture house the perfect spot to watch Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast filmWhen Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast opens tomorrowin the city where it is set, one cinema can lay claim to being a venue befitting of hosting the movie.By Graeme CousinsWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Thursday, th January , : am  \"       \"  The Strand Cinema on the Holywood Road in east Belfast first opened in  and is the only ‘picture house’ still standing from the time when Belfast is set – the s.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle said: “This is the only original picture house left in Belfast. “The film itself includes a couple of visits to the pictures.

It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Although the film’s UK release date is given as Friday , special screenings will take place in Belfast tomorrow evening before opening across Northern Ireland on Friday. Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast film“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Jude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If regulators decide that Tinder’s personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action.”Tinder respond to discrimination claimsTinder told Which  that it was “categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference”.A Tinder spokeswoman told Which : “Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience.“However, we do offer a iety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently..remove“Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members.“In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can y based on factors like location orof subscription.
