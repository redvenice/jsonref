Yet I had never met him and have never seen a photograph. In the haste with which he and my grandmother were removed from their home in the foothills of Hungary’s Carpathian mountains in June 1944, family snaps were lost.But it was not just Sandor and Fanya who came into my mind on my visits to the death camp. I thought, too, of my uncles, Danny, Ference and Ignatz, who died in work camps after they were taken from their families at the outbreak of war.And I remembered my two aunts and a cousin.          Russian soldiers with liberated inmates at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945Miraculously, they survived the brutality of those who guarded them in Auschwitz, the excruciating hunger pangs and the penetrating cold which made their bones ache in the bleak mid-European winter beneath the flimsy, rough-cotton, concentration camp garb.And there was another uncle, my father’s brother Martin, who emerged from his own odyssey of hell in the camps where he was tortured after his escape attempt was thwarted.The 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, commemorating the moment Russian troops uncovered the horrors that lay within this vast complex in southern Poland, was marked on Thursday at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, Israel’s memorial to the Holocaust. Prince Charles was among more than 40 world leaders to attend.Today, Holocaust Memorial Day — and the actual anniversary of the liberation — will be honoured at Auschwitz itself and in London. But with each passing commemoration, the distance of time reduces the number of those who were witnesses to the atrocities.Members of my own family who were affected have passed on in recent years. My father Michael, who came to Britain as a refugee after the war had broken out, died in 2018.The uncle who survived the camps has also gone. Amazingly, the three other survivors — my father’s two sisters and niece — live on, now in their 90s.         The entrance to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland pictured this monthTheir immense fortitude, the spirit which kept them alive through the worst horrors of the 20th century, remains intact.But for these women, who experienced first-hand the barbarity of the Nazis and their fascist Hungarian collaborators, recent years have not been easy as echoes of the past have returned in the form of anti-Semitism.Here in Britain, this most tolerant of countries, anti-Semitism in the Labour Party dominated headlines during last year’s general election campaign.         Alex Brummer has written about how the holocaust impacted his familyChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis felt the need to caution that the ‘very soul of the nation is at stake’. That did not prevent swastikas being daubed on buildings in the London suburb of Hampstead.Which is why, on this anniversary, it is more important than ever to remind the world where anti-Semitism can lead — because there can be no starker illustration of it than Auschwitz-Birkenau.My grandparents were dairy farmers and life was hard. My grandfather was up before crack of dawn every day to do the milking. But there were relaxing family moments, too.On Sabbath afternoons, in fine weather, he would gather the children around him under the overhanging pear tree in the garden, reading from The Bible and studying with the older boys.In the evenings, he would be joined on the terrace by friends from the village they would drink a little schnapps, tell stories and play cards and draughts.His mother, meanwhile, would busy herself in the kitchen preparing her specialities, including rolled cabbage leaves filled with meat, rice and spices, served with paprika and tomato sauce.         The remains of the barracks and main building at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration campMy father Michael left home at 14 to become apprenticed to a glassworker in Pressburg — now Bratislava in Slovakia. He later trained as a naval officer at a college near Genoa that had been established by Zionists.In 1938, as the grip of Nazi Germany tightened across Europe, my father decided to join his elder brother Philip who was a rabbi near Liverpool. Before he left, he returned to visit his parents in Hungary and was beaten up by fascist thugs when he arrived at the station in his home town close to the Hungarian-Czech border.But he managed to see his family and resolved then to take his younger brother Martin with him. At the crossing into Czechoslovakia, however, Martin was turned back by border guards and my father continued to Britain alone. Six years later, in 1944, Adolf Eichmann, architect of the Final Solution, issued orders for Hungary’s Jews to be rounded up and transported to the death camps.For most of my childhood, the Holocaust was a forbidden subject, only talked about in knowing whispers. But over the years, piece by piece, I have pulled together the story of those family members who entered the gates of Auschwitz.I learned that it was the courage and tenacity of my cousin, Shindy — then a teenager — who helped to keep my two aunts, Rosie and Sussie, alive amid the inhumanity. It was she who bargained for bread and made the deals that ensured their survival in the camp.My father made his way through a Europe already at war and eventually arrived at London’s Victoria station — and, by accident, in the ladies’ waiting room. There, he was befriended by an ‘elegant English lady’ who helped him across the city and put him on a train for Liverpool. From that single act of kindness, he developed a lifelong admiration for British tolerance.         President of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, Holocaust survivors and former prisoners pictured at Auschwitz-Birkenau ahead of the 75th anniversary of its liberationIt was only after the war, in 1947, that my father and his elder brother Philip — both by then settled in Brighton — received a telegram out of the blue from the Swedish Red Cross.It said that they had three young women by the name of Brummer who claimed to have relatives in Britain. Was this so? Could they be returned to the family? Would my father and his brother be willing to pay the passage to the UK?It was a joyous moment. Nothing had been heard of them in the years since the war ended, and it was assumed that they had perished in the gas chambers like my grandparents.Meanwhile, my father’s younger brother Martin had been moved between work camps and death camps. It transpired that, on an attempted escape from one camp, the Nazi guards seized him and tied him down on the railway lines to punish him. They left him there for many hours in the bitter cold and only cut him loose seconds before an approaching locomotive bore down on him.Martin’s survival — he died five years ago in Israel — and those of the three women has always felt like a small victory against the vicious cruelty that cost my grandparents their lives.But still the shadow cast by the Nazis will always fall blackly upon my family, which is why I felt it so important to go to pay my respects at the place where they fell.I have now been twice to that place of death to bear witness, to heed the words of Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Elie Wiesel: ‘Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to life as long as God himself. Never.’         The group are pictured walking around the camp almost 75 years after it was liberated by Russian soldiers when they entered southern PolandOn my first visit in the Nineties, we drove past cultivated fields and white-painted houses with bright orange roofs on the hour-long journey from Krakow airport to Auschwitz.By the time we crossed those infamous railway tracks and saw the most chilling station name in the world, the sky had darkened, with a swirling wind and pelting rain. The horror of what faced us became real, and a dull ache grew in the pit of my stomach.Today, this is not some remote facility it is surrounded by industrial buildings with shops and petrol stations, their architecture blending into that of Auschwitz 1 — the main camp — itself. It is a death camp in suburbia.And yet the smell of burning corpses — which decades later still permeates the nearby crematoria — seems to linger here, too, a horrific reminder of what took place inside the gates with their iron sign that reads ‘Arbeit macht frei’ (Work brings freedom).There is nothing immediately alarming about Auschwitz 1. The reconstructed barracks, surrounded by grass verges and lined with trees, could be mistaken for a housing estate. But at Block 4, there is a quiet, terrible reality.In a stark room, where the smell of chemical preservative takes one by surprise, human hair is piled up like a mountain.Shaved from Jews before they were led to gas chambers, much of the hair is grey now, turned so by time and poor conservation. Yet still I searched for a trace of red — a family trait — as if it could be possible there was a direct link to be found here. We sheltered from the bitter weather next to Block 10. This was a gruesome spot, where Nazi doctor Josef Mengele experimented on women.         A guard tower standing vacant at the edge of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in PolandAnd my mind flashed back to the hushed tones of my childhood: visiting an aunt in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, her health permanently damaged by her time in the camp, after she had given birth to a tiny baby kept alive only by the skills of modern medicine.The physical scars may have healed but the psychological impact has cascaded down the generations. The survivors in my family live with the past every day.My Aunt Rosie lost her sense of smell because of the stench of the camps. The filth she was forced to live with left her with an obsession over cleanliness.When I last spent time with my Uncle Martin (my father’s younger brother), his body began to shudder and he was quickly moved to tears as he remembered his personal torment in a different death camp.And if you set foot in one of these places, even for a few hours, it is easy to understand why survival was truly a life sentence.How could it not be so if you had witnessed monstrosities such as Auschwitz’s ‘Wall of Death’, where thousands of prisoners, having been tried by Gestapo kangaroo courts, were summarily shot and their bodies dragged away on carts to the permanently smouldering funeral pyres. Next to that wall today, barbed wire stands bleakly against the sky.         This aerial image shows the remains of the barracks for prisoners at Auschwitz II - Birkenau camp in December last yearNearby, one can climb down into the only gas chamber not destroyed by the SS as Russian troops approached. Standing under the grates in the ceiling, through which the Zyklon B gas was released on to naked Jewish bodies, tears flowed again down my face. That faint smell of burning, from the crematorium next door, intensified the overwhelming effect.There are rough wooden barracks as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the chimneys of the Nazi death factory. Inside, the roughly hewn wooden bunks, which each held five or six souls, are intact. Seeing them, I recalled the stories of my aunts huddling together for warmth.Grass now grows around the buildings but at the entrances, where our feet sank into the mud and ashes, one could almost smell the fetid stink of human decay.We walked for a mile or so down the side of the railway track that brought in the cattle trucks of Jews, Romanies and political dissidents from every corner of occupied Europe. Journeys of 1,200 miles or more, without food or water, journeys on which the corpses would eventually outnumber the living.I recalled my cousin describing her departure from Hungary: the Jews begging through the cattle-truck openings for water from the Hungarians who had been their childhood friends and neighbours. Instead, they were offered salt.The tragic roll call of the members of my family who perished — my grandparents Sandor and Fanya, my uncles Danny, Ference and Ignatz — must never be erased.And for the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of survivors and refugees, who have enjoyed good lives in Britain, it is fitting that the Duchess of Cornwall, with world leaders and other dignatories, will today share in our grief at Auschwitz, standing shoulder to shoulder with the last survivors in tribute to the million who were brutalised, starved and slaughtered.They — we — will remember them again and weep for a generation that must never be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER asks real Profumo story locked vault","story":"Share this article Lord Denning concluded that there had been no threat to national security and cleared the security services of any involvement in manipulating the outcome of Ward\u0027s trial.Ward himself was in a coma when the jury returned its guilty verdict. He had taken an overdose of sleeping pills the night before, after hearing the judge\u0027s brutal summing-up from the dock in the Old Bailey.He died three days later and a potentially damning testimony about the conduct of leading politicians died with him.At the time, many regarded Denning\u0027s published report — it became a bestseller — as a whitewash. This position gained renewed credibility in 1993, when it was revealed that then Prime Minister John Major had ruled that the materials and documents gathered in the course of preparing the report could not be made public under the usual \u002730-year rule\u0027.          A poster for Stephen Ward: The Musical (pictured) which was written by Andrew Lloyd WebberInstead, the full dossier was to remain under wraps for a further 70 years.It was rumoured that Major was so intrigued, he had asked to see extracts from the full report before agreeing to lock it away. What he read evidently convinced him.Some gossips have drawn scurrilous inferences from the fact that a sketch by Ward of Prince Philip, whom he had treated for a back problem, had made its way to Lord Astor\u0027s country home, Cliveden — where John Profumo first spied Christine swimming naked in the pool.But the impression I get from my own enquiries is that the secrets hidden in Denning\u0027s full report are far more serious than any alleged indiscretions by a member of the Royal Family. After all, the Netflix drama The Crown alluded heavily to Philip\u0027s occasional visits to Cliveden, and the Official Secrets Act was not invoked.When I raised the issue in the House of Lords — I was made a Conservative peer in 1997 — my question was batted away.Afterwards, one or two knowledgeable souls hinted to me that the papers might no longer exist in the National Archives at Kew.They said the report might have been quietly \u0027lost\u0027, just as the transcript of Ward\u0027s trial had been lost.The only possible explanation for such an undemocratic action would be that Denning uncovered something of the utmost gravity.What that could be, we can only speculate — but remember that 1963 was also the year MI6 mole Kim Philby fled to Russia after years of spying for Moscow.         Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, 71, (pictured) continues to ask why the real story of the Profumo affair is still locked in a vaultDuring our conversation, Mandy Rice-Davies simmered with anger at the injustice she felt had been done to Stephen Ward.\u0027He was not a pimp,\u0027 she said. \u0027He just loved people.\u0027Her loyalty was fascinating. She could easily have resented Ward for dragging her into a life of vice.When she met him, she was just 16, a policeman\u0027s daughter who had worked as a glamour model and a dancer in Soho. Ward introduced her to a thuggish landlord named Peter Rachman, who was notorious for renting out his slum tenements to immigrants at extortionate rents.For Mandy\u0027s 17th birthday, Rachman bought her a Jaguar even though she hadn\u0027t yet passed her driving test.This was a world of sleaze which, as a 13-year-old pupil at Westminster School when the Profumo Affair broke, I could not begin to comprehend. But what I, and everyone else in the country, found unbelievable was that girls like Mandy and Christine had been welcomed at Cliveden and some of the grandest homes in England.The man who made that possible was Mandy\u0027s friend and corrupter, Stephen Ward.Over the decades, I often contemplated writing a musical around the Profumo Affair, and every time I came back to the central figure of Ward.He was undeniably charismatic, counting Royals, film stars, peers and spies among his chums.Few who knew him spoke ill of him. Instead, they remarked on how elegantly dressed, how generous, how sweet-natured, how oddly innocent he was. No man in England, it has been said, could wear sunglasses with such raffish charm as Stephen Ward.So I was intrigued when, at a friend\u0027s birthday party, I was introduced to the veteran journalist Tom Mangold with the words: \u0027This is Tom. He was the last man to see Stephen Ward alive.\u0027Tom, a reporter at the Daily Express in 1963, had befriended Ward during his trial.On the evening after the judge\u0027s closing remarks, Tom went to Ward\u0027s flat in Chelsea and found him despondent. If he had stayed over, Ward would probably not have taken the lethal overdose of drugs — but Mangold had to get home that night for family reasons.Mangold\u0027s interest in the story has not abated, incidentally: in a BBC2 documentary broadcast last night, he argued that the full Denning Report remains secret because its author had uncovered details of a long-running and depraved affair between another Cabinet minister — not Profumo — and a prostitute that posed a far greater security risk.But if I was intrigued by meeting Tom, meeting Mandy left me hooked. With the playwright Christopher Hampton and lyricist Don Black, I embarked on turning Ward\u0027s story into a stage spectacular.Some context: I was not a well man at the time, suffering from serious complications after treatment for back pain by (oh, the irony) a highly recommended osteopath. I was spaced out on super-strength painkillers.Looking back, I realise morphine and musicals don\u0027t mix. Large parts of the writing of Stephen Ward: The Musical are a blank to me. I don\u0027t recall how I got to the show\u0027s first night in 2014, for instance.I am proud of many of the songs and truly believe that, although it was deeply flawed, it had the bones of a terrific musical. But it closed after three months, causing me to recall the words of U.S. theatre impresario Jimmy Nederlander Sr, who once told me: \u0027There is no limit to the number of people who won\u0027t buy tickets to a show they don\u0027t want to see.\u0027Perhaps if I\u0027d called it Mandy And Christine: The Musical, it would still be playing to packed houses. Who knows?Mandy Rice-Davies loved the show. Sadly, she died in 2014 from cancer. If Christine Keeler ever came to see the production, she kept it quiet.Stephen Ward desperately wanted to be a fully paid-up member of the Establishment. Yet it was the Establishment that eventually destroyed him, possibly to protect its own.Ward had pleaded with MI5 to let him be an agent, gathering intelligence on his high-society friends. Perhaps, unwittingly, he was on the fringes of a conspiracy that even now could shake this country to its core. I wonder if we will ever know.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna.

No prizes for guessing which one he chose. “I immediately felt like a character in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell – a place where you have to write that white is black and black is white,” he told the Washington Post, confident that every reader would get the gist. Resurgent authoritarianism and online misinformation have conspired to make Orwell’s work aggressively relevant in recent years, just in time for it to fall out of copyright on the 70th anniversary of his death.Then again, when has Nineteen Eighty-Four not been relevant? No work of literary fiction has ever become such a fruitful stockpile of impactful, flexible and easily understood metaphors for the villainies of the modern world. As Anthony Burgess quipped in 1978: “American college students have said, ‘like Nineteen Eighty-Four, man’ when asked not to smoke pot in the classroom or advised gently to do a little reading.” This leaves Richard Bradford, an English professor at Ulster University, somewhat unsure about the case he’s making. “Orwell is a writer for our time because the issues he foregrounded and tackled in his work are timeless,” he says. So is Orwell a writer for our time specifically or for all times? Did he, as Bradford often claims, “foresee” the 21st century or simply describe, brilliantly, problems that are always with us?The publisher’s claim that this is the first “major” biography since Orwell’s centenary in 2003 is itself rather Orwellian. Now that even Orwell’s most robust contemporaries are no longer around to share their memories, every biographer must walk a well-trodden path (Eton, Burma, Paris, Wigan, Spain, London, Jura) in the footsteps of earlier scholars, but there is not an ounce of unfamiliar material here and even the less obvious quotations and anecdotes appear to have been drawn from secondary sources. Vital context is missing. Bradford’s minimal interest in other writers of the period gives the false impression that Orwell was alone in, say, noticing that Stalin and Hitler had much in common, rather than one node in an informal international network of anti-totalitarian socialists. The bibliography is both thin and predictable.Bradford, whose previous subjects include Larkin, Hemingway and two Amises, seems less enthused by the past than by the present and less interested in Orwell’s opinions than his own. Passages that might work in a polemical appreciation are ruinously distracting in a supposed biography. Whenever Orwell himself threatens to swim into focus, another disquisition on the stupidity of Brexit or the ghastliness of Jeremy Corbyn muddies the picture. The reader lurches from Burma to Ukip, and from Down and Out in Paris and London to Channel 4’s Benefits Street, as Bradford press-gangs poor old George into his war against an army of bugbears that includes Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Xi Jinping, Nicolás Maduro, Islamism, Twitter, Eton, Jacques Derrida, EL James, George Monbiot and that notorious Orwellian demagogue Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: “River Cottage is his oligarchy, something he has transformed and improved, and his prole-like neighbours appear suitably grateful.” Well, it’s certainly a fresh angle.Orwell himself was fond of waspish lists, from the savage caricature of crank socialists in The Road to Wigan Pier to the tally of Soviet sympathisers he maintained towards the end of his life, but only in the service of the immense project that dominated his writing life: explaining and opposing totalitarianism. Without an equivalent purpose, Bradford’s book suffers from an acute failure of perspective. The New Statesman’s misquoting of Roger Scruton last year may have been unfortunate but it didn’t quite rise to the level of the Stalinist vilification of Orwell’s colleagues in the Spanish civil war.Overstatement walks hand in hand with anachronism. Though Orwell championed the notion of a united states of Europe, it is self-evidently meaningless to call him “a passionate Remainer long before the EU was conceived of”, because there was no entity in which to remain. Claiming that the “machine-produced trash” in Nineteen Eighty-Four “anticipates” Fifty Shades of Grey implies that pulpy erotic fiction didn’t exist in Orwell’s time, when that was exactly what Orwell was satirising. When Bradford writes, “I would not venture that Orwell anticipated #MeToo, not quite,” one is thankful for small mercies.Bradford’s contrarianism is sometimes enlivening. He admires Orwell’s least popular novel (A Clergyman’s Daughter) and most problematic essay (Inside the Whale) while casting a sceptical eye over his celebrated pamphlet The Lion and the Unicorn. For all Orwell’s memorable insights into the national character, Bradford is right to say that “up to his death he could never quite make up his mind about how he felt about England, except that he could not stop being part of it”. In a way, Bradford’s recognition of Orwell’s eccentricities and paradoxes makes matters worse. How can he then presume to know what this contradictory character would think 117 years after his birth? “One has to ask: if Orwell could rejoin us in 2020 what would he make of it?” I’m not sure one does but Bradford asks anyway. The answer is that he would agree with Richard Bradford.This is a book undone by its own premise. The intent is to use Orwell’s life and work to illuminate the present. Instead, the klieg-light glare of the present reduces Orwell’s precise observations to banal truisms – politicians lie, groupthink is pernicious – and traps him in the second half of the 2010s. While Orwell’s best work may well be eternal, this peculiar book is already out of date.Dorian Lynskey is the author of The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell’s 1984 (Doubleday)• Orwell: A Man of Our Time by Richard Bradford is published by Bloomsbury Caravel (£18).

Since Thatcher was wrong about everything, her triumph did nothing for women, not even in principle. “To pay tribute to the first prime minister denoted by the female gender, OK but a woman? Not on my terms.” On Twitter, amid extravagant crowing about the witch being dead, the Labour MP Ian Lavery confirmed that female trailblazing is not, axiomatically, an advance. “It would be cowardly,” he announced, hours after Thatcher’s death, “for me not to comment on today’s news. No tears from me nor the mining communities destroyed by MT we R #theenemywithin.”It has since fallen to Harriet Harman, whose own career was stalled by in-party misogyny, to establish Thatcher’s eternal irrelevance as a role model. She told the ’s Simon Hattenstone how, as a young MP, with an infant in her arms, she spotted Thatcher, whom she considers “an aberration”, approaching. “She looked as if she was going to come and admire the baby. I had this terrible feeling of thinking, ‘I don’t want her to look at the baby,’ almost like one of those cartoons where the witch looks at the baby and the baby shrivels. I didn’t want my perfect baby to have Thatcher’s eyes upon him.” She added, more persuasively, that Thatcher “was not supportive of other women”.While there can be no doubt that any of the three women in Labour’s four-person leadership contest would ever knowingly shrivel a baby, the current leadership election has renewed arguments about the significance of a party leader’s sex. Emily Thornberry, who previously supported first Miliband, then Jeremy Corbyn over female candidates, says the party must now pick a woman – her – because she would frighten Boris Johnson. Having earlier supported Miliband, Burnham, then Corbyn, her colleague, Lavery, now the party’s chairman, says: “We need a female leader of the Labour party. Stand aside, Keir.”As instructive as it is to be re-educated in sex equality by Lavery, his historic reluctance to tell male candidates to “stand aside” is surely an admission that, notwithstanding the asset that is femaleness, other leadership skills such as actual policies, demonstrable competence and an attractive personality can be yet more important. If not, why not concede that Thatcher, being female, got one thing right?For Lavery, other priorities might include not being scared of Lavery, and awarding Corbyn 10 out of 10 for perfection. His fellow feminists may, however, attach greater importance to a candidate’s achievements for women. Without, for a second, dismissing any candidate as an aberration, their significance, as women, is doubtless meant to be more than physically verifiable more even than a gendered knack of looking kindly around babies. Can they cite any contributions towards, say, reducing violence against women and girls, protecting women’s rights, enhancing women’s autonomy?Apologies if I’ve missed something – although, given the detail supplied with other credentials, eg, familiarity with penury, anything notable would probably have surfaced by now. Thornberry? For a person who volunteers that her childhood cats had to be put down, presumably after the family was reduced to competing with them for mice, this infinitely adaptable MP has to date offered little by way of hard-won, womanly insights beyond a new claim, arguably more offensive than Thatcher’s household hints, that “any mother” would agree she was right to nick selective state school places (in a different county) intended for the less privileged.Though there is still time, of course, for this formerly doting apologist to discover a confidential memo in which she beseeches Corbyn not to mutter “stupid woman” under his breath.Long-Bailey? To date, the Corbynist idea of charisma appears to have achieved less for women than, despite not being a woman, did her main rival Keir Starmer, as director of public prosecutions. When he left, in 2013, Thornberry said (of the person she now calls a “machine politician”): “His values shone through with his emphasis on fighting violence against women and girls. He fulfilled a difficult role in a progressive and compassionate way… he has done his utmost to transform the CPS’s record on rape and domestic violence, delivering improved conviction rates for both.”Starmer, moreover, supports women’s reproductive autonomy. Long-Bailey favours restrictions on abortion (and likewise opposes assisted dying). Both politicians having chosen, like Thornberry, to serve Corbyn, they are contaminated, as Lisa Nandy is not, by the party’s documented misogyny its ineffectual approach to sexual misconduct. Actually, whatever did happen to the open letter, signed by more than 100 former and current staffers, about the handling of allegations against David Prescott, one of Corbyn’s senior aides, condemning “an environment where sexual harassment and bullying are not taken seriously”?And so to Nandy. Unimpeachably female. Unapologetically at ease with Brexit, and therefore with an outcome that is authoritatively predicted to hit women, via eroded legal protections and increased exposure to poverty, harder than it will men.Stand aside Keir? Why? What explains this prodigiously late-onset Labour reverence for female iconography? True, we can’t be absolutely sure Starmer wouldn’t shrivel a baby at 100 paces. But given the available competition, that could be the most compelling argument against him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

With not much in the way of action to talk about, however, the 16-year-old became the subject of post-match chatter, as a possible £30m move to Manchester United looms. The Birmingham manager, Pep Clotet, praised the teen’s character. Mark Robins, however, was even more effusive. “Jude Bellingham is outstanding,” said the Coventry manager. “The power and pace at 16 is there for everybody to see. He’s going to be a top player.” The midfielder might look to previous youthful sensations who made the move to Old Trafford, such as Nick Powell or even Wilfried Zaha, and know that there is no guarantee of continued progress. But at this point, and at such a tender age, it appears the stars are aligning for Bellingham. Paul MacInnesIf the flagship successes of Frank Lampard’s reign tend to be young and British, Mateo Kovacic’s prowess indicates the Chelsea manager is no one-trick pony. Underwhelming under Maurizio Sarri, notable largely for predictable substitutions involving Ross Barkley, the Croat has become a high-energy, high-class playmaker for Lampard. “I watched him last year and I liked him from afar,” said Lampard, who played a part in the decision to buy Kovacic. “It maybe wasn’t the easiest year for him.” It helps that his midfield is less rigid – “I never want it to be absolutely structured” – but Kovacic showed the ability to unlock Hull with a penetrative pass from deep. “I just saw a natural talent in the way that he can take people out of midfield and travel quickly with the ball,” Lampard added. “We have got a really good relationship, he loves to talk about his game and is very intelligent. I love working with him.” Richard JollyBilly Sharp is 34 next month. He has not scored since the opening day. But he produced a performance of revved-up, state-of-the-art centre-forward play at the Den, finding interesting spaces and standing out as a luminous presence in a muted game. Sharp has been around for so long it might be assumed his game would be all about the narrow areas close to goal at this stage. Not so here. The run to make space for Mo Besic’s opening goal was a piece of instinctive footballing art. At times Sharp stood on the touchline and let his midfield flood past. It isn’t hard to see why United fans and indeed their manager are so fond of a player who showed here Chris Wilder’s coaching and his eye for unusual movement have been eagerly received. Sharp has another year left on his contract. He looks good for it, a lesson in old dogs taking on new tricks. Barney Ronay“The last thought in my head as a I go to sleep tonight will be ‘what if’,” acknowledged Oxford’s manager, Karl Robinson, after Marcus Browne, his Middlesbrough loanee forward, missed a very presentable chance to book a fifth-round place. “Browny’s such a talent but his finishing is useless.” Such unvarnished honesty is rare among carefully PR tutored Premier League managers but this was a day for candour with both Robinson and Steve Bruce admitting they would have much preferred extra-time andor penalties to an energy-sapping replay. That match could be worth £500,000 to Oxford but they are chasing promotion and Robinson says his players are “at breaking point”. Bruce, meanwhile, was furious to see his winter break plans ruined. “It was supposed to be a week off,” he said. “But what’s the point if they shove replays in. It’s ridiculous.” Louise TaylorThe idea of the FA Cup as “a great leveller” is one of English football’s hoariest cliches, yet at Shrewsbury a veteran central-defensive duo comprising a World Cup finalist and a Champions League winner were given the fright of their lives by a frontline made entirely of lower-league journeymen. Which is no slight whatsoever on Shaun Whalley, Callum Lang and Josh Laurent and Jason Cummings, a quartet who were everything their opponents weren’t: purposeful, precise and supremely unflustered. But Shrewsbury’s comeback demonstrated how abstract notions such as momentum and belief can still trump the hard currency of talent and pedigree. It made for a fantastic second-half spectacle as a gang of third-tier attackers ran riot against the likely Premier League champions, capped with a full-on pitch invasion by jubilant home supporters. Try telling them the FA Cup has lost its magic. Alex HessOf Manchester United’s summer signings, Daniel James has lately struggled and Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a fine defender unsuited to the club’s attacking traditions. Harry Maguire has also been the subject of concern, culpable amid multiple defensive pratfalls. It seems, though, that Ole Gunnar Solskjær cannot bear to be without his captain. While those other signings were rested at Tranmere, Maguire, playing through a torn hip muscle, soldiered on and should draw confidence from his performance. Playing left of a defensive trio allowed him to stride forward in the fashion that made his name at Hull and Leicester. His goal was beautifully struck before it deflected off Peter Clarke. He even got a rest when substituted just past the hour. The formation suggested a way forward for Solskjær and his most trusted lieutenant but tougher tests than this await, starting with Manchester City on Wednesday. John BrewinWest Ham are in a mess. The recruitment department is in pieces and was further stripped back when Manuel Pellegrini and his director of football, Mario Husillos, were fired last month. Pellegrini and Husillos both used their sons as scouts – they have departed too – and the dysfunction is deeply worrying given that West Ham, who were deservedly dumped out of the FA Cup by 10-man West Brom, need signings before the transfer window shuts on Friday. David Moyes, who has his eye on the Slavia Prague midfielder Tomas Soucek, has made little impact since replacing Pellegrini as West Ham’s manager and was unable to promise there will be much activity this week. David Sullivan, the club’s powerful co-owner, has resumed control of transfer negotiations and is under increasing pressure to get an unbalanced, injury-hit squad out of a hole. Jacob SteinbergIn what was the most routine of wins for Manchester City, where few forced themselves out of second gear to thrash the 10 men of Fulham, David Silva reminded the country of his greatness. The Spanish magician is leaving the Premier League at the end of the season, drawing the curtains on a decade in England. Since his arrival from Valencia he has arguably been the best player in those 10 years but his powers looked to be waning this season, not a surprise for someone who turned 34 this month. Sunday, however, was another masterclass of skill, passing and intelligent running. Silva also showed his aggressive side to win the ball for Gabriel Jesus’s first goal, proving he still has the desire. We only have him for a few more months of Silva, so we should cherish him before he departs for the final chapter of his career.

This is the game?”I am in Italy with my partner, and just like every beach holiday since 1999, I have booted up Pokémon. This particular version is Pokémon Sun for the Nintendo 3DS, but all the games are fundamentally the same: you’re a child leaving home to catch and train tiny monsters so you can defeat various bosses and bad guys. My boyfriend, who has never played Pokémon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.“It’s so … slow.”I consider, for the first time, what the Pokémon games look like to a person who has never played them. They are slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The “battles” you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the “moves”? You see very little of them. Rattata uses “tackle” and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.Why have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pokémon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, “gotta catch ’em all” game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.If you’ve ever played Pokémon, you know exactly what I’m talking about. The guilt you feel when it’s time to bench your Pidgeot – the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 – because you know he can’t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. The game encourages you to evolve your Pokémon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style “Find the princess!” prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.One visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pokémon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pokémon “faint” if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we’ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pokémon die and they are mourned.That’s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: “Ghosts appeared in Pokémon Tower. I think they’re the spirits of Pokémon that the Rockets killed.” So Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.The Pokémon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of Pokémon Blue and Red, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. Take the gym leaders. These are the game’s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock’s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge’s deranged Electric-type gym you’re forced to sort through trash before he’ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate – do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that’s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it’s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pokémon.From the beginning, Pokémon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave an interview to Time magazine about the mysterious and elusive Pokémon named Mew, which was added to Pokémon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. “There were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,” Tajiri explained. “It created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there … It kept the interest alive.”For decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player for years, many players believed that Mew was hidden behind that elusive vehicle.The sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly s, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric gym leader, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn’t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pokémon who are willing to fight for you – it all makes sense.As a novelist, I’m keenly aware that people won’t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pokémon games, if I weren’t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: “I like shorts. They’re comfy and easy to wear.” Trust me, they’ll understand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b5df53eea4f1707b11f8fda0e6af1f266f69c2/0_3_5227_3137/master/5227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068cda3cfd40c38f1040488550f3e168","title":"its incredible what they see housing associations take on county lines","story":"Housing officers are using their local knowledge to spot abuse and exploitation, particularly ‘cuckooing’ of vulnerable residents by drug gangsHousing associations are playing a growing role in tackling county lines crimes, using their knowledge of local communities to spot early signs of abuse and exploitation.In the north west of England, the exploitation of young people by drug gangs – known as “county lines” crime – is a serious problem, not just in poorer areas but in York, Harrogate and places with good transport links. Now lawyers, housing associations and police are building networks of support to try and provide innovative solutions to the crisis.One firm of solicitors told the  they are increasingly contacted by housing associations for help in responding to exploitation, in particular “cuckooing”.Cuckooing is a term for the takeover of a house owned by a vulnerable inidual by drug gangs from outside the area to use as a base.Darren Burton, head of housing at Forbes Solicitors, says housing associations have unique access to vulnerable communities.“Our clients provide social housing to the most vulnerable in society, making their tenants a target for criminals. There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs.“Housing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.”Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. “They are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots they have always been there on the ground.”The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and these are on the rise across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation.But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways.“For example, one property we are looking at, it’s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved.“We have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can’t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.”The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions.In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man’s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors.Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the  that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation.“Across the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It’s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don’t leave potential victims homeless.”He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. “Now we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let’s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can ert them we will hopefully see that impact in the future.”Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, Plus Dane Housing. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks.“I had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are.“For example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it’s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It’s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.”It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says.“Cuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like pop-up brothels. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It’s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.”“There is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do – kids are offered £1,000 a day to carry drugs and it’s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd5eb050a5816cd20e351ab3b79be035b4bb295/0_0_5513_3308/master/5513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb4dcb44fe8645517cb1cf992b3b8879","title":"mogadishu left reeling as climate and conflict spark rural exodus","story":"Forced from their homes by floods and fighting, 800,000 people have crammed into informal settlements in the Somali capital. Now efforts are afoot to bolster local resourcesThe number of Somalians being pushed out of the countryside and into the capital Mogadishu has reached an unprecedented high, putting pressure on the city’s already poor infrastructure and threatening its faltering recovery from three decades of conflict.More than 800,000 internally displaced people dwell in informal settlements across Mogadishu, according to the office of the mayor. They are crammed into makeshift shelters with little or no sanitation and limited access to the most basic services. There are “critical” levels of malnutrition, according to an assessment by Somalia’s food security and nutrition analysis unit.Scattered over 700 sites across the capital, families mainly consisting of women and children share common latrines and survive on one meal a day.Last week, Goobjoog News, a local radio station in Mogadishu, reported that about a dozen children had died of starvation in one encampment in Kahda district. Among them, said the station, were young twins whose mother had been killed in last month’s truck bomb explosion.Every morning, women from the these camps head into the city centre, looking for casual jobs such as clothes washing. With no family or clan connections to the local host community, they face abuse and sexual exploitation.Mogadishu, second on Demographia’s 2015 ranking of the fastest growing cities in the world, has limited capacity to integrate such a large number of displaced people into its urban development system.“The most significant challenge posed by conflict and natural disaster induced displacement is its impact on rapid and unplanned urbanisation and the rural exodus,” said Dr Hodan Ali, head of Benadir regional administration’s durable solutions unit.“Mogadishu is emerging from 30 years of conflict. The infrastructure, basic services and local government capacity are extremely limited and, as such, its ability to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and impoverished members of the city is small.”Capitalising on the gap left by a weak government and the lack of a formal camp management system, an illicit business has sprung up, with “gatekeepers” soliciting land for new arrivals, linking them up with aid agencies, and in return taking a cut of what little aid they may receive.Humanitarian organisations with limited access to the camps due to security restrictions are left with little choice but to collaborate with the unofficial gatekeepers, in effect paying – and empowering – illicit middlemen.More people arrive in Mogadishu daily, driven to the city by multiple climate shocks and violence between al-Shabaab, Amisom and the Somali national forces. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people arrived in the capital, many of them returnees from refugee camps in Kenya and Yemen.Nationally, over 2.6 million Somalis are displaced within the country, with Mogadishu hosting the largest concentration of people forced from their homes. Many in the city have not had a permanent home since the civil war broke out in 1991.However, with funding from donors including the UK government and EU, the local authority has been trying to strengthen its urban resilience capacity to absorb and integrate the city’s mass displacement camps. The Mogadishu municipality established a dedicated durable solutions unit in the mayor’s office and last year developed a policy for internally displaced people.Somalia’s overall humanitarian situation remains critical, with more than 5 million people in need of assistance according to figures jointly released by the UN and federal government of Somalia. The recent flooding in many parts of the country, which affected over half a million people, has compounded the already dire humanitarian crisis.Last Monday, the durable solutions unit launched a five-year strategy to address the growing number of displaced people in the region.“The strategy over the next five years focuses on strengthening local government to respond to the basic and protection needs of its citizens in good time, with adequate resources and be accountable to the people,” said Ali.However, the greatest immediate uncertainty for people displaced to Mogadishu remains forceful evictions, since most are staying on private land. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people were pushed off temporary settlements.“We hope to ensure that even in the first year of the strategy, we see a minimum of 30,000 people who are now displaced move out of the displacement towards development,” said Ali, speaking at the launch event.“The biggest challenge we have in Mogadishu is that the majority of the investment goes into aid and handouts. I don’t think that is an effective way of utilising hundreds of millions of dollars and having to see the conditions we have in the camps.“So it is really important to pull all these resources to have one common output. We hope to have more engagements and discussions with our international partners to ensure that we are all working for the same goal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

I would have told you how I could never give up cheese and how I worried about a vegan diet being healthy. I knew that they weren’t the strongest nor the most informed of reasons, so I would have added that I only bought meat when I could afford to buy organic and British, and always bought free-range eggs. I would have wanted you to know I was informed about what was “good” or “bad” farming practice, and I shopped accordingly.I had been a vegetarian on and off since I was a teenager, and cared deeply about the planet. I recycled diligently, carried a reusable water bottle, signed petitions to address the climate disaster and joined protests. I bought cruelty-free makeup, was fervently against animal testing. I was a conscious and conscientious shopper and consumer: I considered the planet when I made choices.For almost my whole life I had been concerned about the planet. As a child, I’d lecture my hairspray-wielding nan about CFCs in primary school I held a bake sale to raise money for the RSPB, the British bird-protection charity, after the Shetland oil disaster in 1993. I was mindful of the environment, and proud of it.Just not mindful enough to make a huge lifestyle change that would be disruptive. Even these days, veganism is frequently inconvenient in that you are always having to check packaging (items you think are safe may have changed their ingredients), trust other people when they are preparing food for you and check everywhere you go in advance for vegan options.So how did I end up a vegan? It all started when I met my friend Sophie’s partner, Rey. We were having a barbecue in Burgess park in south London, and Sophie and I had to wait to eat because Rey and his friends wanted to cook first as they were vegan. They weren’t righteous or aggressive about our food choices, and we didn’t roll our eyes or make jokes about theirs. We had a nice day out.When Sophie and Rey announced they were expecting a baby, she told me she was going vegan, and would raise their child as a vegan. I’m embarrassed about it now, but I was concerned – all my knowledge of veganism came from random snippets of internet lore. What about calcium? What about protein? What about vitamins? Wasn’t it dangerous? Sophie very patiently told me what she knew, and directed me to look things up for myself.So, I did visiting websites, reading leaflets, watching documentaries and filling in the gaps of my knowledge. What I learned started to stick: I became vegetarian again, lapsed and then went back to it. I couldn’t reconcile what I had learned about the realities of the meat and dairy industries with the person I believed myself to be. I asked Sophie – for the first time – why she decided to become a vegan. She wasn’t like me, a so-called advocate for the planet and animal rights. In fact, she was probably the last person I’d expect to become a vegan. “Because I don’t need to eat meat, eggs or dairy,” she told me. “Things don’t have to suffer or die for me to live well.”That was the moment it clicked. Consuming meat and dairy was admitting I was OK with animals suffering and dying for my pleasureconveniencesurvival. But I could choose something different. So I did.I became vegan two years ago. Of course, I am in a position where being a vegan is easy: no food allergies or relevant health issues, enough money to buy speciality vegan ingredients to liven things up, no dependents, time to cook. The impact that it has had on me has been huge. I have seen an improvement in my overall health – an unexpected benefit tighter friendships with vegan friends (it’s the new smoking in terms of social connection). Before I became vegan, I was never much of a cook, but now it has become a hobby. I love experimenting and finding ways of “veganising” food I used to eat.More than that, it has begun to change every aspect of how I live as I try to always minimise suffering, and do my best for the planet. I am lucky to live in a town with eco-friendly refill shops. I have started making my own body moisturiser, cleaning spray, laundry detergent and “toilet fizzers” to cut down on disposable plastics and chemicals. I question where things I buy come from: who made them? How did they get here? How long will they last? I am trying to be a better consumer, even if it is inconvenient sometimes.In the end, what it came down to was having the courage of my convictions to embrace veganism. Now I am proud to be walking the walk.Hold Back the Tide by Melinda Salisbury is published by Scholastic in March (£7.99).

You are clearly hoping that selling a buy-to-let property and buying another would make you eligible to claim business asset roll-over relief but it doesn’t. Roll-over relief lets you put off paying any capital gains tax (CGT) due on the gain from the sale of a business asset until you sell the business asset that you bought to replace it but only – among other things – if you are trading. And HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) doesn’t consider investing in a buy-to-let property as trading.HMRC does, however, have special rules that mean that if you make money from furnished holiday lettings you would be eligible to claim roll-over relief if you sold a holiday let and bought another one. To count as a furnished holiday letting – and so qualify for roll-over relief – the property must be furnished and available for letting for at least 210 days in the tax year and let as holiday accommodation for at least 105 days. More information on who can claim the relief – and how to do it – is available in Helpsheet 290: Business Asset Roll-over Relief published by HMRC.

The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp. Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet PoWs and at least 10,000 from other nationalities. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp. Susan Pollack and Ivor Perl were children when they were transported to the camp, two of an ever decreasing number of survivors who are able to provide first-hand testimony of what happened to them.

The death toll on stretches of smart or managed motorways has reached 38 in the last five years, including many in accidents that motoring organisations believe were avoidable after breakdowns.Smart motorways bring extra capacity on congested motorways, but many motorists report feeling unsafe, with far more breakdowns ending up with cars trapped in live lanes of fast-moving traffic.About 200 miles of motorway in Britain have been converted to “smart running”, where the hard shoulder is used as an extra lane when motorists are instructed by electronic signs on overhead gantries.A freedom of information request by the BBC Panorama programme, to be broadcast on Monday night, found that in five years before one section of the M25 was converted into a smart motorway there were just 72 near-misses. In the five years after conversion, there were 1,485 such dangerous incidents. Panorama’s investigation also revealed that one of the electronic warning signs was out of action for 336 days.Edmund King, the AA president, said the current system was not fit for purpose. He added: “The real scandal is the avoidable deaths – people who have broken down in a live lane and been unable to move until a vehicle has ploughed into the back of them.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the BBC: “We absolutely have to have these as safe or safer as regular motorways or we shouldn’t have them at all.”It is understood Shapps has asked Department for Transport officials to review evidence on the safety of smart motorways, with recommendations expected to follow soon.The government is also understood to be considering introducing more radar detection systems to identify vehicles broken down on the hard shoulder, as well as building more emergency lay-bys.Research by the AA suggests it takes an average of 17 minutes for highway authorities to spot a stopped vehicle, and then another 17 minutes for emergency vehicles to reach the scene. “You spend an average of more than half an hour sitting there in a broken-down vehicle praying,” said the AA.“Meanwhile, some of the extra capacity is being negated because people are terrified to drive on the inside lane, for fear of a broken down vehicle ahead.”King said the scheme was rolled out on the back of trials on the M42 near Birmingham, but that the same level of protection had not been replicated elsewhere – particularly the distance between emergency refuge areas, where vehicles in distress can stop in the absence of a hard shoulder. On the M42 pilot, the areas were 500-600 metres apart, compared with 2,500 metres on other smart motorways.His concerns were echoed by a former government minister, who approved the roll-out of smart motorways. Sir Mike Penning agreed to the expansion in 2010 while a junior transport minister, after the successful pilot.Now, however, Penning has told Panorama that smart motorways are endangering people’s lives. He said: “There are people that are being killed and seriously injured on these roads, and it should never have happened.”MPs led by Penning are due to publish a report on Tuesday that will accuse Highways England of “a shocking degree of carelessness” in implementing the motorway system. The all-party parliamentary group for roadside rescue and recovery will call for a moratorium on conversion of motorways until their safety is proven."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d75d25b7dd33c3bb223d46c39200fea4acc79c5/0_52_5178_3107/master/5178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20a4d6a19bb889f2daee40ae0940319c","title":"what happens on brexit day and what comes next","story":"This Friday, 31 January, marks the start of a race to get a trade deal done by the end of the yearThere will be little official pageantry to mark Britain’s departure from the European Union at 11pm on Friday. A clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, and Nigel Farage will host a celebration in Parliament Square where flagpoles will fly union jacks.But there will be nothing like the torchlight procession that marked the august occasion on 1 January 1973 when the prime minister Edward Heath was joined in Brussels by his predecessors Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and a chorus of leaders from across the political ide to witness the accession of the UK into the European Economic Community.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration. Yes. Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck pointed out last week in London. We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.“The UK is five days away from entering into a highly complex and potentially extensive set of negotiations with the EU, and from entering into quite an elaborate joint institutional architecture with the EU to manage the withdrawal agreement. But we know little in detail about how either of these are going to work on the UK side, in terms of institutions and process,” says Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher with the Hansard Society.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Johnson is doing everything he can to expunge the word Brexit from the British lexicon. He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be.Negotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks. Until Sunday, when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that they would be published, it had not been clear that Johnson would do so at all.The prime minister is expected to give further clues in a keynote speech in the next fortnight, but parliament’s involvement in approving the negotiating mandate was removed from the Brexit bill.“Essentially, the government seems to be planning to rely on normal mechanisms for ministerial accountability to parliament. These put the government in control of what information is made public and when,” says Fowler.A reshuffle is expected in early February and some departments are expected to be axed. Barclay’s Brexit department will close on Friday and there could be changes to the function of the Treasury, the Department for International Trade, the Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, continues to head a special Exiting the EU operation committee, known as XO, and is expected to continue to have a key role in the next phase.HMRC will be one of the key cogs in the Brexit chain as work must start urgently on the complex arrangements for Northern Ireland that will affect all businesses trading on both sides of the Irish Sea. Expect an early clash between the EU and Johnson, who has repeatedly claimed there will be no checks on goods, in contradiction of the withdrawal agreement.New border systems will be needed for the rest of the UK, and the EU and HMRC will be frustrated in designing them until the shape of the deal is known, possibly not until the summer. HMRC is short of key personnel and recently advertised for a deputy director to take charge of EU exit, who “will be responsible for providing the strategic direction for the project, delivering all the operational, communications and business changes needed in readiness for the UK’s exit.”A former head of HMRC has said it could take five years to get the sort of IT system proposed for Northern Ireland up and running.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.Under the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee of EU and UK representatives to oversee implementation of the treaty can sit from 1 February.While the powers of the committee are known, we know very little else. The appointments process, the size of the committee and how often it will meet has yet to be disclosed. One senior source said the committee would not be as influential as speculated.This remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said last week that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs contradicted him directly on Sunday telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks on the island of Ireland, we’ve been very clear on this.”Underneath the joint committee will be a specialised committee and working advisory group to establish the Northern Ireland protocol.Northern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up the working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

But there’s an elevated level of discomfort when talking about race and culture in sport and we need to get beyond this if we are genuinely going to do something about the ethnicity gap.”The study from Sport England, based on surveys of more than 100,000 adults and children, found that while the gap exists across all ethnic groups, it is most pronounced for women of black African and Asian heritage.The new campaign seeks to lower the barriers to participation across the country and improve understanding of the intersectionality between issues such as ethnicity, gender, age and affluence.“As the amazing example of Ebony Horse Club shows, if you parachute a riding club into the heart of an estate in Brixton, and properly invite local young people into it, some of them will fall in love with riding,” Grant will add. “But only a few get the chance to find out where their talent could take them.“Denying and wasting talent on an industrial scale is not just morally wrong. As a nation, we also need to make the most of all the advantages at our disposal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9882e288f04479cfc22d055a440560e424e4b921/0_194_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b889005378c1ed787e3437876bcc0990","title":"chasing pack close gap england women six nations","story":"The Women’s Six Nations begins with one big question lingering over it: can anyone lay a glove on England? Grand slam champions in 2019, with 45 tries scored and a points difference of 233, Simon Middleton’s team also had the best inidual players. The fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean scored the most points and the wing Jessica Breach the most tries (there was no female player of the tournament that accolade will be introduced for the first time this year).Since then England have enjoyed a dominant autumn and can also boast they have the world’s best player in their ranks: Emily Scarratt, who received that accolade in November. The strength of the 15-times champions, whose players are full-time professionals unlike most of their competitors, does not bode well for their opponents and some may also say the competition itself. But the ominous news is Middleton is looking only for improvement in 2020.“Complacency is something that never enters our camp, our mindset,” he says before Sunday’s opening fixture with France. “As coaches we wouldn’t allow it, senior players within the group wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I think our biggest challenge is very much: be better than our last performance. Win or lose, as long as we improve our performance, we’re heading in the right direction.”The strongest competition for the Red Roses is likely to come from the continental mainland. Italy finished a commendable second in last year’s championship while France – who have a number of players on part-time contracts – have the pedigree of champions, if not the form (they lost to England four times last year).As for the home nations, however, almost every team is in some kind of rebuild. Ireland are the most established side and their captain, Ciara Griffin, talks of “getting a unity and a collective performance”. Their ambitions are to bring an attacking style of play to bear – “It’s a real fast-pace game, we want to play exciting rugby,” Griffin says – but also to maintain momentum before the greater priority of ensuring World Cup qualification through the Rugby Europe competition in September. “We know if we can have some good performances in the Six Nations that should roll into our summer,” says their coach, Adam Griggs. “Hopefully it will help us out in the qualifiers.”Ireland will be joined by Scotland in the qualifiers and their mountain is the biggest of all to climb. The Scots finished with the wooden spoon last year after failing to claim a point. Scotland now have 10 players with central contracts, however, and a new coach in Philip Doyle, the 55-year-old who won the Six Nations with Ireland’s women in 2013. “It’ll take a bit of time and a lot of effort, but I think with this particular squad Scotland could be a force to be reckoned with … in a certain period of time,” Doyle says. “This year it’s just about closing those gaps and getting competitive. Putting Scotland where they really should be, back to where they were.”Wales, like England, qualify automatically for the World Cup but have had their own restructure – with some resources now shared between the men’s and women’s game. Closing the distance to the English remains key for them too, according to their captain, Siwan Lillicrap. “I think we need to take every game as it comes but we’re not necessarily speaking about winning, we’re speaking about closing the performance gap,” she says. “Every training session we go to is about closing that gap and enhancing our performance. We keep on this path, then the results will look after themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3ff4bceb06cec3476c8d367a13d567ce774c50d/53_50_1947_1168/master/1947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b03a0ac6d4de0d40fc629cd1f5f417","title":"kobe bryant basketball nba","story":"The iconic superstar’s tragic death is a seismic loss with his contribution instrumental in raising the sport’s global profileKobe Bryant, who died on Sunday in a helicopter crash in California at the age of 41, was one of the most accomplished players in league history, an 18-time All-Star, a two-time NBA Finals MVP and the 2007-2008 league MVP. As a member of Team USA he won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. His 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 is the second-highest single-game total in NBA history. In his final game in 2016 he scored 60 points against the Utah Jazz, the most of any player in his last contest.On Saturday night LeBron James passed Bryant to become the third all-time leading scorer in league history, which Bryant celebrated with a tweet congratulating his former opponent and Olympic teammate.A titanic figure who inspired a generation of basketball players nationally and internationally, Bryant made his debut in 1996 at 18 and played 20 seasons for the Lakers before retiring. Bryant and the center Shaquille O’Neal led the Lakers to the remarkable feat of winning three consecutive titles from 1999-2002 – something accomplished by just two other franchises – and won two more titles between 2008-2010 after O’Neal’s departure. After his retirement, Bryant secured himself as a Los Angeles legend and one of the most iconic athletes in world history.His stardom reached well beyond Los Angeles, as he led the league in jersey sales five times over the course of his career and is believed to have sold more jerseys internationally than every NBA player except Michael Jordan. The son of Joe “Jelly Bean” Bryant, who played in the NBA for eight seasons before becoming a star in Italy, Kobe Bryant was arguably the most worldly of any NBA star in history – he could confidently conduct interviews in Spanish and Italian – and was instrumental in raising the sport’s international profile.His international popularity may have even dwarfed his national celebrity, as he was routinely met by mobs of fans – he once had to escape a reported 15,000 adoring supporters when landing in China for an appearance in the late 2000s – wherever he travelled.Within the game Bryant will be remembered as one of basketball’s most ferocious competitors, tireless workers and demanding teammates. With an intense, often ruthless insistence on attention to detail and fundamental soundness, Bryant’s mastery of basketball mechanics – proper defensive positioning, sound mid-range jump shooting and unparalleled toughness – made him one of the game’s most admired players in an era dominated by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan.Much of Bryant’s appeal to aspiring athletes came from what he called “The Mamba Mentality”, which Bryant famously described as “if you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear”. His singular obsession with discipline, winning and enormous personality made him one of the most polarising players of his time – he endured public fallouts with O’Neal, the coach Phil Jackson and several onerous contract negotiations with Lakers management. His public legacy was chequered by a 2003 sexual assault scandal, when a 19-year-old hotel employee accused Bryant of raping her in a hotel room. Bryant admitted to committing adultery and issued an apology to the accuser but denied the assault allegations. The criminal charges were eventually dropped and the parties settled in a civil lawsuit.What was never questioned was his devotion to the game of basketball, the admiration that he inspired across the league and the love he had for his four daughters, one of whom, Gianna, died with him, aged 13. He memorialised his career in his Academy Award winning short, Dear Basketball, and became one of the game’s most vocal proponents in retirement. He became central in the development of his daughter Gianna’s career, serving as a coach and mentor to her teams and emerged as a major influence in women’s basketball.Gianna is the second of his four daughters, between Natalia, 17, three-year-old Bianka and seven-month-old Capri.Bryant routinely visited the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks as an informal advisor and worked with other women at all levels of basketball. One of the last viral photos of Bryant was him offering pointers to Gianna, herself a promising teenage prospect, during a game last month.Bryant’s loss is a seismic one not just for basketball but for a generation of Los Angeles natives whose bedroom walls were adorned with his posters and the countless iniduals he inspired over the course of his 20-year career. The loss of a legend who matured from basketball superstar to devoted family man (husband of Vanessa) to global basketball ambassador is a palpable tragedy that left the world shocked, grieving and reminiscing about the thrills he delivered over the course of three decades. As the longtime NBA coach David Fizdale told ESPN on Sunday : “The Lakers are the heartbeat of LA and Kobe Bryant was the blood running through it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ab048d62ec35c148dd3965f1eb1b7db1712360/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc48966f0b57c388effb07e181e65bfe","title":"tell us about your favourite kobe bryant moment","story":"We would like to hear from you about the NBA great, who has died aged 41Kobe Bryant, the former LA Lakers star and one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has died in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles county.Over a career ning 20 seasons, Bryant won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals. He was also named an All-Star 18 times before retiring in 2016 as the league’s third-highest all-time scorer.The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said: “He will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability”.“Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players,” said Magic Johnson, another Laker great, while civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said: “Kobe was instrumental to so many people.

This time, a quick love hold from Nadal to retain his early lead. Some great serving from the world number one to reach 40-0 and then he closed it off with a moment of pure class, hooking a gorgeous angled forehand for a clean winner while on the run.Rafael Nadal *1-1 Nick Kyrgios. A quick hold for Kyrgios to open his account. Nadal very quickly showed that he will be going after his forehand whenever he can at 30-15 he crushed an inside out forehand that just skidded out. Kyrgios sealed his first hold of the day with a service winner. There will be many more.Rafael Nadal 1-0* Nick Kyrgios: The world number one seals his opening hold, but it wasn’t easy. Nadal double faulted twice in the game, including at 40-30 to bring them back to deuce. From deuce, he found a big serve and then forced a Kyrgios error with a firm crosscourt backhand to hold.There is no love lost between these two and Kyrgios has always been very happy to discuss that. Here are Kyrgios’ comments on Nadal during his wide-ranging interview with Ben Rothenberg on the No Challenges Remaining podcast last year.“He’s my polar opposite. Literally my polar opposite. And he’s super salty.“When he wins it’s fine, he won’t say anything bad, he’ll credit the opponent - ‘he competed well today, he’s a great player’ - but then as soon as I beat him, it’s just like ‘he has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game’. I’m like ‘what are you talking about? I literally played this way that I beat you the other previous times and nothing changed’.The players are on-court. Kyrgios is a huge NBA fan and he unsurprisingly warmed up wearing Kobe Bryant’s laker jersey. As he sat down in his chair, Kyrgios was crying.So, where will this match be won? Rafael Nadal narrowly leads the head to head 4-3 with the pair splitting their matches in 2019. Kyrgios famously toppled Nadal in Acapulco, with the Aussie playing an underarm serve and complaining about Nadal taking his time between points. Nadal followed up a few months later with a statement win at Wimbledon. Ever since Kyrgios burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2014, shocking Nadal in four stunning sets in the fourth round, this has been one of the truly gripping matchups of the past 6 years.There is no big match player like Nick Kyrgios. On any given day against a lowly ranked opponent, he could find himself drawn into endless rallies but he almost always elevates his game against the elite. His first priority will be to take care of his service games, but he will also be looking to keep points as short as he possibly can. He will flatten out his groundstrokes and thump winners off both wings and he will throw in a constant variety of drop shots and net forays to keep Nadal off balance.For Nadal, serving well will also be key and so it’s helpful that he is in the serving form of his life. He will also look to slip into the net when he can and he spend a lot of time working on Kyrgios’ backhand and moving him side-to-side when he can. He will certainly look to be aggressive and open up his forehand down the line, but he will also force Kyrgios to be perfect, to always find the huge forehand winner or perfect dropshot on the biggest points. If Kyrgios is not perfect, he will lose.A solid upset to start the morning as Stan Wawrinka takes out US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev. A result like this has been coming for the three-time slam champion in recent months. He has played well for a while now but he just hasn’t quite been able to reach his top level over 5 sets against the very best. He did today.As we wait for the night session to begin, one match is reaching its dramatic conclusion. 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka has rediscovered some vintage form against 4th seed Daniil Medvedev and he currently leads Medvedev by a double break in the fifth set at *5-2. He is on the brink of perhaps his best win since he underwent knee surgery in 2017.Hello! Welcome to day 8 of our Australian Open coverage as the first half of fourth round action comes to an end. Tonight’s session will feature three singles matches: On Melbourne Arena, 22 year-olds Alexander Zverev and Andrey Medvedev will fight to reach the quarters. Rublev has been the in-form player this year and he is currently on a 15 match winning streak having won two tournaments in the first two weeks of the year. On Margaret Court Arena, 2016 champion Angelique Kerber will attempt to return to the quarterfinals when she faces last year’s quarterfinalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who scuppered Karolina Pliskova in the third round.But most eyes will be on Rod Laver Arena as Nick Kyrgios takes on Rafael Nadal in front of his home crowd for the first time. The world number one has mostly coasted through the tournament playing high quality tennis and he still hasn’t dropped a set. Kyrgios arrives in the third Australian Open fourth round with the crowd firmly behind him. He has played well and fought even harder, edging out a 5th set tiebreak win over 16th seed Kharen Khachanov to reach the fourth round. The question is how his body has recovered after the first four and a half hour battle of his career, and if he has recovered, whether it even that be enough to topple the in-form world number one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965c2371ed05655a491d47791552b6900a7175c5/0_0_3512_2107/master/3512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daf808cbdba678c0aec2f28100a86f08","title":"south africa v england fourth test day four live","story":"8th over: South Africa 21-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 11) A productive start to the Curran over, Malan pushing a couple through cover then pushing one to midwicket. Elgar is in on the act too, clipping the third ball in front of the square leg umpire for four. Lovely timing. I suspect we’ll be seeing Mark Wood very soon.“Morning Adam, morning everyone.” Good morning to you, Robert Ellson. “Have to say I have mixed feelings about Jerusalem. I was at the Galle Test last winter, where Billy the Trumpet played it from the top of the Fort, and the overall effect was both dodgily colonial and thrillingly magnificent. But I’m not sure he should go to his retirement without someone mentioning that he plays the wonderful solo at the end of this beautiful Divine Comedy song.” Yep, it’s contested space, that’s for sure. Every major political party has used it at one time or another. In fairness to the Barmy Army (I’m sometimes a little nasty about them on twitter) the did start the Jerusalem thing. Per the piece I posted, it was their idea back in 1998, which the ECB picked up in 2003. The marketing boss at the time had been to watch some professional wrestling and decided the England team needed some walk-on music. And there it was born for home Tests. 7th over: South Africa 13-0 (Malan 7, Elgar 6) Sure enough, Broad beats Elgar with his first delivery, around the wicket in at the left-hander, tailing away in the manner he did so magnificently and repeatedly to David Warner during the Ashes. But the opener keeps his cool, pushing one from the next delivery to give Malan the strike. Broad is up for leg before to the right-hander with a ball that slips past the edge and hits the back pad from wide of the crease but it hits him well outside the line and is missing the off-stump. Root was wise not to entertain a review.6th over: South Africa 11-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 5) Ooh, Curran finds Elgar’s inside edge when cutting and it was nearly all over for the opener - not far away from the woodwork. He’s off strike later in the over to backward point, which will now give Stuart Broad a chance at the left-hander for the first time in this innings.5th over: South Africa 10-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 4) That’s a lovely cover drive from Malan, getting well forward to Broad and stroking him through the line out to the boundary. Earlier in the over the England cordon were up for leg before when he missed a flick but it was going to miss leg stump. The series might be over for South Africa but there’s plenty of time here for Malan to leave a lasting mark.4th over: South Africa 6-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 4) Curran beats Elgar to begin with a delivery moving away both in the air and off the seam. He has another little victory later in the over when finding his leading edge, which spits out through the cordon for four. We talked a lot about Denly and Butter’s need of runs yesterday and the same applies to Elgar. His decline is getting problematic.“Morning Adam.” Hello, Michael Anderson. “On the topic of Philander’s pleasingly rounded stats, a score of 56 not out or 81 out in this innings would leave him with an overall test average of exactly 25. Unlikely perhaps but would be nice.”That’d be a thing of beauty - 5000 runs conceded averaging 25 when batting. I’m one of those aforementioned weirdos who likescravesneeds evenround numbers. And right angles, much to the enduring annoyance of my partner. 3rd over: South Africa 2-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 0) South Africa are off the mark via Malan, who tucks a couple off Broad through midwicket. It’s a less probing over than his first, the opener able to shoulder arms for the most part.I spent some time in the pub after the second day of this Test with Daniel Norcross and Andy Zaltzman trying to work out how many wickets Stuart Broad will finish with. We landed on 560. The assumptions: he’ll play every Test in England over the next two years but only every other in IndiaAustralia during the winter. And I can’t imagine why they would take him to Sri Lanka in March - let him rest.2nd over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Slammin’ Sammy Curran has the new ball from the other end, as he has throughout the second half of this series. He’s generating some nice shape away from Elgar from the get-go, the opener defending when he has to and leaving the rest outside the off stump. Nice.An olddiscontinued email address of mine was featuring at the top of the page earlier today, which is fixed now. Hit refresh for it to automatically correct on your browster. If you want to get in touch at any stage, this is how you do it. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Nice and full from Broad to begin, which is always encouraging. He beats Malan’s inside edge to finish, whacking into his back pad. There’s half an appeal but it is going well over the top. Nice start.There is a lot of love for Jerusalem as Billy the Trumpeter enjoys his final rendition before ‘retiring’ in his role. Four years ago, I spent too much time going back through the history of the poem, looking at how it became England’s cricket anthem. The piece featured in The Nightwatchman and is online these days.The players are on the field. Stuart Broad has the new ball, Pieter Malan the man facing up first. Three slips and a gully are his catchers, a short leg too. PLAY! What a gem from Andrew Samson. Of course, this is Vernon Philander’s final Test, which prompts plenty of discussion around stats. But they don’t get much better than this for those of us who always have their TV volume on multiples of five.An email from overnight to get us going. “All this mention of what we can and can’t hear on stump mic brings to mind some of the epic exchanges that we heard in the early days during World Series Cricket,” writes Scott Probst. “The best, and least repeatable were the conversations between those two poets Dennis Lillee and Garth Le Roux. Kept us up nights at boarding school, waiting for those two to go at it from either end of the pitch.”This always comes up in South Africa. I remember (fondly?) when Australia visited for the first time since readmission in 1994... you could hear everything. Shane Warne and Merv Hughes would have faced lengthy bans by today’s standards. “It’s not a minefield,” says Athers of the track on TV, “but there’s plenty there for the bowlers.” Indeed, there’s a healthy string of cracks at one end. Joe Root walks up and takes a look. “He’s the new Jim Laker,” Athers adds. The Sky coverage, both their callers on the SuperSport team and panels in London, has been excellent.Hello and welcome to the fourth day at the Bull Ring - the fourth and final day if the visitors have anything to do with it. They would never admit as much, but surely on days like today they arrive thinking about how wonderful life would be if they could wrap up the match half an hour before tea before settling into a lengthy session as the sun sets on the series and their successful Test tour.England have earned themselves a finish like that, just as their South African hosts are deserved the drubbing coming their way. It’s a simple game now, Joe Root’s men needing ten wickets to salute 3-1 with two full days to go. For Faf du Plessis’ charges, their target is 466 - colossal. So, the best they can do is resist and hope for rain. Indeed, they need to do what England did to them at this ground in 1995, but I can’t see any Mike Athertons floating around in this Proteas’ dressing room. We had a good old time on the OBO yesterday, let’s continue in that spirit throughout the morning do drop me a line or ping me a tweet. G’morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a5807d23ad1b44ef0a95750a9a75b97d48619c/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb477f1aeb4f479899bce46c9e5e40d1","title":"italy italian immersive language course learning holiday molise","story":"An immersive language course offers a glimpse of life and culture in little-known Molise and the skills to parlare away with the locals ‘Eccoci qua!” announces Fernando, pulling the minibus into the side of the road. Ahead of us, the hilltop town we have driven nearly three hours from Rome to reach shimmers in the late afternoon sun. Agnone is a picturesque settlement of some 5,000 inhabitants, all of whom – starting with Fernando, a local dairy farmer and occasional chauffeur – appear to have been sworn not to speak English to us.This isn’t hard, because the town is in Italy’s least-known province, Molise – a region so “undiscovered” that even the Italians have a standing joke, Il Molise non esiste. There are 10 of us – nine women and a man, from Australia, the US, the UK and France – and we are here for a total immersion language course called Live and Learn Italian.As its founder and director Jenifer Landor emphasises at our first evening together in an open-air pizzeria, it is not so much about the classes as the experience (lesson one: Italians think it’s weird to drink wine with pizza). Over the course of a week, this approach will take us up a mountain with artisanal baker Mercede and her devoted farm dog, and down into a 600-year-old wine cellar to sample Carlo’s wines, that are deemed so sensitive they are unable to travel beyond their home town (though he pours so generously that this is unlikely to be put to the test). We will make (and eat) ravioli in the kitchen of retired shoe-seller Maria, who has become a celebrated home cook, and meet up with the latest generation of the Di Nucci family, who forsook centuries of migratory shepherding – the transumanza – to set up a thriving cheese factory.We’re split into three groups on the basis of a written test and an interview with the three young teachers who will take charge of classroom tuition. It’s a little bit daunting but, as Landor says, it is to ensure nobody finds themselves bored or out of their depth. Complete beginners are discouraged from signing up, as they would miss out on the interaction with local people.“It’s up to you if you want to do the homework – you’re not schoolchildren,” she tells us. There’s a burst of ironic hilarity midway through the week when we discover the Italian for short cut (scorciatoia) but as my relatively advanced group quickly discovers, Italian is full of devilish prepositions and unlikely idioms, so it pays to do the legwork.Lessons take place each morning in an elegant former convent converted into a library and museum – its polished corridors flanked by rooms full of yellowing books. Only towards the end of the week do we discover a shuttered chamber containing a replica of the region’s most venerable artefact: La Tavola Osca. By now we are well-versed in the classical history of the area, having spent an afternoon being shown around an ancient amphitheatre carved into the hillside of a neighbouring settlement evocatively named Pietrabbondante.The original Osca (as it is affectionately called) is in the British Museum and is a small bronze tablet inscribed from right to left with the laws of the Samnite people, who ruled this part of Italy from the sixth century BC until the Roman empire took over. Their five tribes traded with Greece and worshipped Ulysses – and remains of their civilisation are still being dug out of the Molise hillsides. It is astonishing to sit on stone amphitheatre benches that Samnite stonemasons, chiselling away two centuries before Christ, smoothed into curves designed to mirror and support the human back – Italy’s first ergonomic seating, we are told.There is another copy of the Osca in the B\u0026ampB where four of us are staying – the family home of artist Tonina. Though she lives in a flat nearby, the four-storey house is full of her craftwork and her memories. She greets us each morning at a table groaning with breakfast delicacies – mounds of ricotta drizzled with a local liqueur, plates piled with cakes and bread, waiting to be slathered in homemade apricot and cherry jams. With the food comes the first of the day’s Italian conversation, for which we are sometimes joined by Tonina’s maths teacher sister: this isn’t a course for people with a limited appetite for carbs and chat any more than it’s for those who find walking a drag, though at least some of the breakfast calories are burned off by frequent yomps up and down Agnone’s cobbled streets.Nor is it a course for those with an aversion to being summoned by bells: Agnone is a town of 14 churches, most of them equipped with the massive clangers that are its claim to a niche sort of fame. The Marinelli bell foundry in the centre of town is said to be Italy’s oldest family business. Since the 14th century, the Marinellis have been sending their campane to churches and monasteries throughout the Catholic world, from Africa to South America. A video in its museum shows a succession of popes blessing the soon-to-be bells as sluice gates are opened to let moulten bronze surge infernally along channels in the foundry floor. It still makes 30 or more bells to order each year, and when we visit workers are about to crack open the latest huge clay cast. It’s a make-or-break moment that will reveal whether the painstakingly decorated bell will ring true or have to be fed back into the smelting vats.In the past, the town rang to the sound of gold-, iron- and coppersmiths, though almost all of the workshops are closed now – testament to the depopulation that recently led to Molise offering €700 a month for three years to anyone willing to live and set up a business in one of its smaller towns.There’s nothing much for young people to do here, sighs Tonina, though they all pile back for their summer holidays and the town’s historic winter warmer – the Ndocciata fire festival on Christmas Eve, which involves columns of men wearing necklaces of flaming sticks.Most people sign up to the course for two weeks, but by the end of just one I’m surprised to find myself chatting away a raffica, unabashed by my all-too-frequent errori – not least when I loudly mistake a fertility symbol carved into the amphitheatre for a bird that has lost a wing. (Without missing a beat, our guide finds a simpler synonym for phallus.)By the time we have rattled back to Rome in the minibus, several of us have come to an agreement: we’ll be back, but first we have to work off all those breakfasts.

She was earning $4.35 an hour carrying heavy trays and walking several miles a day – pumping breastmilk in the restaurant toilet when she could, and living in fear of her C-section scar reopening.“The biggest thing was that I was kind of scared. When you have major surgery like that and then you’re pushing your body so harshly,” said the mother of three from Bondurant, Iowa, who is remarkably phlegmatic about the experience.When she got home, Rebeschini would take over childcare duties from her husband Ron, 33, an optician, so he could go to work.“I remember every time I had to work I was like ‘please don’t reopen,’” she says of the scar on her abdomen. “I mean I was essentially risking my life.”Rebeschini’s experience is far from rare for America’s mothers. One in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to the advocacy group Paid Leave US (PL+US).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury.“If you look at paid leave rates between white families and families of colour, it’s even worse,” said Myra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at child development non-profit Zero to Three. “Parents just can’t afford to stay home with their babies.”Rebeschini, who left her previous job around a month before the birth, said financially she had no option but to work.Working shifts of up to 12 hours, she found the separation from her newborn agonising.“I would come home and the first thing I did was make sure that he was breathing … When you’re not physically there you just have to trust that he’s fine. You worry about the bond of being gone for so long … is he going to recognise you?” she said.She said she didn’t dare tell her new employer how recently she had given birth for fear of being considered a liability. While her manager was supportive of her pumping breastmilk, there was nowhere suitable to do it. “So I had to take my breast pump into the bathroom and hope that no one came in and saw me pumping.”Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence.Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon.Rebeschini has since had a third child, Brody, who is now one. This time, she took two months off, but with no maternity pay it resulted in the couple falling behind on bills and having to declare bankruptcy – delaying their plan to buy a home.“You can prepare all you want to be off for a certain time and not have pay but it just doesn’t work. If we had paid leave, we wouldn’t have fallen so far behind that we couldn’t get ourselves out of a hole. We wouldn’t have that stain on our credit.”Dr Rebecca Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said breastfeeding is one of the biggest challenges for women who return to work early – especially low-wage workers.“If you’re driving a bus, how do you stop that bus to pump milk?”After a C-section, she recommends women take eight weeks off and to avoid heavy activity to prevent complications. “A lot of women still have significant pain at two weeks after,” she said.Kirstin Moody, 36, a waitress from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, could only afford to take one week off after giving birth to her son Alex, now 13, by emergency C-section. The waitress ended up ripping her incision six times and as a result can no longer feel her lower stomach.“I would feel like I was on fire, like somebody would take a hot poker and just drag it across the bottom of my stomach,” Moody said. “I was on pain medication for some of the time but it generally doesn’t help because you don’t get to fully rest your body.”As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights. Parting with her newborn son was intolerable.“Oh God it was horrible. I cried and cried and I would sit at work and I would cry.”Paid family leave has gained broad support and looks set to become a policy point in the 2020 presidential election, though there are still disagreements in Washington on how to pay for it.In December the White House held a summit dedicated to the subject and recently passed a law to give 2.1 million federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave. So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own family leave bills.But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready.“On the politician front at least there’s progress,” said Jones-Taylor. “But any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that’s not good for mum, it’s not good for babies, and it’s really just not good for the workforce.”According to National Partnership for Women \u0026amp Families, the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children’s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems.Although some private companies are starting to catch up by offering paid family leave as a benefit, many women get around the inflexibility of the corporate world by starting their own businesses. But with no paid maternity leave, there is still pressure to go back to work.Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila.Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children.“Being a small business owner I felt that there was no other way that things were going to continue going without me and so it was more of a necessity than anything,” she said. “And then of course it impacts your income. So we have a new baby and we have three kids, to not work and not have that income would also impact our household.”Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy was back on the campaign trail knocking doors two weeks after giving birth by C-section to her now two-year-old twin sons Alex and Xander, who were born premature and spent four months in neonatal intensive care.“I had tremendous back pain, shoulder pain, and you have to think that you’re just coming out of major surgery where you are literally being sliced open and giving life to human beings, it takes a lot out of your body. But I was in a position where there was no time to rest, I didn’t have an option to relax.”Caroll Foy, 38, who was then still working as a public defender, was on disability benefits – which in some states can be used for pregnancy – so she was entitled to a portion of her income. But with she and her husband Jeffrey Foy, 38, a supervisor at a non-profit, taking cuts to their paycheque, their finances came under strain.It was such a wake-up call that she has introduced a paid family leave bill in Virginia. “When you’re bringing a new child into this world and you’re expanding your family, your income shrinks … I want to make sure that other women and families don’t have to make the same painful decisions about being with their newborn baby or paying for their bills and keeping a roof over their head.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d91760da2bd453ffc3473d039bd8b3171e4995/984_789_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=699f38eec0f8701597df4f68b9a2c92a","title":"kim jong uns aunt reappears six years after purge rumours","story":"Appearance of Kim Kyong-hui next to the North Korean leader at a performance puts paid to talk of execution Kim Jong-un’s aunt has appeared in public for the first time in more than six years, ending speculation that she had been purged or executed after helping her nephew establish himself as North Korea’s leader.The official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling party, the Rodong Sinmun, showed Kim Kyong-hui seated next to Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, at a performance to mark the lunar new year at a theatre in Pyongyang on Saturday.Her name was also mentioned in a report on the event by the KCNA state news agency.Rumours that Kim Kyong-hui had been sidelined, or possibly executed, gained traction after her influential husband, Jang Song-thaek, was executed by firing squad for treason and corruption in December 2013.Days after Jang’s death, state media named his wife as a member of the funeral committee for another senior official. But she was not present at a ceremony to mark the second anniversary, days later, of the death of her brother and Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, and her name had not been mentioned in KCNA dispatches until Sunday.Some observers believed she had become a victim of a series of purges her nephew ordered in an attempt to rid the ruling party of potential rivals. Others speculated that Kim Kyong-hui, a heavy drinker, had died due to ill health.The 73-year-old’s sudden appearance is being seen as a show of family unity as the regime seeks to pressure the US into making concessions to restart stalled denuclearisation talks.While she is unlikely to regain formal positions of political influence, her presence is hugely symbolic, according to Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Center in Washington.“The sudden appearance of major officials in a regime like North Korea’s is always massively important,” Madden told Agence France-Presse. “Even if she does not have a political office or formal position in the regime, making a personal appearance like this is a public demonstration of support for her nephew,” he added. “It is a strong expression of Kim family unity.”Before her absence from public life, Kim Kyong-hui – the youngest daughter of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung – was a four-star army general and politburo member.She is said to have been instrumental in grooming her nephew to succeed his father, who died from a heart attack in late 2011."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146929.1579625760!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plenty of politicians promises but what about these ideas to help consumers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBy taking  meaningful steps towards making education genuinely free, a future education minister would almost guarantee that his or her  name would be remembered for decadesElection manifestos have been coming thick and fast over recent days, and politicians have been falling over themselves to make promises that they say will make Ireland a better place for us all. Promises are great and all, but in this election – as in all elections – there are question marks over what can be delivered and what will be delivered.With that in mind, Pricewatch put on its thinking cap and tried to come up with some ideas that might make the lives of consumers better without costing us all billions of euro that we don’t really have.1. A consumer body with sharp teethWhile the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which came into being more than five years ago, has a role to play in protecting consumers and has had some successes, we can’t help but wonder if more could be done to fight the consumers’ corner.One of the most frequent complaints we get on this page about the consumer watchdog is that it can’t or won’t investigate and resolve complaints in an expeditious manner on behalf of inidual consumers.People ring the CCPC looking for help only to be told that there is nothing it can do. Then they contact us.The CCPC looks at big-picture things but will not help an inidual out if they have been let down by a service provider or a retailer or a bloke who promised to make your garden look amazing only to turn it into a muddy wasteland.In fact there is no organisation – either State or privately funded – that is dedicated to fighting your corner.So let’s change that. And let’s change it fast. If The  or the Ray Darcy Show or Joe Duffy can contact a big retailer or mobile phone operator when they let people down or mess them around and make sure they make amends, why can’t a consumer body funded by the State?Can Pricewatch let you in on a little secret? The page is able to make businesses help people they have let down in minutes not because we are particularly brilliant but because big businesses hate being publicly identified as useless. So let’s allow the new consumer watchdog to identify companies who let consumers down.And let it out them every week. It is simple to do. You get the complaint, you call the alleged rogue trader and give them a chance to resolve the situation, and then you highlight what they have done – or not done – to improve the consumer’s lot. You present both sides of the story, and let the public decide whether or not the business is one they can trust.Our dream consumer body would have people employed specifically to contact businesses on behalf of consumers. They could operate a bit like the food watchdog, a body which appears to have no problem shutting down shops and restaurants – even for a couple of hours – and then highlighting all the gross and sometimes minor ways such places have let their diners down.Of course there is no point in going to all the effort to fix people’s problems if you can’t boast about it, so our new watchdog should have a monthly magazine filled with interesting features on how to save money, independent and exhaustive product reviews, stories of how companies have got it wrong and got it right.In addition to the magazine, the new consumer organisation would also use the internet to reach out to people. It would blog, tweet and use Facebook and Instagram to fix people’s problems and empower people.2. Free at last One of the simplest things a new government could do to make the lives of all – or at least many – citizens of the State better would be to make public transport free. Obviously there are financial constraints at play here, so how about if it started by making all off-peak public transport free and free at all times for children? Imagine if you could travel on buses and trains at no cost between the hours of 10am and 5pm between Monday and Friday and then all day at weekends.Such a move would encourage more people to leave their cars at home if they were popping into town for a bit of a wander. It would also incentivise some commuters who travel at peak times to delay their journeys by a few minutes each day to save themselves a few bob – or in fact more than €1,000 a year. This would have the added benefit of reducing the overcrowding on public transport without the need to introduce more services and more carriages on trains.It could all be implemented a lot faster than Bus Connects or  North. Oh, and while this probably doesn’t matter a jot to politicians, any moves in this direction would also be wildly popular and something that we would be talking about 50 years from now.And while we are on the topic of transport, maybe the next minister for transport could introduced a system to allow all commuters pay their bus, train or tram fare by tapping their credit or debit card? The Leap card is pretty good but not everyone has one, and if we could get rid of the need to have the “exact change” when using public transport then more people could get on a bus on a whim, and our world would be a slightly better place.3. Honour education promises made years agoWe all know that education in Ireland is supposed to be free, but as a result of generations of governmental inaction and ineptitude and under-resourcing and simply not caring enough about it, sending children to school has ended up anything but free.Nearly 55 years ago the then minister for education Donogh O’Malley announced that education for all the State’s children at no cost was to become a constitutional obligation. That was brilliant. It never really happened, and since then Irish parents have collectively spent more than €20 billion on educating their young as O’Malley’s vision of free schooling quickly got lost in the mists of time.According to multiple surveys over many years, Irish parents are spending close to €1,000 per year on a child’s primary education, and around €1,500 on secondary education. It really doesn’t have to be like this.Irish schools – or most of them, at any rate – operate with a bizarre independence, and even though they are almost entirely funded by the taxpayer they are mostly controlled by boards of management who call the shots. The Department of Education can encourage schools to make changes, but under the rules as they stand it has to stop short of imposing changes.By ceding control of the schools to boards of management years back it meant the State did not have to deal with staffing issues – other than paying wages – or ongoing maintenance and the other fiddly (but incredible important) issues that our schools have to manageThe children’s charity Barnardos has estimated that it would cost about €20 million to provide free books for all children in primary school. While that may sound like a lot in the context of annual government spending, it is peanuts.Various education ministers have wrung their hands about the issue, most recently Richard Bruton. When he was in the hot seat a couple of years back he sent a so-called circular to all schools calling on authorities to adopt “principles of cost-effective practice”. Among the measures schools were asked to introduce were generic uniforms mandatory book-rental schemes a ban on workbooks iron-on or sew-on crests and the provision of lists of all items parents would have to buy for their children with indications of the likely costs at the best value stores.Of course they could ignore his circular if they so chose and many did which means it has not made a whole lot of difference to the costs faced by parents.Let’s pick just one thing. If schoolbook rental schemes were mandatory across all schools, parents could save a fortune. It is so simple. At the beginning of the school year parents would pay a rental fee to the school and the child would get their text books for free. At the end of the year if the books are returned unblemished, much of the fee would be returned. It is cheap and easy, and would save parents hundreds of millions of euro over the next few years,However, it needs the State to step in and manage the scheme like it does in Northern Ireland. The best thing is the savings would just keep coming for ever.Earlier this month the outgoing Minister for Education Joe McHugh said his department had taken the first step towards providing free schoolbooks at primary level with a €1 million pilot project which will benefit more than 15,000 pupils in more than 100 disadvantaged primary schools.Not a lot done, a lot more to do, then.Oh, and again this probably won’t make much difference to any politicians seeking high office.Yet by taking some meaningful steps towards making education genuinely free, a future education minister would almost guarantee that his or her name would be remembered and would still be appearing in print for decades after they die in much the same way as O’Malley’s is.4. On your bikeThere is a short stretch of O’Connell Street in Dublin that typifies all that is wrong with successive governments’ approach to cycling. On the Clery’s side of the country’s main thoroughfare – from Abbey Street to O’Connell Bridge – there is a cycle lane that is cut off from car traffic by a series of fluorescent plastic poles. After about 30m the somewhat safe zone suddenly ends.For around four glorious seconds a city cyclist is allowed to feel just a bit more secure. For the rest of the time they have to compete for road with buses, cabs and cars. It is tokenism at its worst, and by any measure it is simply absurd.When it comes to cycling it is not the only thing that is absurd, mind you. It has now taken more than six years for the powers that be to work out how to run a safe cycle lane down the north quays from Heuston Station to the East Link bridge. Lads, it’s a straight line. There is no need to tie yourself up in knots over it? And there is certainly no need to draw up convoluted plans that try to reroute traffic through recently built apartment blocks. Yes, they actually did that.So, maybe the future powers that be could invest some money in sensible solutions that would make cycling safer and as a result more popular. Here’s an idea for starters. Rather than having cycling lanes that can be easily invaded by cars why not separate the small bit of road given to bikes and the big bit of road given to cars with a concrete “ardmadillo” – a slightly elevated thing that stops cars weaving where they have no right to weave. Pricewatch can’t imagine such a step would take too long or cost too much.Oh, and when it comes to cycling there is some other simple things that could be done.The Fianna FáilGreen Party coalition that came before the two successive Fine Gael-led ones did not exactly cover itself in glory when it came to managing the finances of the country. And, yes, we are being kind here. Yet one thing that administration did leave us with was the cycle-to-work tax incentive scheme.It covers bicycles and accessories up to a maximum of €1,000. You probably know how it works. Your employer buys the bike stuff and you pay for it, tax-free, over 12 months. It effectively knocks about 40 per cent off the price. But why not make it better? Why not incentivise more people to cycle by giving them twice the tax break.And while we are on the topic of better, cheaper and more environmentally friendly commuting, can we please legalise e-scooters? Impose restrictions on them for sure and punish those who use them recklessly by confiscating their little machines forever, but for heaven’s sake do something more than commission reports that never see the light of day.5. Save our shopsOver recent years shops that have served generations of Irish people have closed at a pace which only seems to be accelerating. When they close people mourn their passing despite the fact that they may not have visited those shops and spent money there even once in the last decade.Many closures are as a result of the migration of much of our spending online, and there isn’t a whole lot the political class can do to stop that. But if we want to protect indigenous retailers and keep small shops open in communities big and small across the country then we have to do more than wring our hands and express sadness when they close.Maybe grants could be made available to local retailers to develop online presences of their own or modernise their stores? Maybe rates and ludicrous upward-only rent reviews could be challenged?Maybe we could take a leaf out of our continental cousins’ retail playbook. Some parts of the EU, including France, Germany and Luxembourg, restrict when shops can go into sale. Strictly-imposed rules mean shops can only offer discounted stock for four weeks in January and four weeks during the summer. The rules protect smaller retailers who struggle to compete with the internet and big multinational fast-fashion chains that can buy in bulk and offer deep discounts almost year round if allowed to better lure people through their doors.6. And there’s more . . . a whole lot moreMaybe the next government could look at ways to give parents more of a break when it comes to childcare costs that can easily top more than two grand a month for two young children?Maybe we could see more parks in urban spaces to improve the quality of life of people living in apartments around our towns and cities? Such a move might encourage higher density city living – the like of which is common across Europe – which would reduce congestion on our roads, and maybe cut the endless commuting times many people have to endure five days a week. It would also serve to lessen our reliance on cars, and go some small way towards reducing our carbon footprint.Oh, and perhaps more could be done to tackling the motor insurance sector which has been getting away with making customers pay through the nose for years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4152194.1580071631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one in four primary school children cannot run properly study says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“If children don’t have a solid foundation of basic movement skills how can we expect them to do more complex skills as part of organised sport?”  Photograph: Getty ImagesOne in four primary school children cannot run properly and lack basic movement skills, according to a new study.In addition, one in two children cannot kick a ball properly, and less than one in every five can throw a ball.The research found “fundamental movement skills” – running, jumping, catching and kicking – plateau and stop progressing when children reach the age of 10.The findings are contained in a study by researchers at Dublin City University (DCU), who have carried out an all-Ireland study of over 2,000 primary school children.Dr Stephen Behan of DCU said the study was the most comprehensive of its kind ever produced in Ireland, and highlighted the poor levels of basic skills in Irish children.“If children don’t have a solid foundation of basic movement skills how can we expect them to do more complex skills as part of organised sport?” he said. “This solid foundation is what allows children to take part in a multitude of physical activities, and to feel confident in trying new things.” Existing research shows that mastery of these basic skills is achievable by eight years of age.This milestone is considered significant as children who do not reach it risk exhibiting an aversion to engaging in sports and physical activity, particularly in their teenage years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4152166.1580069111!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 campaign enters decisive week","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrances Fitzgerald and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar out canvassing in Dundrum with Fine Gael colleague Josepha Madigan.

Indeed a coronavirus case was recently confirmed in his apartment block.But when he called the NHS 111 helpline, as suspected carriers have been advised to do, the answer was unexpected.Instead of being called in immediately for a test, he says he was asked only if he had “the sniffles”. When he replied in the negative, the specialist on the other end of the line told him to call back if he started feeling unwell. With that, the conversation was over.On Sunday, Mr Marland, 34, learned that the advice given to him may simply have been wrong. In a surprise announcement, Chinese officials suggested that carriers of coronavirus can actually spread the disease for up to two weeks without displaying any symptoms. If the Chinese are right, Mr Marland fears he and other potential carriers might be unwittingly carrying the deadly virus, and potentially spreading it to the public. Even his own relatives have asked him to stay away for fear of contracting the disease themselves.“I’m potentially a risk to other people,” he told the .“I’m still within the two week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms.”“I live five minutes from the Wuhan fish market, and I walk through it every day. It\u0027s not a nice place, full of chickens and dead hedgehogs. There was a confirmed case of coronavirus in my apartment block.“I knew I had to call the NHS as soon as I got back to the UK, and a specialist called me back. They asked if I had the sniffles. I said no, and they said ‘If you start having any sniffles, or any of your family do, then please call us back.’“It was like they were just ticking boxes. It feels like they are leaving the door open to this thing. I don\u0027t understand why they haven’t tested me, just to be on the safe side. I need to be checked out properly.” NHS sources pointed out on Sunday night that 111 operators had correctly followed official advice from Public Health England, which holds overall responsibility for stopping the spread of the disease.Mr Marland, a British national who works as mathematics co-ordinator at the Wuhan China Britain School, returned to the UK on January 17, after travelling through the Chinese city of Shenzhen, on to Hong Kong, and then via Dubai to Gatwick Airport.At no point was he checked or tested for signs of coronavirus, he said. The  spoke to Mr Marand on his mobile phone, as he was travelling by train from London to his family home in West Wycombe, Bucks.“Maybe I should be staying away from people, but no one has told me to,” he said.“They haven’t given me any advice at all. I’m just getting on with my life - what else am I supposed to do?”Security personnel checks the temperature of journalists before the State Council Information OfficeWhether Public Health England will change the official advice remains to be seen. A senior PHE source said last night that until UK officials saw hard evidence that the Chinese discovery is correct, the policy will remain the same.Officials still believe that the overall risk to the public remains low, but are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan.As concern grew, it emerged on Sunday that NHS trusts have been issued guidance on how to safely dispose of dead bodies.A public health hub has been set up in Heathrow, staffed by a rotating team of seven clinicians working in shifts to support patients on arrival.Meanwhile Britons trapped in the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so.Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Government was looking at all options to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials were considering airlifts from the city.Dr Yvonne Griffiths, 71, was visiting the China as part of a three-week education trip when she was caught up in the outbreak.The Birmingham City University lecturer said: “There\u0027s absolutely no information coming from any source when the lockdown will finish and when the public transport will reopen, so that\u0027s a concern.People wear facemasks while commuting on a trainPeople wear facemasks while commuting on a trainOther countries across the world were also racing to prevent a pandemic after cases were confirmed outside China, including in Thailand, Australia, and three cases in the United States.In France, three patients confirmed to have caught the virus are doing \u0027”very well,” according the France\u0027s director-general of health Jerome Salomon.However, Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo announced that the Chinese Lunar New Year parade in the city - where two are infected - was being cancelled as a “precaution.” Coronavirus everything you need to know puff\u0027Yesterday, I met members of the Chinese community in Paris who themselves wished to cancel the procession” in Republique square, the mayor said.On Sunday night the French government announced citizens would be evacuated from the affected province. Authorities in China have cancelled a host of events marking New Year as they expand their lockdown against the virus, while people in Beijing have been advised no to shake hands to prevent the disease spreading.A Public Health England spokesman said: “There is no evidence that any travellers with the virus have arrived in the UK.

Prof Neil Ferguson, public health expert at Imperial College London, estimated that around 100,000 people globally may be infected with the virus. The NHS said on Sunday that of at least 2,000 people suspected in recent weeks to have travelled to the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, only 52 have been tested for coronavirus. All have returned negative results.But David Marland, a mathematics teacher who has lived in Wuhan for the past decade, revealed that he had not been offered a test despite walking through the seafood market suspected to be the source of the epidemic nearly every day.British national David Marland, 34, maths co-ordinator at a school in Wuhan, China.  Mr Marland claims he has not been tested for Coronavirus despite visiting the seafood market at the centre of the epidemic every day before leaving for the UKInstead, after he called the NHS 111 helpline shortly after returning to the UK last week, a specialist asked only if he or his family members “had the sniffles”.When he replied that he felt healthy, the specialist told him to call back if he began to feel unwell.On Sunday night Mr Marland, 34, told the  that he might be unwittingly carrying the disease, and accused health officials of putting the public in danger.“I’m potentially a risk to other people,” he said. “I’m still within the two week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms.”Deadly coronavirus reaches Europe: in picturesA senior NHS source confirmed on Sunday that patients who called the 111 service had not been offered tests unless they displayed signs of the disease.“Our specialists followed the official advice from Public Health England to the letter,” the source said.Chinese officials said they had discovered that coronavirus is infectious in its incubation period - before symptoms show - making it harder to contain. As concern grew over the spread of coronavirus, it emerged yesterday that NHS trusts have been issued guidance on how to safely dispose of dead bodies.Meanwhile Britons trapped in the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so.Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Government was looking at all options to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials were considering airlifts from the city.It was reported last night that plans to evacuate Britons from Wuhan are being thwarted by Beijing. According to The Times, the Foreign Office was awaiting permission for citizens to be repatriated to the UK.  On Sunday night the French government announced citizens would be evacuated from the affected province. Authorities in China have cancelled a host of events marking New Year as they expand their lockdown against the virus.A public health hub has been set up in Heathrow, staffed by a rotating team of seven clinicians working in shifts to support patients on arrival.A Public Health England spokesman said: “There is no evidence that any travellers with the virus have arrived in the UK. There are no confirmed cases in the UK, and based on current evidence the risk to the UK population is low.”John Bolton facing fresh calls to testify in impeachment trial amid claims Trump wanted to withhold Ukraine aidBrexit latest news: Leo Varadkar compares trade talks to football and claims he\u0026#39s on the \u0026#39stronger team\u0026#39Surge in prisoners serving life sentences makes overcrowding \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to end, says Cambridge studyThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Kobe Bryant, NBA legend, killed along with daughter in California helicopter crashChinese premier Li Keqiang in Wuhan to lead emergency efforts as coronavirus deaths in China rise to 80  Monday morning news briefing: Kobe Bryant killed in air crashCouncils put climate emergency ahead of tackling deadly pollution, says studyComment: The baguette is on the brink, but the mushroom shows the way to a culinary comebackComment: As the Holocaust fades from living memory, it is more urgent than ever to teach its lessonsDuchess of Cambridge inspired by Anne Frank for Holocaust portraitsMatteo Salvini’s League party \u0026#39narrowly defeated in key regional elections\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s sovereignty at risk if it allows Huawei to access 5G network, US Secretary of State warnsIn-car technology better at keeping older drivers safer on roads than mass retesting, study suggestsBritain\u0026#39s biggest cruise operator is becoming \u0026#39Butlins on Sea\u0026#39, Which? survey findsUS embassy in Baghdad hit by rocket attack We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 27 january 2020","story":"An Indian Sashastra Seema Bal paramilitary soldier exhales as he participates in a parade to mark Republic Day in Gauhati, IndiaBrexit latest news: Leo Varadkar compares trade talks to football and claims he\u0026#39s on the \u0026#39stronger team\u0026#39Surge in prisoners serving life sentences makes overcrowding \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to end, says Cambridge studyThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Kobe Bryant, NBA legend, killed along with daughter in California helicopter crashChinese premier Li Keqiang in Wuhan to lead emergency efforts as coronavirus deaths in China rise to 80  Monday morning news briefing: Kobe Bryant killed in air crashCouncils put climate emergency ahead of tackling deadly pollution, says studyComment: The baguette is on the brink, but the mushroom shows the way to a culinary comebackComment: As the Holocaust fades from living memory, it is more urgent than ever to teach its lessonsDuchess of Cambridge inspired by Anne Frank for Holocaust portraitsMatteo Salvini’s League party \u0026#39narrowly defeated in key regional elections\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s sovereignty at risk if it allows Huawei to access 5G network, US Secretary of State warnsIn-car technology better at keeping older drivers safer on roads than mass retesting, study suggestsBritain\u0026#39s biggest cruise operator is becoming \u0026#39Butlins on Sea\u0026#39, Which? survey findsUS embassy in Baghdad hit by rocket attack Scottish Tory leadership candidate calls for Unionist party pact at Holyrood electionSuspected coronavirus carriers coming to the UK may have been wrongly told they don\u0026#39t need to be testedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/17/08/Christine-Lagarde.jpg","title":"ecb central bank climate chaneg inflation christine lagarde","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is time... to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0027\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde saysThe European Central Bank has launched a strategic review that could see it use monetary policy to\u0026nbsptackle\u0026nbspthe climate emergency. The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since the so-called \u0027 fish ball revolution\u0027 riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people\u0027s resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product. Despite this, in 2012, local media Apple Daily reported that 375,000,000 fish balls were consumed per dayA vendor arranges fried insects on her street food cart on Khao San Road in Bangkok.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley.

Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has taken 10 years of expert design and development, parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation to get to this point. No other major projects are within at least five years of being where HS2 is today, and upgrades to the existing network cannot deliver the same benefits.“The UK construction sector, the companies working on the project, and those relocating to cities along the route, and the civic leaders in the Midlands and north eager to benefit from the investment\u0026nbspHS2 will bring to their regions are all united in support for HS2 being built as soon as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This can’t be delivered by tinkering around the edges or with short-term fixes.”Long-Bailey is not ‘continuity Corbyn’ candidate, Unite boss insistsThe proposal of a federal structure is one previously put forward by Mr Brown,\u0026nbspalthough the idea dates back to Winston Churchill more than a century ago.Sir Keir,\u0026nbspwho abandoned campaigning for four days after his mother-in-law suffered a serious accident,\u0026nbspwill not set out the details of the new structure, or of the powers to be devolved.Instead, he will call for the UK to follow other developed nations by drawing up a new written constitution, which would be devised by the “great and good”\u0026nbspin a constitutional convention.The idea is partly aimed at heading off the increasing\u0026nbsppossibility\u0026nbspof Scottish independence after Brexit, but also at recognising the desire of people across the UK for greater control of their lives, previously displayed in the vote to leave the EU.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

Hartlepool MP Mike Hill was this week revealed to be facing sexual assault and harassment claims, which he denies, in an employment tribunal.A new policy on dealing with sexual harassment allegations was adopted last year, following the publication of a #LabourToo dossier containing 43 anonymised stories of harassment within the party.Asked\u0026nbspabout the party’s handling of sexual harassment complaints, Ms Allin-Khan said: “I do know what it’s like to face harassment like that in the workplace\u0026nbspin my life – not in politics, in a previous work life – and it is horrific.“You dread coming to work every day.

He is highly-regarded by both left-wingers and centrists in the party. As Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, he played a key role in the party’s eventual backing of a second referendum. A key ally of the current left-wing leadership of the party, the Salford \u0026amp Eccles MP is viewed in some quarters as the natural successor to Mr Corbyn and describes herself as a “proud socialist”. Highly regarded by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. She won also won plaudits for her performance filling in for Corbyn both at prime minister’s questions and during the general election debates.Corbyn’s constituency neighbour and friend, Emily Thornberry, has been critical of the party’s Brexit stance, but has remained loyal to the leadership and has represented the Labour Party on various overseas visits. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has joined the contest for deputy leadership of the party. After ruling herself out of running for the leadership, the Ashton-under-Lynne MP launched her bid for deputy warning that Labour faces the biggest challenge in its history and must win or die.

Ian Murray, the party’s only Scottish MP, is also standing.The shadow sports minister\u0026nbspadmitted she was the least well-known candidate, but was still brimming with optimism and enthusiasm about the campaign.\u0026nbsp“I don’t believe in the word impossible,” she said.Labour leadership hustings cancelled as Starmer halts campaigningThornberry denies sneering at Brexit votersLeadership is hard- as the Labour candidates are suddenly finding outLisa Nandy’s attack on New Labour gives her a chance of victoryNandy attacks Blair’s New Labour for maintaining ‘Thatcher consensus’Raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs to support her family, Ms Allin-Khan said her experience of growing up in poverty made her “incredibly relatable” to people struggling across the country.She has spoken of how a Labour government transformed her life, allowing her to study medicine at Cambridge despite failing her A-levels the first time around due to problems at home.Ms Allin-Khan, who also spent years delivering humanitarian aid in places such as Gaza, said: “There are people who are living lives that I’m very familiar with, unfortunately, and that gives me a fire in my belly that is almost impossible to replicate if you haven’t experienced cold and hunger and that loss of hope.”Factionalism and infighting within Labour only risk letting down communities that need the party most, she said, pointing to disunity as a factor in Labour’s election defeat.“When I was growing up, and we had one heater, which we moved from room to room, we didn’t care whether someone was left, right or centre,” Ms Allin-Khan said.“We just knew we needed a Labour government.”When December’s election result came in, she said she felt sick at the loss of so many colleagues and the scale of the defeat.But Ms Allin-Khan\u0026nbsprealised quickly she had to dust herself off to help Labour rebuild or risk the door closing “on an entire future generation of children and young people”.Starmer urged to ‘stand aside’ so Labour can have first woman leaderEither the\u0026nbspleader or the deputy of the party should be a woman, she argued, but she believed that a team of the best candidates was critical\u0026nbspto help\u0026nbspLabour out of “a difficult place”.Ms Allin-Khan, who is of Polish and Pakistani descent, would also like to see more ersity in the top jobs but said\u0026nbsp“we may not end up with that in this case”.Asked whether it should be someone outside of London, she said: “I think that the leadership, regardless of where they were born or live now or the seats they represent will be, and have to be willing to work across the whole country for the best interests of the whole country.”If elected, Ms Allin-Khan said she would continue to do shifts at St George’s Hospital in Tooting when she can – but admits she would be busy with her work as an MP and as a mother-of-two.She said: “An A\u0026ampE waiting rooms is like a microcosm of society. It’s all there in technicolour. You see the effects of poor social housing, of lack of job opportunities, cuts to the health service, it’s all there. “And that gives me credible argument, particularly when fighting for the NHS.”The new leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party will be announced on 4 April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was the first time since August 2019 that it had registered above 50 points, which marks the line between expansion and contraction.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIHS\u0026nbspMarkit\u0027s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said: “It seems likely that the rise kills off the prospect of an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England, with policymakers taking a wait-and-see approach as they assess the performance of the economy in the post-Brexit environment.The results of the survey, which is based on reports from managers in offices and factories, were the highest in 16 months and signalled a moderate expansion of business activity across the UK private-sector economy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu. Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”.

All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54).

The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

announced they would be evacuating citizens from Wuhan ​by plane\u0026nbspwithin days.Behind the scenes, Downing Street has accepted that some form of airlift will be necessary if the trapped Britons are to leave, but appeared some way from reaching an agreement with the Chinese authorities.One source described the issue as being “how” they are evacuated, not whether, and acknowledged the challenge of trying to reach people spread out across a wide area.“We are talking about hundreds of people in the province, rather than just in Wuhan city itself,” the source told The Independent.However, ministers are encouraged by the news on the domestic front, with all 52 people so far tested for the virus in the UK found to have negative results.Only the best news in your

But he added: “What we don’t know is how far it’s going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities.”China’s national health commission revealed the disease’s ability to spread is getting stronger and infections could continue to rise. A handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States, France and Canada, although no fatalities have been recorded outside China.The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\u0026nbspBritons urged to leave Wuhan but ministers won\u0027t commit to airliftsFrance to evacuate citizens from China’s Wuhan amid coronavirus fearsLatest China travel updates as coronavirus outbreak worsensCoronavirus: Hong Kong protesters set fire to planned quarantine buildIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.Health minister Ma Xiaowei said the virus can be infectious during its incubation period – before symptoms show – which ranges from one to 14 days.China has temporarily banned live animal trade across the country in markets, supermarkets, restaurants and online.Any place breeding wildlife should be isolated\u0026nbspand the transportation of wildlife should be suspended, the country’s market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement. It comes after the virus was traced to a seafood market in Wuhan believed to have been illegally selling live animals.The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) director-general was on his way to Beijing to confer with Chinese officials and health experts about the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday.In a tweet, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he wanted to “strengthen our partnership” with China “in providing further protection against the outbreak”.\u0026nbspThe Geneva-based WHO also said editors of major scientific journals had agreed to share any papers about the new coronavirus with it before publication, with authors’ consent, and that this would help inform its assessment and guidance.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her.

But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

near the modern nations southern border, in .The site was already the location of  dilapidated buildings, which had previously housed soldiers and workers.After annexing that region of Poland during the early stages of World War Two, by April  the Nazi regime needed somewhere to house to Polish political prisoners, with local jails full.The majority of local residents were evicted to make way for German citizens, and Jewish workers from Oświęcim were forced to lay the foundations of the camp.A month after plans were approved, the first prisoners arrived at the initial camp, Auschwitz I, and within a year over , people were imprisoned there.When it was complete, it held around , inmates in appallingly cramped conditions, with numbers sometimes rising above ,.Above the gates, like other Nazi death camps, was the famous motto Arbeit macht frei – Work brings freedom.In October , with the German war in the East wreaking terrible loss of le, construction began for a second larger camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, in the village of Brzezinka three kilometres way.On the original plans for the huge facility, SS architect Karl Bischoff set the capacity for each cramped barracks at  – this

where the majority of Auschwitz prisoners were murdered on an industrial scale as the Holocaust plunged horrying depths.In October  a third camp, Auschwitz III, began housing prisoners at Monowitz around seven kilometres from the original site.There were also over  sub-camps in the surrounding areas, creating a vast, heavily-guarded complex enclosed by barbed wire fences and patrolled by thousands of SS troops.The camp was liberated on January , , by the rapidly advancing Soviet troops – the date is now commemorated each year as Holocaust Memorial Day.The Soviet Army liberated the remaining , prisoners from the camps.The sheer scale of mass murder involved in the Holocaust means its impossible to calculate a precise figure.In total, an estimated . million people were sent to Auschwitz – and at least . million of these died.Around % of the dead were Jewish, representing approximately a sixth of all Jews killed in the Holocaust.The rest of the inmates were comprised of Polish and Soviet prisoners, thousands of Romany people and an unknown number imprisoned for being homosexual.When the mass killings were at their peak, up to , Jews were being gassed per day, with the cyanide-based pesticide Zyklon B the weapon of choice.Those not killed in the gas chambers perished from starvation, forced labour and the infectious diseases that spread unchecked through the camps.The quality of le at Auschwitz was appalling – a true hell on earth.When they werent being worked to death, inmates were crammed together in unhygienic, inhumane conditions, and lived with the constant threat of punishment or torture at the hands of the SS guards.Furthermore, prisoners were subjected to degrading, often fatal medical experiments at the hands of twisted doctors such as the notorious Josef Mengele.With the Nazis rapidly losing ground against the Soviet Red Army in the latter stages of the war, Auschwitz was evacuated and much of it demolished.At the start of  the remaining prisoners were forced westwards into a death march, with many thousands perishing in the harsh winter conditions.Since June , Auschwitz has been open as a poignant museum devoted to the memories of those who lost their lives in the camp.Over a million people visit every year, with the exhibitions housed in many of the camps original buildings.Auschwitz has been a protected UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site since , and admission to the grounds of the memorial is free of charge.However, there are fees in place for guided tours and for renting headphone audio guides.Visitors

Friday’s orchestrated celebrations of a Brexit not yet done and Britain remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union during ’s dangerous £billion trade talks will distract momentarily from the growing unease but prove no permanent ersion. Wiser Tory heads worry that Johnson thinks Downing Street is a grander version of London’s City Hall, where as Mayor he spent his time posing for photographs and squandering public money on vanity buses and an unbuilt garden bridge, stealing other people’s credit for the London  Olympics. Older Tory heads compare – unfavourably – Johnson’s early weeks, including a fortnight’s holiday in Mustique, to the Labour bundle of energy that was Tony Blair here, there and everywhere on his  debut. Early impressions count. HS, Huawei, climate emergencies and Whitehall upheaval are splitting a party incapable of remaining united outside election time. Include a slouching economy, an ailing NHS given a plaster instead of the required transfusion and another round of school cuts... and the bleak picture that emerges is nothing like the pretty fiction Johnson painted in December.  Add a dash of resentment over posh weirdo misfit adviser Dominic Cummings’ Mafioso act and the mix is political Kryptonite.

We just waited there for an hour-and-a-half – all this time the ambulance couldn’t go anywhere , of course, she explained. “We were there that long they asked uswe wanted a cup of tea and a biscuit. “My dad was in pain and he’d only had paracetamol at home and it wasn’t having much of an effect. “I appreciate there were people in more need of urgent care but it’s worrying the NHS is struggling so much and that the response from staff seemed to be that it wasn’t that uncommon,” she continued. At about .pm Mr Koerber was taken into a bay in the hospital and had some tests done and he was sent for an x-ray. Karen, of Barrow upon Soar, near  Loughborough, said it took so long for the X-ray to be done she thinks they had forgotten us. “After the x-ray the bay we had been in was being used so they put dad in a corridor with other people on trolleys.” Karen waited in the corridor with her father until .pm, assuming he given a bed imminently, particularly considering he had not slept the night before due to knee pains. But at .am the next day Mr Koerber called his daughter to say he was still on the trolley. Karen said: “He was absolutely exhausted.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTwo grieving mums are demanding answers over the mystery deaths of their sons they believe were murdered. Norah Connelly and  Stephanie Bonner were strangers when their sons Jonathan and Rhys died within days of each other in Glasgow last year, but theyaposve joined forces to put pressure on the police. The devastated women believe their boys could have met violent ends but are frustrated the police have never declared their deaths as murders. They fear the cases have been pushed down the pecking order and could be eventually forgotten, reports the Daily Record. “Our sons’ killers are out there and people know who and why. Don’t let something like this happen to you. Help us get justice for our boys, said Norah and Stephanie in a joint statement. Nineteen-year-old Rhysapos body was found half naked on August  after disappeared from the Balanark area of Glasgow on July . The Celtic fan had told his mum he going to to watch a football match with his dad but he never turned up. Family and friends launched a social media campaign to find the teenager before he was found in marsh land near the village of Gartloch. While Jonathan, a twin with learning dficulties, had been missing a week when his body was found in the water at Spiers Wharf on July . The -year-old had injuries to his head and body, and had gone missing after going into the town centre to speak to his employers about why his wages had not been paid.  The two mums both believe the initial missing persons reports were not taken seriously by police and think vital evidence may have been lost. Family members instead carried out their own investigations in a desperate bid to try and get some answers. “I just need to know what happened to my boy, said mum-of-five Stephanie. He was . I have no doubt my son was murdered. I need answers. We all miss him so much.” Norah, who has two daughters, said: “Whoever put Johnny in that canal did it to make it look like a suicide. My son would never have left me alone. Le is empty for us all now. I know Johnny was assaulted before he died. I will never give up searching for answers.” She waited two days after he disappeared before contacting police and said from that moment on she felt asher le has been destroyed.  Stephanie said: “I knew as only a mother would that something terrible had happened to Rhys. I put it on Facebook askinganyone had seen him. I heard he was seen with an older woman and we told the police this but they did nothing so me and my sister went to her house and she denied even knowing Rhys. “It took the police two weeks to search where his body was found and, even months later, I’m still not sure of the exact location but he was found half-naked, with his clothes about  yards away. “His baseball cap was discovered in a common stair and had been washed. The shorts he was wearing that day have never been found. “They didn’t have any forensics out they just put him in a van and took him away. They said they wouldn’t get any forensics due to theof time. It took them seven weeks to formally identy him.” Stephanie said her own probed uncovered CCTV of her tragic son with a woman but she said police took days to check the footage despite her pleas.  She said: “During those seven weeks, I still kept praying it wasn’t him but I knew deep down. I knew my boy was gone. I have prayed for justice, for answers. This has broken my family. It has consumed my le. I promised Rhys when he was lying in his coffin I would get answers for him and I would get justice. It’s all I can do for my son. We’re all shattered.” “Rhys was a cheeky but loveable teenager with his whole le ahead. His disappearance and death should have been taken more seriously. I feel let down by the police. Nobody from Police Scotland has been helping me. I’ve been forced to seek the answers myself. “It’s soul destroying. I can’t let this happen to anyone . My boy, our boys, deserve more. I beg anyone who may have information to speak to the police or call in anonymously. “Someone must know what happened to my son. His brothers and sisters miss him – we all do.” Norah said she is clinging to the hope an appeal by police for witnesses will unlock vital information in the hunt for her Johnny’s attackers. “It’s taken all this time for police to put out an appeal. When Johnny went missing and his body was found, my ex-husband made a video retracing his steps, she continued.  “They had Johnny on CCTV walking until he got to the underpass at Spiers Wharf. Johnny had learning dficulties and no sense of danger. If someone spoke to him, he’d chat back not realisinghe was in danger. “It breaks my heart to think my boy would be alive todayhe’d been paid his wages when he should have been. He wouldn’t have gone into town, he’d have stayed local and met up with his friends. “The police don’t know how he ended up in the water but whoever attacked him did it to make it look like suicide. We still don’t know how Johnny died. He’d been in the water too long. Evidence was lost. “The police weren’t helping which is why we put out videos and put up information and appeals on social media. “Johnny was a family man. We were very close. His twin sister, Norah, and his big sister Michelle miss him so much – his dad as well. None of us can have peace until we know what happened to him.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge has captured the inner strength of Holocaust survivors in photographs to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.   She has made it her mission to help break the cycle of damaged children becoming damaged adults in Britain but in this new photographic project Kate encountered grandparents who had endured the most horric of childhood traumas and come through incredible adversity to live fulfilled lives. Inspired by the story of Anne Frank and the pictures of th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, the future Queen, one of several photographers involved in the project, took portraits of two survivors with their children and grandchildren and described them as “two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet”.   Each of the portraits, which will be published on Monday to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, depicts the special connection between a survivor and younger relatives carrying their legacy. They are designed to encourage everyone in Britain to perpetuate and share the memory of the horrors inflicted by the Nazis. One of Kate’s portraits was of -year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. He is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged  and .  Her other portrait is of -year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust. She is pictured with her -year-old granddaughter Chloe Wright. Kate, , who is patron of the Royal Photographic Society and a keen amateur snapper, said: The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. Yet it is so often through the most unimaginable adversity that the most remarkable people flourish. Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. They look back on their experiences with sadness, but also with gratitude that they were some of the lucky few to make it through. Their stories will stay with me forever. Whilst I have been lucky enough to meet two of the now very few survivors, I recognise not everyone in the future will be able to hear these stories first hand. It is vital that their memories are preserved and passed on to future generations, so that what they went through will never be forgotten.  One of the most moving accounts I read as a young girl was The Diary of Anne Frank, which tells a very personal reflection of le under Nazi occupation from a childaposs perspective. Her sensitive and intimate interpretation of the horrors of the time was one of the underlying inspirations behind the images. I wanted to make the portraits deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the le that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the s. The families brought items of personal signicance with them which are included in the photographs. It was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Stevenaposs memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation. The Duchess, a history of art graduate, said her photographic style in these portraits was inspired by Vermeer, whose domestic interior scenes of middle class le display a signature pearly light and draw the eye into the picture using carefully placed objects. Her photo of Yvonne features her German ID card, dated March , , which has a letter ‘J’ for Jew stamped on it. There is also a treasured brooch, bought for Yvonne by her daughter. It was made by the jewellery firm founded by her great-grandfather before it was taken over by the Nazis. Steven and his granddaughters included particularly poignant items in his portrait by Kate. They included a pan which his mother kept with them to cook extra morsels of food throughout their time in the camps, and a tomato from his garden. When Steven was in the Theresienstadt camp as a child, he helped another prisoner grow tomatoes. “He had picked out the pips from rotten tomatoes and grew his own. I became his little helper, watering these tomatoes,” Steven said. “He showed me how to pick out the side shoots so they grow straight, then when he was sent off to a camp in Poland, he asked me to look after his plants. “I was so proud to be asked - I was only eight years old. Since the war I have grown tomatoes at home in the greenhouse and every time I water them I think of this man. I don’t even know his name. I still feel  years on that I’m watering his tomato plants for him. When the tomatoes are out now the grandchildren come over and help to pick them.” The portraits will be part of a new exhibition which will open later this year, bringing together  powerful images of survivors and their family members to mark  years since the end of the Holocaust.  Two other portraits, by distinguished photographers Jillian Edelstein and Frederic Aranda, are released today to announce the project - a collaboration between the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Jewish News, and the Royal Photographic Society. Other images featuring in the exhibition will be taken by fellows of the Royal Photographic Society. In a photograph by Frederic Aranda, Joan Salter, , who fled the Nazis as a young child, appears with her husband Martin and her daughter Shelley. John Hajdu, , who survived the Budapest Ghetto, is in a portrait with his four-year-old grandson Zac photographed by Jillian Edelstein.

According to a former confidante of the -year-old yoga teacher, Doria silently influenced the shocking choice by Meghan and Prince Harry. In a deal which will see them spend a majority of their time in Canada with son Archie, they will not use their HRH titles, will no longer formally represent the Queen and will not receive public funds for royal duties. In addition they will repay £.million used to do refurbish  Frogmore Cottage – the Windsor home they will continue to use when in the UK. The confidante told Mail Online that Doria had grown close to Harry who described her as amazing shortly after the couple got engaged. They said they believe she has most definitely been giving the couple advice during the current drama. They said: When Meghan and Harry announced they were walking away from their jobs as Royals to be financially independent, it immediately smacked of Doria. Being financially independent has always been important to her. Harry in particular turns to herfor advice. She is like the Queen – she never complains and never explains.  Doria has a great warmth. Sheaposs a brilliant cook and is very motherly, but she isnapost someone who seeks attention, and for Harry her discretion and silence mean the world. Meghan has always trusted her completely but she has become a rock to Harry who, of course, lost his own mother so young. Sheaposs laid-back, and people see her nose ring and dreadlocks which are cool – but make no mistake, she has a core of steel. Underestimate her at your peril. Doria, who lives in Los Angeles,  has kept a dignied silence about her daughter while Meghanaposs estranged dad Thomas Markle has openly spoken about his relationship with her.  In addition his daughter Samantha Markle has been highly critical of her half-sibling even before Meghan fell out with her dad. Doria has always been someone who values her privacy and no more so than now, the confidante said. But she has been back and forth for the last few weeks. And when sheaposs not with them, she is on the phone constantly. On Saturday Thomas said his final wish is to be reunited with Meghan – and he will never give up trying.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Charles is being lambasted for taking three private jet flights in  days as he lectured world leaders on climate change issues. The royalaposs travel has reportedly racked up a whopping , air miles in jet journeys and also took a helicopter ride while on official Government business before meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Prince of Wales then used an electric Jaguar car to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos where he met the young Swedish activist after he urged leaders to take aposbold and imaginative actionapos on the environment.The Mail on Sunday today revealed details of the series of private jet flights, reporting that the princeaposs jet and helicopter travel amounted to , miles at a cost to the taxpayer of £,.The Prince is facing backlash over his travel as climate-change campaigning celebrities and high profile leaders who use private jets are increasingly hit with accusations of hypocrisy. The air travel is estimated to have caused  metric tons in carbon emissions, eighteen times an average Britaposs annual carbon footprint total. The newspaper took into account the five empty leg flights, in which the jets and a helicopter used to ferry the prince flew journeys without him either to collect or him orto their bases as he continued on to his next appointments. The flights included an empty flown flown from Vienna to Scotland to collect him, before he was flown to Muscat after the Queen asked him to pay his respects to the new Sultan of Oman. That jet was then flown back without the prince to its base in Vienna.  A new plane was then dispatched from Luton Airport in the UK to collect Charles from Muscat so a fresh crew could take him to the Queenaposs estate in Sandringham for royal crisis talks.There, he met with the Queen and Princes William and Harry to discuss the bid by his son and Meghan Markle to quit royal le and move to Canada.The Queenaposs helicopter was then dispatched from Hampshire to collect him from Sandringham. The chopper took him back to Scotland, it then carried on back to its base in Hampshire without the Prince. He then took a -mile journey by private jet from Scotland to Davos.  Later that same day he took another flight tallying up a further , air miles as he headed to Israel, where world leaders are getting set to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau tomorrow. The future King, who has campaigned for decades on environmental issues, was pictured alongside Greta Thunberg after he gave a speech to the forum in Davos, Switzerland urging environmental action. A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: Global travel is an inescapable part of the Prince’s role as a senior member of the Royal Family representing the UK overseas.  When he travels he does so at the request of the British Government. He does not choose the destinations any more than he chooses the means by which the journeys are undertaken.’ Muna Suleiman, of Friends Of The Earth, told the newspaper: Climate targets can’t be met without cutting pollution from aviation emissions, and private jets are a particularly wasteful way to travel.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSeedy messages sent by Britainaposs aposstrictest headteacherapos have been exposed by the brave teen he targeted. Cat Hughes, , has told how the aposflirtyapos messages from principal Toby Belfield, , ruined her le and gave her nightmares. Her plight led to safeguarding investigations at Ruthin School, a £,-a-year boarding school in North Wales. Cat, from Ruthin, has spoken publicly to North Wales Live about how the married teacher struck up a conversation with her in . He then bombarded her with messages for nine months - even sending them in the early hours of the morning. He told her she was cute and that she looked good in her blazer and said that flirting is fine. Mr Belfield also talked about breasts, virginity and sexuality and said he liked women small and petite. And he commented on how in more than % of schools the Principal would be sacked for sending chat messages to a pupil. Cat said the tone of the messages became more flirtatious after she reached her th birthday, but admitted they became so frequent they had a serious impact on her mental health. After screenshots of the messages came to light, an investigation was launched involving North Wales Police and Denbighshire Council. A number of recommendations were made but no criminal investigation was instigated. Mr Belfield had previously been dubbed Britainaposs strictest headteacher after he hit the headlines for threatening them with expulsionthey formed romantic relationships while attending the school.  He later backtracked on the policy that saw him warning pupils he would give them a worse reference for universitythey got a boyfriend or girlfriend while attending Ruthin. Meanwhile, another ex-pupil also came forward this week to share messages in which Mr Belfield tells her she is special, naughty and looks stunning in a dress. Regulators from Estyn and the Care Inspectorate Wales carried out unannounced inspections in the wake of the scandal and a damning CIW report revealed major safeguarding concerns at the school. Cat moved to Ruthin School from another high school in Year  when she was awarded a bursary after doing a scholarship exam. She said she hated it at first but started spending more time in school due to family problems and it was when she was in Year  that the messages from Mr Belfield started.  Speaking from her home, she said: At first, I thought it was fine. I heard he messaged other girls and I thought, this is quite nice, he likes me, heaposs taking an interest. At the start it was mainly holidays and family and plans for the future. But when I was struggling with personal issues, he carried on messaging me throughout the summer term, which was really nice for me. I felt valued. It felt like a privilege because it meant he liked me and I felt important and like I did matter.  But as the messages went on, there were some topics where I thought maybe he shouldnapost be saying that, but at the same time, you just think thataposs what heaposs like and give him the benefit of the doubt. She felt like she had to reply because she was worried she would lose her place at the prestigious schoolshe didnapost. When she started struggling more with personal issues, she said she was elated when Mr Belfield offered her weekly boarding in November . But shortly afterwards, she was admitted to hospital. The messages continued but this time, they were more personal.  Cat said: One said it would break his heartanything happened to me, that he did care about me and that I was special. At the time I just thought maybe he is a bit more invested in me than other students, which was a bit weird but at the same time, I didnapost have that from any one . When I went home during the holidays, I was getting more messages at am, am and because I needed my place, I felt like I had to reply. He used to tell me how he also messaged other girls at the school and even sent me some pictures of himself with them. Cat added: I got a message at .am on New Yearaposs Day and I remember thinking, bloody hell, you thought of me straight away, even my friends and my family donapost message me that quickly.  This is weird, Iaposm . Cat said she noticed the messages seemed to slow down while Mr Belfield was travelling but would start up again once he was in his hotel room, telling her what the countries he was in were like and how he felt being away from home and his we. It was always Mr Belfield who instigated conversations, she said. But while he was away, Cat admitted she felt more relaxed around school and that she could be herself more. As her mental health deteriorated, she felt his attitude towards her changed and she deactivated her Instagram to escape the relentless messages.  She said: I couldnapost handle talking to him and I didnapost want to block him because heaposd take it personally and I couldnapost risk that because I still needed my place. If I deactivated it, I could play it off as needing to revise but he sent someone to tell me he needed to be able to contact me and asked for my number. I didnapost want him having it so I reactivated my account. She added: The messages kept coming. A lot of it was about me being pretty in my blazer. Two days after my th birthday, the messages started getting more flirty. He started conversations about relationships and boyfriends saying things like aposshould I be jealousapos and how I would aposmake a terrible girlfriendapos.  He started using more emojis and love hearts. There was only a few occasions when I thought, no, thataposs wrong - one was when he was talking about one of my friends getting a place at Ruthin School because she was pretty. I remember thinking, you shouldnapost be saying that. He also asked meI had an eating disorder because I was skinny and I looked good. I did show the messages to people in school but I felt like people were too scared to do anything about it. I read back on them a lot now and I think how could you not see  Talking about Rachel Rileyaposs disproportionate breasts and all the other stuff.  Yes, it made me feel uncomfortable but I didnapost think anything was wrong with it at the time. I just thought it must be okay. Cat said she ended up having a break down and thataposs when a multi-disciplinary meeting was held. Mr Belfield gave her his personal mobile number in a message but she left the school shortly afterwards completing her GCSEs from a mental health unit and gaining an A and three Cs. She said: The control he had over me was just wrong.

Sources close to the Royal Family say Prince Charles and Prince William have been reaching out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to say they couldto the UK full-time,they wanted to, without having to resume their official royal duties. Courtiers fear the pressure on Vancouver Island, where the Sussexes are staying, will have a major impact on the couple, The Sunday Times reports. “The palace are very worried about the Sussexes, because they are vulnerable outside the embrace of the family,” a source said. “They are making contingency plans in case the Sussexes suddenly turn round and say: ‘Can we come back under your wing ’”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a warning over harassment by photographers, who, they say, are permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island home. They said there have been attempts to photograph the Sussexes inside their home using long range lenses. Meghan was photographed while out walking with the coupleaposs infant son, Archie, and her two dogs. Lawyers for the couple claim the photos were taken without her consent and that the photographer was hiding in the bushes and spying on her. This comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided to step back from their senior roles within the Royal Family. Under the terms of the deal agreed by Harry and Meghan, the Sussexes will keep Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate as their British home, but will repay the £.m used to renovate the property.  Royal officials believe that might be a place to protect the couple from media scrutiny. “You could bring them back to Frogmore to look after them. They wouldn’tto royal duties, but they could have a period of rehabilitation and recuperation,” a source said. Other locations where the couple could be brought are Sandringham and the Prince of Walesaposs house in Wales “This is a looking ahead thing. There’s no timeline here. But everybody agrees that this is a fragile couple. Nobody is going to say, no they can’t come back, the source added.

Scotland and northern areas of England and Ireland will see what could be the lowest temperatures of the season on Monday night, according to the Met Office.Snow is forecast for the highlands and high-level areas of northern England, where yellow weather warnings for ice are in place.Ice is also expected to sweep the rest of the country throughout the day, even reaching the south coast. Overnight temperatures will range from -C in sheltered areas of Scotland, to between -C and -C in Cornwall and Dorset. Four weather warnings have been put in place by the Met Office for snow and ice in the north, with roads and railways set to be ground to a halt in places.  While  flood alerts has also been issued, largely across south west and up to the Midlands, by the Environment Agency. Met Office Meteorologist Simon Partridge said: Thereaposs potential that we could see the coldest night of winter so far on Monday night going into Tuesday morning.  It dependswe have clear skies over snow for long enough. This leads to cold temperatures, and weaposll certainly have two cold days. Sleet and snow showers are forecast for Monday, which will bring icy patches to low ground and snow to higher ground.  He added a chilly breeze will also add to the wintry climes on Monday and Tuesday, although daytime temperatures will be near the average of around C for this time of year. The sudden plummeting temperatures are thanks to an ice blast from Greenland. Experts say a change in wind direction is to blame for the chill as the bitter Arctic air sends thermometers plunging.

Forecasters have issued yellow weather warnings for snow and ice in northern parts of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Experts say a change in wind direction is to blame for the chill as the bitter Arctic air sends thermometers plunging. Rain showers will turn increasingly wintry overnight on Sunday and will continue into Monday. Around -cm of snow is expected in the Pennines and in Scotland, where temperatures could go to as low as - degrees Celsius overnight. Helen Roberts from Met Office said: Itaposs going to be a shock to the system for many due to recent warmer temperatures. The change of wind direction air is coming from Greenland and the Arctic region, although the change will not be too drastic for most. Maximum temperatures around  or  degrees in the south while the north will be around  or  Celsius. Icy patches are expected to bring travel disruption for commuters as they start the working week. Around  road gritting lorries are set to be on duty -  in Scotland and  in England. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: “Donapost be caught out after mild winter weather. Slow down and pack a blanket and snacks in case you get stuck.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Thereaposs been almost no snow this winter for most – but the white stuff is finally on the way.  “A tongue of cold air is crossing the Atlantic from Canada, set to bring low-level snow.” Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: “Northern England may well see low-level snow for the first time, most likely in the North-West. “A dusting could also be seen on Exmoor, Dartmoor and Welsh hills, and possibly the Peak District. The Pennines and Scotland will certainly see snow. “Weaposre watching to seeweaposll issue further warnings for snow and ice on Monday night in the North. “Monday morning looks like -C in Scotland, and Monday night could beat the -.C coldest night this winter as temperatures fall over lying snow in Scotland. “- mph gales follow on Tuesday in the South-West as it turns milder,with mph gusts on Friday and Saturday as rain pushes across all of the country.” MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said: “A slushy covering on the Chilternsapos higher ground canapost be ruled out by Monday night, with -cm quite possible on the Pennines and Late District, and snow is possible in Glasgow.” Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: “Atlantic winds sourced from Canada will be chilly enough for wintry showers, with ice a wider issue as damp surfaces freeze.

Some called for the NBC news anchor to be sacked after a clip of the broadcast quickly went viral as the world reacted in shock to the death of the basketball great along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. In the clip the reporter appears begins to say what some claimed was aposLos Angeles n*****s,apos then quickly corrects herself, saying aposLos Angeles Lakers.apos The former New Yorker has denied using the racial slur as she apologised for the slip tonight. Alison Morris wrote that she had gone to say Knicks instead of Lakers by mistake, then corrected herself mid-word, saying aposNakers.apos Footage of her on-air stumble was recorded and posted online by swathes of furious viewers, with many demanding that MSNBC fire her and apologise. She wrote on Twitter: Earlier today, while reporting on the tragic news of Kobe Bryant’s passing, I unfortunately stuttered on air, combining the names of the Knicks and the Lakers to say aposNakers.apos  Please know I did not  would NEVER use a racist term. I apologize for the confusion this caused.    Viewers were fiercely ided over whether the anchor had said the aposnapos word or had become tongue-tied and stumbled over the word. Viewers were quick to defend her, pointing out her New York career roots and saying it was possible she had been about to call the aposLakersapos the aposKnicksapos, and had stumbled over the word as she realised her mistake. Footage of the broadcast began going viral shortly after the tragic news of Bryantaposs death, along with his young daughter and seven other people, in a helicopter crash emerged today. All nine aboard the chopper were killed in the tragic incident earlier today in Calabasas, an upscale neighbourhood near Los Angeles. Twitter users swtly accused the reporter of racism and urged the broadcaster to sack her, saying it was too offensive to be regarded as just a slip of the tongue. However not everyone was convinced she said the aposnapos word as Morris quickly became the target of a social media pile-on. Some suggested it was possible she had become tongue-tied during the live segment and said aposnakersapos instead of aposLakers.apos Twitter user @BaeAreaNiko wrote: How do you confuse Lakers with n****s  This is disgusting man....

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThrough the mist of yet ­another freezing dawn rising on the ­desolate, now silent, death camp of Auschwitz, Eva Schloss thought she saw a bear appear on the horizon. The emaciated -year-old girl could have easily been hallucinating, driven mad by starvation and relentless terror. It was eight months since the Austrian teenager had first arrived in this hell, and days since she and her mother awoke to find their filthy hut almost empty. The Nazis had fled from Soviet troops, taking prisoners with them on death marches that would kill most, to hide evidence of their crimes. They left behind only those souls on the brink of death. Eva and Elfriede should have gone with them, and surely perished. Their exhaustion meant they overslept and got left behind, awaking to “dead silence”.The bear was in fact a scout arriving ahead of the advancing Soviets who,  days later, would free Auschwitz and those clinging to le there. The -year-old, one of the few who was in Auschwitz for its liberation  years ago today, recalls this first moment of hope with a dazzling, lipsticked smile. She says: “We saw a huge creature in fur with icicles hanging from him, who, before it was daylight, looked like a bear. “When it came closer it turned out it was a Russian scout in a big Russian hat. He couldn’t speak our language. The Russians didn’t know about the camps, the gassing, that we were Jewish. But he looked at us, and knew we were victims.” Soberly, she reflects on the fact the fates of she and her playmate, the diarist Anne Frank, just one month younger, could so easily have swapped. Anne and her older sister Margot, who posthumously, became her famous step-sisters when her widowed mother married their widower father, Otto, were instead marched to Bergen-Bn where they died before British troops could free them three months later. “If Anne and Margot had not gone on that march, they’d have survived,” she insists, quietly. “We overslept, and that saved our le. Our positions could have changed easily.” Eva’s family and the Franks met in Amsterdam, where both fled to escape persecution. The girls would play on the street.  Eva remembers the day “chatterbox” Anne showed off the diary Otto had given her for her th birthday. “I remember her being so happy,” she smiles. “She liked writing so much, she loved telling stories.” Soon afterwards, the Franks went into hiding, and so did Eva’s family, who were eventually betrayed, and transported in May, . The Franks were discovered in September. Both families ended up in Auschwitz, but didn’t meet. Eva’s last memory of Anne is of the bubbly girl brandishing the diary which would, published by her father after the war, make her world-famous. Eva survived selection for the gas chambers because her mother gave her a wide-brimmed hat to hide her youth. “That was the first miracle,” she says. Every detail of Auschwitz remains crystal clear. “The filth, the dirt, no toilets. If they caught you sitting on a bucket you would be beaten. The indignity,” she recalls, sitting in her incongruously cosy North London flat. “The lice. We became covered in scabs and boils. And the starvation,” she says. “The cup of liquid in the morning, the chunk of bread at night.” Eva describes the growing sense of chaos in December . “We realised the Nazis were nervous,” she says. “A lot of the guards ran away.”  One night they announced they’d be leaving on a march, and Birkenau, the women’s sub-camp, was to be burned. It wasn’t, and they were left behind. “The camp was deserted, no dogs barking. There was dead silence,” Eva explains. There were around  ­prisoners left in Birkenau, she believes, and the same in the men’s camp. Eva remembers no other children. The only food was dregs. “There was a small pond and we hacked the ice to get water,” says Eva. Deaths were daily. The memory that terrorised Eva for years was moving bodies. “We had to heap them up. I tried to close their eyelids, but they were frozen,” she says. When the Soviets arrived she was joyful because she longed for food. “It was too soon to feel any joy of survival,” she says. “They gave us metal bowls of cabbage soup with strong bacon fat. We ate, and ate, and ate.”  The eating after months of starvation led to tragedy. “In the morning there were dead people,” Eva says. In the men’s camp, she saw Otto Frank. “He looked terrible,” Eva recalls. “He was asking, ‘Have you seen my girls ’” Two weeks later, the Soviets started transporting them to Odessa, now in Ukraine. The troops gave them their unorms for warmth – Eva kept hers for years. And as the women gained weight, they provided bras, she giggles. “It made me feel human, like a woman again,” she says. One night, the soldiers struck up music. “They showed me how to dance,” she says. “I began to feel like myself again.” In , she was to be reunited with some of them in Russia. But it was to be many years before she found happiness. Learning her father and brother, Erich and Heinz, had died left her depressed, and she considered suicide.

A wildle photographer captured the exact moment that a mother elephant left faeces on its babyaposs head. The photographer watched the series of events unfold in the Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. But whataposs not initially obvious is the fact thereaposs more to this action than meets the eye - and according to officials, the act actually helps the younger giants develop a strong immune system. Jens Cullman, a photographer, said: What I’ve heard is that when the baby get dung on it, it helps boost the baby’s immune system and maybe it’s some kind of bonding with the mother as well. I got photos of the calf looking towards me and then it gets up and the mum turns around and the calf follows her and then she drops her dung on him. The photos were exciting for me, I have to admit. Friends and family I’ve shown them to think they’re hilarious. Everyone was just ‘wow wow wow’.  So, in what seems like a very counterproductive move, poo actually helps the baby elephantaposs immune system. Photographer Jens added that these photos have a far more serious aspect to them than the dung incident. He said the mother elephant was skinny because of a bad dry season in the park, a lot of elephants and other animals having reportedly died or suffered.

Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the GLI-F cannister, which is described a ‘weapon of war’ in field manuals would no longer be issued to law and order officials. Mr Castaner on Sunday told France  television that too many demonstrators had been seriously injured. This is the reason I think we have to remove the GLI-F,’ said Mr Castaner, who said this would happen immediately. There have been continual disturbances on the streets of major French cities including Paris for more than a year as thousands protest against Emmanuel Macron’s government. The latest demonstrations are against pension reforms, but the Yellow Vest movement has also been consistently on the streets since November . Named after their distinctive fluorescent motoring jackets, the Vests started out protesting against rising fuel prices but now want a reform of the entire Fth Republic. Many of the Vests have been hit by the GLI-F, which is made up of teargas and an explosive charge of  grams of TNT. Riot squad officers frequently fire hundreds of rounds of the grenades on to crowds, in an attempt to control them. Up until now, France has been the only European country to deploy the GLI-F, which cause a deafening blast and can easily maim those hit. In February last year, a protester picked up one of the grenades outside the National Assembly, France’s Parliament in Paris, and lost four fingers. A man also had his hand torn off by one of the grenades in Bordeaux in December .  In May , the OF F – another type of grenade which was frequently used by French police – was banned after it was linked to the death of botanist Rémi Fraisse. Mr Fraise, who was also an environmental campaign, died at the age of  after one of the stun grenades was fired at him by police during a protest against the building of a dam near Toulouse. In November, a -year-old police brigadier received a two months suspended prison sentence for throwing part of a broken paving stone at Yellow Vest protesters in Paris.  In the first full-blown prosecution against the forces of law and order held in relation to the movement, the officer was solely identied only as officer A. Other Yellow Vests have lost their eyes after being hit by rubber aposdefensive bulletsapos.

Beijing International Airport was almost completely deserted yesterday evening, as shown by chilling photos taken by a passenger. Suzan Tokdemir, , took the pictures after travelling on an almost-empty flight into the Chinese capital city from Hong Kong. In one photo, which Suzan took on-board the Hong Kong Airlines flight, two members of the cabin crew can be seen wearing clinical masks over their mouths while they serve refreshments from the trolley. Another photo shows only three people outside the airport in a space that is usually very crowded. The airport in the Chinese capital city has ranked second-busiest airport in the world every year since  and usually sees between  and  million passengers pass through it a year. Suzan, who teaches English at an international middle school in Beijing, said: It was quite eerie. Itaposs not what youaposd expect at Beijing Airport. It took me  minutes from getting off the plane to standing outside the front of the airport - that included collecting my luggage, passport check, fingerprint scan, everything. On the flight, there were only about  passengers. I looked around as was getting off the plane, and I estimated there canapost have been much more than  people. It was one of the big planes, with eight seats across in a row, but they put us all at the back of the plane - the front half of the plane was completely empty.  All the flight attendants were masked, and most of the passengers were too. They took them off to eat the food and then put them straight back on. Before we got off, they came round and disinfected the plane, and there was an announcement telling people to declare any symptoms they might have, Suzan added. Suzan, who left Phuket, Thailand on Friday morning, and flew back to Beijing via Bangkok and Hong Kong, said it was spooky to see the numbers dwindle on each of her connecting flights. Even at Hong Kong airport, almost everyone was masked, she said. At Beijing International Airport, we had to keep taking our masks off, so that our faces could be identied - which sort of defeats the point.  She added that even the motorway in Beijing was empty, saying: Usually you can hardly move on the motorway. The coronavirus has emptied Beijing. I had hired a driver to take me home, and he got stopped by masked police on the way back and had his temperature checked. It was really spooky, it was like something out of a sci-fi movie, said Suzan.

I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that. I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me. My head was turned right away.“Obviously, not playing at St Johnstone made me want to come here.“The plan is to help the club get to where it wants to be, back in the Premiership.“We’re in the play-off spots now so, hopefully, we push and climb up to second.“Dundee United are going to win the league so the main thing for us is getting to the play-offs and going up that way.“We want to finish as high as possible.”Playing alongside and learning from quality players like Graham Dorrans is another reason why Callachan was happy to make the switch up the A, across Tayside.And he was delighted to see his team-mate sign a new deal this week.“He’s, obviously, played at a right high level and you can tell he’s a good player who can help the team.“Him signing a new deal can only be good for us.“It’s good for everyone we have that competition.“It’s good for the club and for the boys, competition is always good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KCes_Craigie_High_School_Police_Incident_Dundee_200519-14.jpg ","title":"major shake up of education in dundee to be debated as plans to merge craigie high and braeview academy unveiled","story":"A massive shake-up of education provision in Dundee has been unveiled by council leader John Alexander .The far-reaching proposals brought forward by Mr Alexander and his administration would see:Subject to consultation, a new £ million superschool, merging pupils from Braeview and Craigie, could be built at the former St Saviour#s High with a projected opening of .Braeview was ravaged by fire in September .

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove. That would take effect from August , so again there is a lead in time to give people the time to give feedback.#He told how boundaries are to be changed to help accommodate the uneven mix of schools which are under capacity and those which are over capacity both in primary and secondary.Turning his attention to the over side of the city, Mr Alexander said: #The re-alignment catchment areas for Harris Academy would remove Invergowrie and they would go to school in Perth.#Meanwhile, the future of a  much-vaunted new primary is also hanging in the balance — at least in the short-term.The council leader hinted that he understood that was likely to be a controversial decision.#We have also had a very detailed analysis of how many pupils in the area of Western Gateway and which schools they go to,# Mr Alexander continued.#There are  pupils on site , but we need to address the other issues with the priority being at the east end of the city, so Western Gateway is not a priority. This is not the time to do it and we cannot construct a primary school on the basis of  pupils.#We are not saying no to the school, but it is just not the right time now.

It’s been a great challenge.“The time on the ball you get is the big dference. In the States you get a bit more. vw, px\"  “Technically the leagues might be dferent but you are constantly pressing, moving and getting about the pitch.“That brings more demand on the physical side of the game. I have enjoyed that, though.“I think it’s added to my game. I did know what it was about before coming over but getting thrown right into it a year ago helped me out a lot.“I’ve had to adapt quite a lot.”Helping him adjust has been the arrival of fiancee Sarah after she signed as part of Celtic’s new professional ladies set-up .“She is excited to be over here,” Harkes added.“She has played for some really good teams and it’s exciting Celtic are getting up and running full-time.“Hopefully, it goes well for her there and it is nice to have her over here and playing.“With both of us footballers, we have been in dferent places usually but she came over here in August or September to train with them so she has been here a while.“That’s been nice and to get that opportunity at Celtic is huge for her career.”And Harkes would be delighted to join her as a top-flight professional later this year as the Tangerines go for the title, racing clear of the chasing Championship pack.Ahead of tomorrow’s clash with Greenock Morton, the midfielder, though, is aware that taking their foot off the pedal isn’t an option.“We don’t ever want to become complacent,” Harkes stressed.“We are in a good spot in the league but you never want to let that drop. Each game is tough in this league and we need to approach every one the same way.“Now we have separated ourselves from the rest of the league we have to keep it going.“Approach every game right and build on that lead.”That includes ignoring Tuesday night’s big cup replay against Hibs at Easter Road.“Tuesday is a big challenge but we have to focus tomorrow first,# he said.“Hopefully, we can get some good momentum and confidence to take into the replay but we know it will be tough.“Morton will come here tomorrow aiming to take points off us.”When United and Morton met in August, the Tangerines took the three points, putting six goals past a despondent Danny Rogers in the opposition goal .On the cup-tie, Harkes added: “Hibs were a good challenge for us last week.“It was maybe a chance missed for us being at home but I think we fought back well into the game.“Hopefully,we can start better than them on Tuesday then we’ll give them a run.“You could see when we settled into the game you could see we played well but we’ll need to do that from the start.“Morton comes first, though.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming

aimed at combating homelessness has achieved “signicant” early success, a charity boss has said.The Housing First scheme launched last April in six parts of Scotland – including in the city and Aberdeenshire.Statistics published last October show more than seven people are recorded as homeless in the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire area each day.The idea of the scheme is to reduce that figure by giving homeless people tenancies and providing them with extra support as long as they need it.New figures provided by the Aberdeen Cyrenians charity to the Evening Express show the scheme has provided homes to  people in the north-east.The participation rate – the figure that measures how many days service users have complied with their tenancies – is %.It has been so successful that Cyrenians, which is leading Housing First in the north-east, is planning to appoint some of the service users as peer support workers to provide role models for new people enrolling on the scheme.Cyrenians chief executive officer Mike Burns said: “These figures represent a signicant early success for Housing First.“Many of the people who are benefiting are people who have repeatedly identied themselves as homeless and who have cyclical needs.“Providing them with support through the project has helped free up resources for other people.“We are extremely pleased with the progress that has been made thanks to the partnership working between Cyrenians, Aberdeen Foyer, Turning Point Scotland and Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire councils.”One service user said: “I’ve been homeless about five times since I was .“I’d always just end up slipping back into addiction and intravenous use of heroin, taking fake Valium and stuff like that.“It was when Housing First Scotland got involved that I got this tenancy.“It is a brand new start for me.”The Scottish Government created a £. million pot to fund Housing First in October .Some of the cash came from funds raised by more than , people who slept out in Duthie Park one night in December  – an event organised by Social Bite, which also arranged sleep-out events in other parts of the country.Housing First will run until March  and is hoping to provide homes to at least  people by March ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.21042905-240x180.jpg

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

been calling for a station toto the village, on the East Coast Main Line, for more than  years.Currently, it is planned that the station will be open before , with campaigners calling for it to be in place as soon as possible.Now, a letter has been sent out to village residents highlighting upcoming work in the area.The letter reads: ldquoWe will shortly begin survey work and site investigation activity on railway land in your neighbourhood.ldquoThis work is required to help the design of a new station at East Linton.ldquoOur work will involve detailed survey activities, which may require us to cut back some vegetation.ldquoOur site investigation work also requires us to use drilling equipment to check ground conditions in proposed development sites.ldquoWhere possible, the work will be carried out during the day.ldquoHowever, some of our investigations need to be undertaken on the railway embankment or directly underneath the tracks.ldquoIn order to access these locations, we will need to carry out the work at night while trains are not operating.ldquoDuring this period of work, we will have a small compound located on site to provide facilities for our staff.ldquoThe compound will be set up from Saturday February  until our work is complete and will be located adjacent to the railway, with access taken through Orchardfield Estate, East Linton.The works come at the same

questions from Mr Gray, which he submitted in light of the decision to end the Abellio ScotRail contract three years early, indicated that Network Rail are progressing with the station designs with the intention of submitting a planning application later this year.Alongside the work required for completing the station, the cabinet secretary also highlighted that an industry working group is developing plans for the December  East Coast Main Line timetable, including services for East Linton.Mr Gray was pleased progress was being made but vowed to keep the pressure on to ensure there were no delays.He said: ldquoFollowing the governmentrsquos decision to cut short Abelliorsquos ScotRail franchise, I asked parliamentary questions about progress on delivering East Lintonrsquos new rail station in order to ensure the franchise decision will not affect the project.ldquoThankfully, while the replies from Mr Matheson have not provided an exact date for the completion of the project, they have offered some reassurance that the project is progressing and the new station should be delivered by  at the latest.ldquoThat is good news for people in East Linton who have been waiting such a long time for this important new infrastructure.ldquoHowever, while the progress is welcome, there is still a signicant way to go to before it is finalised and benefitting the local community.ldquoGiven all the delays we have endured, Irsquom fully committed to maintaining the pressure on Ministers to ensure the station is delivered.East Linton previously had a railway station, which closed in .It is expected the new station will be created to the west of the previous version."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-took-valium-drove-mcdonalds","story":"Ellie Watson arrived at the

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

We really do have a major problem here.\"If you look where I live at St Cyrus, we have got rocks on the beach that used to be  foot high, they have disappeared now.\"Either you spend poundm now, or spend poundm in five or less years time, or you put Montrose underwater ndash take your pick.\"A Scottish Government managing flood risk team briefing from two years ago, seen by The Herald, highlighted the need for action over sand dune erosion that \"affect the golf course and the town in Montrose\".At that point it was estimated that between  and  metres of beach had been lost to the sea since the early s and that the Montrose coastline could wear away by up to  metres over the next  years.The experts believed the coastline has been retreating since the s and has been disappearing at a rate of two metres a year.While some had favoured a poundm coastal hard rock armour defence to be put in place quickly, the team suggested that this would just transfer the problem where.At that point, the government had made available funding of pound million per year for  years to enable local authorities to invest in flood protection works.\"The problem is that we are hitting the bottom of the dunes, it is simply eroding the dunes,\" said Mr Adams. \"It is getting serious now ndash becauseit breaches there it could go into Montrose, on the wrong tide and the wrong wind.\"A solution is being sought with discussions being held involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Angus Council.\"We want the money pulled forward, we just need a solution for Montrose,\" said Mr Adams. \"It has to be substantial ndash you are talking millions.\"A  overview of the threat.Discussions about improving sea defences in Montrose have been going on for more than two years, but new surveys have been carried out because of concerns that the rate of erosion has increased with the two -hole links courses under threat.In  it was thought that a poundm cash injection from the Scottish Government would reinforce the beach and allow the dunes to recharge.\"Rock armour isnt the answer,\" said Mr Adams. \"Rock armour will work, but visibly it is awful. You are talking three miles. And at poundm every  metres it is bloody expensive.\"We have to find a solution and it has to be something that is sustainable.\"The other way to do it ndash a more sightly way ndash is to produce an island, which would be two or three kilometres long, slightly offshore. It will do something Annat Bank was doing, but in a dferent position.\"I believe that is what we need to aim for. It would last between  and  years. The material the MPA dredge out of the bay can be put on to it, in specic positions.\"It would be an engineered product, an engineered island offshore.\"The waves hit that further offshore, dissipate that, and you dont get that wave motion hitting the sand dunes at Montrose, and we need to get beach recharge as well.\"Prof Jim Hansom, the principal researcher of the Dynamic Coast project, who is finishing off an updated examination of the erosion threat to Scotlands coasts, said \"beach nourishment\" had to be a feature of any efforts to protect Montrose.: Open season. How Kelly Holmes has been part of a mental health podcast revolution.\"The bottom line is that the most effective defence against coastal erosion is a nice, big healthy beach that reconfigures its geometry depending on wave conditions,\" said Prof Hanson. \"So when the wave conditions are low, the beach is nice and flat and when wave energy is high the beach configures itself so that it is much steeper and more absorptive of wave energy.\"Unfortunately when we experience coastal erosion, we reach for engineers, and put a concrete seawall in its place. And a concrete sea wall is often exactly the wrong thing you need to be doing in those sorts of situations.\"A sea wall is going to be too expensive in Montrose and it is probably not going to be very effective on the beach. You want to keep the beach as a recreational asset, and you dont want to change its character, because it is a spectacular beach for all sorts of reasons.\"One view on the disappearing golf course.In , a UK climate change report warned rising seas and coastal erosion had left Montrose Golf Links ldquowith nowhere to go.And in the same year, Angus Council revealed Montrose Bay had been chosen as a ldquosuper site for research into the environmental problem.Montrose Port Authority has been accused of contributing to the erosion when it dredges in the area to keep the entrance to the towns harbour clear and then dumps the material in Lunan Bay a few miles to the south.Critics say this practice is \"wasting\" dredged material that could helped protect the dunes, and links director Chris Curnin has previously saidthe material was put on to Montrose beach in the ldquocorrect position it would have a ldquosignicant impact and slow down the erosion.However, the authority has long denied these claims, and an assessment it carried out in  said that episodic weather events ndash in particular wave direction and height ndash were linked to the greatest rates of coastal erosion in the area, which took place during the early s.This period also coincided with the production of a lower volume of dredged navigational channel material.It then insisted it must be able to continue dumping dredged material around Lunan Baythe port is to remain operational."},{"url":null,"title":"dont-rule-wildcat-scottish-independence-referendum---mhairi-black","story":"Mhairi Black made the comments in the Sunday Times as the First Minister gets set to lay out the next steps towards a fresh ballot.:The UK will neverto the European Union says David MartinThe SNP leadership has consistently stressed it does not support an unofficial independence vote and Ms Black has become the most senior figure to give some authority to the idea.An unofficial referendum would be open to a legal challenge.She told the newspaper: ldquoThere could be mileage in a consultative referendum because the Scottish question is complicated.ldquoThe current United Kingdom government position is weak and unsustainable, andthe last five years proves anything, it proves that what happens at Westminster is unpredictable.:Tom Gordon: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquonext stepsrsquo put her judgment on the lineThe MP forPaisley and Renfrewshire South added her preference would be to do the next referendum ldquoby the book and that an official referendum would ensure international recognition.She accepted a vote \"would then no doubt be challenged in the UK Supreme Court and the Supreme Court would have to make a decision.\"Black also said that she would support a referendum on whether Scotland should retain the monarch saying: Personally Im not a monarchist, Ive always been a republican and I would like to think there is a majority of Scots who take that view.

Here was a man who either thought it wise not to speculate about his job ahead of a promised Cabinet reshuffle, or he did not know where or what he was going to be come Saturday.There is a lot of job insecurity about Westminster and Whitehall at the moment due to the determination of the Prime Ministerrsquos chief aide, Dominic Cummings, to shake things up.Cummings popped up twice on The Andrew Marr show, first in the paper review and then in an interview with former Cabinet Secretary Lord Butler.First, the paper review.

When a chap has been private secretary to five PMs, from Edward Heath to Tony Blair, there is no shortage of other matters to discuss, but it would have been fun to know.Given his experience, Butler could offer a ldquobeen there, done that, got the memo perspective on Cummingsrsquo plans, among them bringing fresh blood into Whitehall.ldquoWhen I was head of the civil service we were bringing people in from outside, the civil service always has done, it did during the Second World War.Cummings was arguing for more data crunchers, scientists and managers, said Marr, instead of people with degrees in the classics and humanities.

My motto, for the sake of my grandchildren is \"better safe than sorry\".Rose Harvie, Dumbarton.IN focusing on the possible costs of carbon reduction actions Charles Wardrop, conveniently forgets another economic measure, the opportunity costs of not reducing these emissions.The distress and financial costs to Australian friends through the intense bush fires give just one cameo of the total likely to be incurred by the whole worldDonald Trump and Dr Wardrop succeed in persuading us not to bother cutting emissions. There is a technique in economics called discounting, which tries to compare costs incurred today with benefits which only accrue years later. This technique reduces the value of future benefits by a proportion for each year that elapses before they are achieved. The proportion is called the discount rate, and the higher it is, the lower a value is placed on benefits accruing in the future compared to their current cost. The value of the discount rate is related to current financial interest rates, so given the negligibleon investments at the moment with a bank rate below half of one percent, one would now expect the discount rate to be similarly low, and future benefits to be highly valued. Dr Wardrop and his ilk clearly do not recognise this, and would set a mental discount rate close to  per cent, totally devaluing future benefits.The last straw for any reasonable humanitarian is his suggestion that, because Scotlands emissions are only a small proportion of the global total, nothing need be done. So at what percentage of the total does it become morally necessary to take action  In Dr Wardrop and Mr Trumps world, there is no level at which emissions cannot be considered to be trivial. Future generations are likely to judge matters in a very dferent way.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IN an era of gloomy prophecies, the absurd Doomsday Clock claims to count down the seconds to a looming global apocalypse.

Hersquos seen a gang of men dig down into a den for an hour just for the privilege of letting their dogs tear a fox apart.:Time to really ban fox hunting in Scotland, for goodAll of it is against the law. In , the Protection of Wild MammalsAct banned the hunting of foxes with dogs, apart from an exemption for the purposes of pest control: according to the law, hunters can still use dogs to flush foxes out of cover so they can be shot. What this means is that, as soon as a fox breaks cover, the dogs should be called back. Either the fox is shot at that point or it gets away. The dogs cannot continue to chase it andthey do, it is a breach of the law.But letrsquos compare that to the hunt in the Borders, shall we  There are several men around, one on a quadbike, several on horseback none of them appear to be carrying guns, which you would expect to seethey were obeying the law. We see the fox break cover and about five minutes later we see the hounds following the scent. We do not hear anyone attempting to control the dogs or anyone calling them back, until the investigator steps forward.What the hunters say in response is that the public is being misled by anti-hunters. When I asked them about the incident in the Borders, the Jed Forest Hunt said there were guns present. Their spokesman at the Scottish Countryside Alliance also told me they were operating a legal pest control service in compliance with the  Act, whereas the League Against Cruel Sports was using the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices. The public are being deceived, said the spokesman.However, Irsquove seen the unedited footage. I have been out with the investigator on other investigations and I know what my common sense is telling me: the law on hunting is being broken in Scotland, regularly, openly and blatantly. As for the men and women who do it, the investigator says this of them: ldquoThey are setting a pack of dogs on to wild animals itrsquos like hare coursing. They may dress a little better and they may ride horses, but thatrsquos the only dference. When you see them out in the field, itrsquos savage.Whatrsquos galling for anyone who cares about putting a stop to fox hunting is that the response to the savagery has been spinelessness and a weak law thatrsquos failing to protect wild animals. The Bonomy Review into fox hunting in  said quite clearly that there was evidence that flushing foxes from cover was being used as a decoy for the continuation of traditional hunting practices, and last year the Scottish Government said it would put a stop to it and would bring forward a bill to strengthen the legislation.:Campaigners lodge petition to stop bloodthirsty US hunter from ing to ScotlandBut nothing has happened. There has been no real support either, as far as I can see, for the Green MSP Alison Johnstonersquos private memberrsquos bill which would do what the Government says it wants to do. The Government could fast-track that bill. It hasnrsquot.So what we need ndash quickly, before many more foxes are killed by dogs ndash is a law that deals with the situation as it really is. Men and women are out there, in Scotland, in the open, two or three times a week, for months on end, hunting and killing foxes with dogs, which means the law needs to ban the use of dogs altogether. Such a ban would also help expose the huntersrsquo claims that their aim is to control foxes. This is not about control. This is a sport. Itrsquos a hobby ndash a savage, bloody and barbaric hobby.What the Government needs to say to these people is: you cannot pursue your grubby little hobby here and we will pass a law to make sure you canrsquot. In the meantime, we are relying on the anti-hunters, and the investigators, and anyone with compassion, to keep up the pressure. There is hope of change in Scotland. But all I can hear right now is the sound of the horns and the call of the hounds. And all I can see is that young fox, eyes wide, running for her le."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-violinist-nicola-benedetti-honoured-win-grammy","story":"The Scottish musician was presented with the award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo for her performance of Marsalis: Violin Concerto Fiddle Dance Suite.She took to the stage to perform at the Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony, playing Bye Bye Breakdown by Wynton Marsalis from his Fiddle Dance Suite, with her performance streamed live internationally.Congrats Best Classical Instrumental Solo winner - \"Marsalis: Violin Concerto Fiddle Dance Suite\"@NickyBenedetti @CristiMacelaru, conductor @philorchWATCH: https:t.co iPjtszMCt #GRAMMYPremiere #GRAMMYs pic QbOXRnLYDdThe Decca Classics album features recordings of two works written specially for Benedetti by Marsalis - Violin Concerto in D and Fiddle Dance Suite for Solo Violin.:RSNO and Nicola Benedetti set example for post-Brexit ScotlandShe performs Violin Concerto in D with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the baton of Cristian Macelaru, who also won a Grammy for his role as conductor of the recording.Ms Benedetti said: \"I am so honoured to have won a Grammy for Best Classical Instrumental Solo and to have performed at the Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony.\"This recording project has been a deeply edying experience for me and one I will always reflect on with immense gratitude.\"It has been a privilege to learn and perform these two inspired and unequivocal masterpieces, and to deepen my understanding of Wyntons compositional language, cultural richness and philosophical insights.:Violin virtuoso Benedetti adds a teaching string to her bow\"Long-form musical pieces are often described as a journey and this sure has been a rich and fascinating one.\""},{"url":null,"title":"last call to nature fund applicants","story":"Nature enthusiasts are being encouraged to submit ambitious ideas to improve habitats, safeguard species and tackle the causes of bioersity loss.Applications are being invited for the latest round of the Bioersity Challenge Fund .But anyone applying will have to be quick – applications for this round must be received by midnight on Monday, February .

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When he first came to this country, in , his English was almost non-existent. He made many mistakes. On one occasion he put a letter in a bin bearing the legend LITTER. But he was a hard worker and a quick learner. And by the mid-s, he could hold his own at Scrabble. One of my memories of him involves him freaking out because he had forgotten the Italian word for grapefruit. It’s “pompelmo” – one of the few words I do remember from back then, along with “zanzari”and “fiammeri” .I wasn’t brought up bilingual. My dad worked long hours and I spent most of my time with my Scottish mum. Instead, I was sent to Saturday morning Italian classes, which I hated because most of the other children there spoke it at home. Now and again, my dad would decree the dinner table an Italian-only zone. Those nights I ate in sullen silence.Then, when I was , my dad died, and so, though I later went on to sit my Higher, I never became fluent enough to keep up with the noisy, free-flowing conversation that is integral to Italian family le.With hindsight, this feels like a pity. Being able to speak more than one language is a gt. It widens your horizons and makes you more employable Also, language and culture are intimately connected. A country’s language shapes its ideas as surely as it expresses them. It is fundamental to its identity and its sense of humour. When you do not share a language, it is dficult to share jokes. And the ability to share jokes is at the heart of human relationships.My lack of fluency was in part responsible for my eventual detachment from my Italian heritage. If your language skills are patchyyou are unable to grasp sub-text and innuendo and nuance, then, however hard you try to belong, you will always be on the outside looking in.I have been thinking about all this since I read about the Comhairle Nan Eilean Siarplan to increase bilingualism. From next year pupils starting primary will be taught in Gaelic, switching to English only in Primary , by which point speaking Gaelic ought to be second nature to them.The idea is inspired. Around , of the Western Isles’ population speak the language and more than half of parents already opt into Gaelic Medium Education . However, by making GME the default setting, with an opt-out for parents who are opposed, the local authority is positioning bilingualism as the norm.Anyone who has witnessed their primary school child being taught French as part of the Scottish government’s + policy will understand the limitations of trying to shoe-horn a foreign language into an overcrowded curriculum. GME overcomes those limitations. And it’s an approach that is increasingly popular where. The number of children enrolled in Canada’s French immersion schools rose by a fth between  to  as aspirational parents realised the educational benefits.In this context, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith’s intervention last week looks out of touch. She called the Western Isles’ move “deeply troubling” and suggested being taught in Gaelic could put pupils at a disadvantage. But there is no evidence for this. As human cognitive neuroscientist Dr Thomas Bak pointed out in a letter to The Scotsman such a view is based on the assumption that – as there is only a limited space in our brain – adding something new means taking something  away.“It assumes all pieces of knowledge that we learn are unconnected,” he wrote. “This is not the case. Every new piece of information we get is integrated with already existing knowledge and in this way can strengthen rather than weaken what we know already.”Studies show bilingual children outstrip their monoglot counterparts in cognitive tests and these advantages extend into later le with bilingualism linked to the delayed onset of dementia and better recovery after a stroke.Encouraging more Gaelic speaking will also redress some of the damage done by the  Education Act and help reconnect the next generation with their own culture. This pernicious piece of legislation put an end to Gaelic medium schools and punished those who continued to use the language.Establishment contempt for the country’s minority languages continued into the second half of the th century with those who expressed themselves in anything other than standard English still belted as late as the s.Not surprisingly this evocative language started to die out. Between  and , the number of Gaelic speakers dropped from , to , .In the s, however, there was a sht in thinking. Politicians began to realise the potential for Gaelic to revive depopulated areas and stimulate economic growth. There was increased funding for Gaelic arts, television and education, with Gaelic medium schools opening in the central belt as well as in traditional Gaelic-speaking areas.Until recently, there was a cross-party consensus on its importance. In , a law to protect and promote Gaelic was passed by the then Labour administration at Holyrood.As with much , however, Gaelic was re-politicised by the indyref with ultra unionists perceiving it as a nationalist totem. So now, every attempt to bolster it is met with a backlash. How much ink has been wasted whining about the cost of Gaelic road signs  Though, Transport Scotland says only £, was spent between  and , and the Scottish government has only ever received two complaints.The same sentiments have been expressed over the addition of Scots on to the primary school curriculum, although reading a handful of poems is unlikely to turn pupils into SNP activists.It’s not unusual, of course, for minority languages to face opposition. Disagreements over the Irish Language Act – which should give the Irish language equal status in Northern Ireland – contributed to the collapse of Stormont. But such hostility is short-sighted. Moderate and culturally-minded unionists understand this. Last week, Donald Cameron, Tory MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tweeted his support for the Western Isles’ plan . Distancing himself from Smith, he said his party had been promoting Gaelic for  years.This was not the first time Cameron had spoken up. In , he appealed to ultra unionists to tone down their rhetoric on the language. Having studied it himself, he understands its value.What the Western Isles is trying to do is impressive. If it succeeds it will produce a generation of children as much at home with Gaelic as with English. As someone who missed out on bilingualism, I’m glad its pupils are being given a skill that will keep them in touch with their heritage. And I find it deeply troubling that anyone would seek to stand in their way.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith it is my last week as an mep here is what i ll do","story":"By any standards this is a momentous week. No matter how you view Brexit, positively as theof large amounts of sovereignty to the UK, negatively as the abandonment of a progressive political project, or with sheer exasperation and boredom, leaving the European Union at  o#clock this Friday evening is an historical event.For me it also marks my last week as a Brexit Party member of the European Parliament, a week when I and my colleagues have to decide whether or not to give our backing to the government’s Withdrawal Agreement. For, despite the signatures of the EU Commission and UK Prime Minister, or that the Withdrawal Bill finally achieved parliamentary approval and received royal assent to become an Act – the European Parliament still has to give it its blessing, otherwise we shall leave the EU but without the transition arrangementsin place.Moreover, it also will mark what Nigel Farage has called the mothballing of the Brexit Party, our stepping back from political campaigning and the proffering of candidates in elections due in the coming months, such as mayoral contests and ious local council contests.All of these events are, of course, interlinked. The Prime Minister won a handsome majority of  MPs in the general election, giving him the mandate and power to pass his version of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. It was offered to, and received, the approval of the British people. Whatever the criticisms my party have, and they are both serious and legion, we did not win a single MP in what was, after all, the Brexit general election. Getting Brexit done was undeniably high on people’s agenda, no matter the quality of the “deal”. Boris Johnson managed to achieve that victory in large part because the Brexit Party chose to stand down all of its  parliamentary candidates who were ready to fight Tories in the seats they had won in . Nigel Farage took that decision because he secured from the Prime Minister commitments that stretched the Withdrawal Agreement further, promises that did not require the EU’s consent and would not have transpired had we capitulated like four MEP defectors had demanded. The first was that whatever happens in the coming negotiations for a future relationship with the EUthe -month transition period would end on  December of this year – with no further extension, which until the PM’s oath was being viewed as highly likely. This commitment has since been put into the Act and is now the law. To resile from it would require parliamentary approval, which while possible would be hugely embarrassing and put the Prime Minister in breach of trust with the British people. Johnson went further. He assured Farage he would seek a Canada EU-style trade agreement with no political alignment. This promise is also, thus far, on track to being delivered. The Chancellor, Savid Javid, has talked about the importance of the UK being able to erge away from EU regulations, behaving like any other normal country not enmeshed in the EU’s nets of bureaucratic arrangements, political trade-offs and international entanglements. Of course any British company seeking to export to the EU, be it parts for a car’s gearbox or the whole automobile, will need to comply with the regulations it has in place – just as they would need to comply with the rules of China or the United Statesthey were exporting there. What is dferent is UK companies that are not exporting to the EU, or indeed not exporting at all, will no longer need to comply with the EU’s internal market rules as they do now. We shall be able to erge – and, be they hairdressers, restaurateurs or the vast majority of our businesseswill be freed from previous restrictionswe choose to abolish them.Welcome though these commitments were, they did not change the fact that in itself the Withdrawal Agreement stinks. It betrays the Union by creating a customs border for trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain down the Irish Sea.Despite the Prime Minister’s repeated denials there will be no bureaucratic obstacles, local manufacturers in Ulster are already pointing to problems with paperwork. It leaves our fishing communities at the mercy of the Common Fisheries Policy for a year, with the continued threat that denying open access to the EU will be used by its negotiators as a deal-breaker for a wider trade deal on goods and services. Then there is the continued commitment to hand over nearly £ billion of public funds for financial commitments that would not stand normal tests of any independent scrutiny or audit. Nevertheless, the commitments given to Nigel Farage by the Prime Minister now give the UK negotiating team far greater leverage to agree a good future relationship from the EU than at any time since Theresa May decided recklessly to allow Michel Barnier to set the sequencing of the negotiating agenda. This week my colleagues and I shall have to decidewe can hold our noses and ignore the stench of a bad transition agreement because of the Prime Minister’s commitments to procuring something better in the next stage – consideringthe evidence before suggests he is indeed sincere on these matters. Were Johnson to go back on his word and seek another extension or sign away our futures, be in no doubt Nigel Farage will be dusting down his suit for yet one more comeback tour.Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch here s why the tories have it so wrong on gaelic","story":"Liz Smith should be proud. The Scottish Conservatives# education spokesperson has single-handedly propelled Gaelic to the top of Scotland#s cultural agenda with her roundly condemned snub to Scotland#s ancient language.The linguistic rammy began when Western Isles Councilannounced plans to provide only Gaelic medium educationin Primary . Parents can opt outthey want children taught in English. Last Thursday in Holyrood, Liz Smith said the move was “deeply troubling” and would put pupils in the Western Isles at a “distinct disadvantage.” Why Has Ms Smith not read the copious evidence which shows that bi-lingual childrenhave better job prospects and better cognitive health in later le  I’m sure she has. Liz Smith seems to take her job seriously and has always appeared well-briefed and relatively open to new ideas.So, does the Tory MSP just have a problem with Gaelic  If so, she must have missed the fact that Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschuregularly outperforms every other secondary in Glasgow, with half of sixth years achieving five or more Highers. Strange.Ms Smith has somehow also missed the fact that UK language studentslag behind only lawyers, medics and vets in employability. It also seems that even when language graduates are not employed to speak their primary language, the fact they’ve spoken two languages from a young age, makes it far easier to learn more. It’s this versatility, this aptitude for overcoming cultural barriers, this belief in the innate ability of humans to connect and this willingness to inhabit the mindset of other cultures that makes bi-lingual students so very valuable. But I suspect Liz Smith knows that. I’m also guessing Ms Smith agrees with Dr Thomas H. Bak, an expert in human cognitive neuroscienceat Edinburgh University, who observed in a letter to this paper: “There is a wealth of evidence suggesting bilingual children outperform monolingual ones on cognitive tests ... and these effects are not confined to childhood, [but] continue across the lespan leading to a slower cognitive ageing, delayed onset of dementia and better cognitive recovery after stroke. Remarkably, an improvement in attention has been documented in participants of all ages after a one-week intensive language course … in Gaelic.”I imagine she was also nodding at the views of Professor Wilson McLeod of Edinburgh University, who told a Sunday newspaper why no Mandarin or German-medium schools exist in Scotland“We have Gaelic medium education because parents fought like hell to get it. They organised, they mobilised, they petitioned, and lobbied councillors and just wouldn’t let go. There have been other programmes – there was one in Italian in Glasgow, one in French in Aberdeen. They have never really gone anywhere, there has never been a drive for it.”Quite. There’s a big drive to learn Gaelic at the moment – prompted in part by the young Gaels behind Scots Gaelic Duolingo. Perhaps Liz Smith hadn’t heard of this sassy new online learning package. I imagine she has now.Last year, this small group of Gaelic language activists successfully lobbied Duolingo – a free language learning  with more than  million users and  languages – to include Scots Gaelic. Now it has  thousand signed-up students – that’s twice as many as the official Gaelic-speaking total and includes , who joined in the wake of Liz Smith’s remarks, and a related newspaper article which attacked bi-lingual road-signs, the efficacy of Bòrd na Gàidhlig and the “sacred cow” status of the Gaelic language.Add in the patient, educational work of the Feisean movementthrough the medium of Gaelic since the s. Add in the inspirational influence of Gaelic-speaking musicians from Julie Fowlis and Karen Mathieson to Peat n Diesel and the director of Celtic Connections, Donald Shaw. Even folk who don’t speak Gaelic now know for sure they’re missing something. That wasn’t true even five years ago.Perhaps that’s why Liz Smith made a welcome about-turn this weekend when she tweeted an apology “to those members of the Gaelic community who have been offended. My concerns did not relate to the quality of GME teaching  learning, both of which have such a strong record”.Of course, that only raised more questions. If the standard of Gaelic Medium teaching isn’t the problem then what is  Many think it’s a straightforward belief that Gaelic’s a “loser language”. This kind of cultural cringe is certainly well-documented but also outdated and faintly embarrassing.As Argyll MSP and Brexit Minister Mike Russell tweeted last week “It’s very sad to see someone as intelligent as Liz Smith parroting such nonsense.” So, does the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe really share the tired, old, knuckle-dragging aversion to Scotland’s precious, traditional cultures  I’ll stick my neck out and say I don’t think so. More likely she has been sucked into the dark side of Toryism by the need to fit in with new political masters swept to power south of the Border on a xenophobic, anti-foreigner  of pro-Brexit isolationism.Last February, a BBC report showed that the places most likely to have no French or German teaching in school were the biggest Leave areas in England. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but maybe it reflects a worrying pushback against the sound of languages other than English being spoken in Britain. Does that pushback now include the indigenous languages of Scotland  If so, it’s a massively dangerous development.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll majority of scots now back holyrood power to hold independence referendum","story":"The majority of Scots believe the power to hold a second independence referendum should be held by Holyrood over Westminster, according to a poll.A sample of , respondents across the country took part in the survey, which was conducted by Survation for polling and pro-independence think-tank Progress Scotland from between January  and .It found % of those who expressed an opinion believe the Scottish Parliament should ultimately decide on the holding of a future independence referendum while % believe it should be Westminster. - Mhairi Black: A wildcat Scottish independence referendum should be considered Progress Scotland managing director Angus Robertson said: \"There is a strong majority amongst voters in Scotland that it should be the Scottish Parliament that decides on the future holding of an independence referendum.\"Last week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined the request from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for Holyrood to have the powers over such a vote.

A government source said: “The First Minister will outline things in more detail, but this policy is one that has worked well in Canada and Australia and within specic provinces and states there. They have shown it’s possible to have dferent approaches in dferent parts of a sovereign state.”In a document published last year “Scotland’s Population Needs and Migration Policy” the Scottish Government did explore how a devolved visa scheme could operate. The paper called for the devolution of migration policy “within a UK framework to meet Scotland’s needs” and said Scottish ministers would set the criteria and rules for a visa to enter the UK which would allow migrants to “live and work in Scotland with a Scottish tax code”, with holders unable to live where in the UK.It added: “The Scottish tax code is an example of an existing framework based on residence. Both migrants themselves and employers recruiting workers would have a choice of routes through the UK immigration system. They could still apply for one of the other visas within the UK immigration system, which would allow for living and working in Scotland with the ability to move where in the UK. “Alternatively, a devolved ‘Scottish visa’ would be an additional option for people who want to live, work and eventually settle in Scotland, and would not place additional administrative burdens on businesses or iniduals. “The ‘Scottish visa’ would be an extra option in the UK system, and not a separate bureaucratic process. The Scottish Government would want to work in partnership with the UK Government to deliver this additional ‘Scottish visa’.” The paper goes on to suggest that the Scottish visa would not have a “sponsorship role” for employers, which would “remove a signicant burden from the small and medium enterprises which make up a higher share of the economy in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. “Employers taking on someone holding this visa would not need to be licenced by the Home Office, as it would not be a sponsored visa. Furthermore, the immigration skills charge would not apply, as currently defined by the UK, and there would be no salary threshold – although earnings could be part of the selection process, encouraging highly skilled people to take up quality jobs in Scotland but not excluding anyone solely on the basis of salary. “Other countries such as Australia and Canada have regional immigration schemes to allow states and provinces to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes needed to benefit the local economy and local communities.”The announcement on a Scottish visa comes just a week after the First Minister attempted to reassure EU migrants ahead of Brexit telling them Scotland “is as much your home as it is my home” and urging them to remain in the country. She also said she understood the “resentment” at having to apply for the right to stay in the UK.Yesterday both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives gave a cautious welcome to the idea. Scottish Labour’s culture, tourism and external affairs spokesperson Claire Baker said: “Scottish Labour supports exploring a degree of flexibility within an overarching UK immigration system. We look forward to seeing the detail of the proposals.”A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives added: “We’re willing to look at any proposal which helps Scotland prosper in this new era.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Speaking to the BBCs Sunday Politics programme, Lord Trimble spoke about their visit to the families of Philip Allen and Damien Trainor - one a Protestant, one a Catholic - who were gunned down in a Co Armagh pub. The two friends were shot dead by the LVF more than twenty years ago in whats been described as one of the most sickening attacks of the Troubles. The SDLPs Mr Mallon and former UUP leader Lord Trimble visited their families in a powerful display of unity at the time. \"Seamus had come down from Markethill and I had come from Lisburn,\" Lord Trimble recalled. \"I came to the house of one of the victims and Seamus was there. My close protection officers were ushering me towards the car and Seamus said why dont we walk through the village and I said yes.\"Lord Trimble said the pair took their time walking through the village of Poyntzpass in March  so that they would be seen talking to each other. \"There are a number of people who told me after the event that when they saw that, they realised there was a possibility of things working. Up until then, politics in Northern Ireland hadnt worked and hadnt delivered. \"But now, people saw something which indicated maybe this time its going to be dferent, and of course it was.\"Speaking about when he and Mr Mallon first started working as First and Deputy First Minister, Lord Trimble said they were in a position of having to implement the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed that year. \"None of us had run anything before. The first few months were dficult but we very quickly developed a way of handling the issues and we worked closely together over a signicant period of time.\"When asked about their personal relationship outside of politics, Lord Trimble said he and Mr Mallon had to trust each other in order to work together. \"Theres no point in continually scoring points, youve got to actually work with the people who are there and work together to succeed.\"We had to get things done and that meant we had a working relationship and that means you can trust the other person and you have some idea of what the other person would want.\"He described Mr Mallon as someone who understood unionists and unionism. \"We knew his neighbours and he was friends with his neighbours and he had therefore a better view of things. \"Some nationalists dont have any understanding of unionism at all, Seamus was not one of them.\"Speaking of his last visit to Mr Mallon in Markethill, Co Armagh last week, he said: \"It was important to him and it was important to me too. When I left last Friday, I said I would come back next week but I didnt, because time ran out.\" On the same programme, SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said Mr Mallon rejected violence all his le. \"He stood against it in a very dficult way during a very dficult time. He did it against the forces of the state and he did it against paramilitarism and he did it without a gun in his hand, thats a brave and a dficult thing to do. \"When people wonder how he managed that, criticising the RUC and the UDR on one hand and going to the funeral of an RUC officer in the other, hes just telling the truth in that space, hes just saying violence is wrong, what the state and the paramilitaries were doing was also wrong and hes going to call it out, and he did call it out,\" he said. \"He was respected because he was unafraid and undeterred, he wasnt going to be put off by anybody and thats a real and a special kind of bravery.\"The former SDLP deputy leader died at home in the care of his family following a period of illness.His remains will repose at his late home until removal on Monday for Requiem Mass at midday in St James Church in Mullaghbrack. He will be buried afterwards in the adjoining cemetery."},{"url":null,"title":"nicole kidman set to star in belfast film the northman","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Leo Varadkar’s party has shown consistently in polls to be falling behind Fianna Fail, and within the margin of error to be neck-and-neck with Sinn Fein. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald Speaking on Sunday while canvassing, it was put to Mr Varadkar that his position on Sinn Fein was hypocritical, as he had long criticised the party for not restoring powersharing in Stormont sooner, and urged them back into government repeatedly in Northern Ireland.Mr Varadkar said that “the north is dferent”.“Northern Ireland is a devolved government, it’s not a sovereign state, and in Northern Ireland the Good Friday Agreement provided for what is effectively an all-party coalition,” he said.“I don’t think people comparing Stormont with a sovereign parliament like the Dail is an accurate comparison.”“The reason we have ruled out working with Sinn Fein is a point of principle,” he added. “Key policy decisions made by Sinn Fein are taken not by elected representatives but an Ard Comhairle, and we just don’t think that’s proper in a democratic society, and we also have a big problem with their stance on the Special Criminal Court .”Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have ruled out working with Sinn Fein, however current numbers in polling show neither could form a government alone, and even with the backing of preferred partners The Green Party and Labour, could still come up short.Fine Gael has indicated it would be willing to work with Fianna Fail – however, leader Micheal Martin has ruled out any such pact, noting that Mr Varadkar and his colleagues have maligned his party both before and during the campaign, and he has no interest in forming a government with them post February .Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said the two man parties “don’t want a republican about the place”, because it would challenge the status quo.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Rory Gallaghers side had two chances to win the game in stoppage time. First Shane Quinn blocked down Carlus McWilliams left-footed shot and Quinns interception stopped Brendan Rogers run in the last attack of the game. In the end, a share of the spoils was as much as Derry could hope for. Barring Shane McGuigans th minute goal, to level the game, they lacked the cutting edge to put Leitrim away. All too often, they coughed up possession when on the attack. googletag.cmd.push Watch: Its relief not to be beat - @Doiregaa boss Rory Gallagher #AllianzLeagues pic kdBqick — County Derry Post January ,     Derry had the breeze but registered two wides and dropped two efforts short before Ciaran McFaul opened the scoring in the eighth minute. The visitors were having great joy on the counter attack and went - up and deservedly so. Keith Beirne and Shane Moran were causing bother for Derrys defence. In the th minute it got worse for Derry. Goalkeeper Odhraacuten Lynch punched Domhnaill Flynns diagonal cross down into the path of Cillian McGloin, who jinked inside before roofing a shot to the net. Emmett Bradley and Ryan Bell hit points as Derry recovered but anytime they turned over the ball, Leitrim punished them on the break. googletag.cmd.push Liam McGoldrick and Chrissy McKaigue began to get to grips in defence and Derry began to gain confidence. Ciaran McFaul and Gavin ONeill were influential and started to go at Leitrim. ONeill passed to Emmett Bradley who hit a blockbuster to the top corner in the nd minute and Derry were within a point Eoghan Duffy, who had an earlier half-chance for goal saved, tied the game before skipper McKaigue put Derry - to - ahead at the break. Terry Hylands men, who bounced back from a hammering to Roscommon in the FBD league, hit the first four points of the second-half. They penned Derry into their own half and Domhnaill Flynns long-range effort was a sign of intent, before three Keith Beirne points put them in the driving seat. Just when Derry needed a spark, Emmett Bradley won a kick-out on the wing. Seconds later, when Ciaran McFauls high ball dropped in round the house, it was punched clear by goalkeeper Diarmuid McKiernan but Ryan Bell fed McGuigan who drilled to the net. Still it was Leitrim who got themselves back in front and looked the likely winners. With a minute to go, league debutant Ben McCarron fired over a beauty before McFaul levelled the game. Derry must pick up the pieces ahead of a trip to Paacuteirc Esler next Saturday to play Down managed by former Oakleaf selector Paddy Tally.

Another plus was the performance of Eamon McGill and Brian Oacuteg McGilligan at the heart of the Derry defence. Noted more as a forward, Darragh Cartin excelled in a new role at corner-back.

And the Derry champions face familiar opposition in their bid to join Wexford’s Buffer’s Alley in the history books as a result of Sarsfields getting the better of St Vincent’s, - to - in MacDonagh Park. The two teams met in the  and  Finals but the Galway representatives will be hoping for a dferent result at Croke Park on March . googletag.cmd.push Slaughtneil laid the foundation for their triumph in the first-half, when they had the wind in their favour and defended resolutely after the resumption against an outfit that has made tremendous progress in recent seasons, having lost an All-Ireland Junior Final just four years ago. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley inflicted much of the damage, hitting - of her personal tally of - in that opening period. Bradley’s fortuitous goal after  minutes was a key moment as her free flew all the way to the net at a juncture when Scarf Ogonnelloe were trailing by just a point. Bradley , Louise Dougan and Shannon Graham had all given Slaughtneil the lead but Marion Rodgers, Maireacutead Scanlan on the double had kept their Clare opponents very much in touch. googletag.cmd.push Therese Mallon rattled in a second goal just five minutes after Bradley’s strike, after receiving an excellent pass from Josie McMullan, and at the other end, Jolene Bradley saved splendidly from Rodgers, contributing to a - to - advantage at the break. That enabled Slaughtneil to dig in though Scarf Ogonnelloe threw everything at them after the resumption and kept the Ulster side to two points, from Graham and Tina Bradley. Rodgers , Lynda Daly and Scanlan raised white flags but they needed a goal and though the excellent Rodgers did strike, it was almost the last act of the game and too late to deny Slaughtneil. Contrary to Slaughtneil, Sarsfields did the damage in the second half, leading by just a point at the interval, - to -. It was a cagey opening period, Niamh Hetherton and skipper Ali Maguire doing well for Vincent’s, Siobhaacuten McGrath proving deadly accurate for Sarsfields. The youngest of four McGrath sisters on the team finished as top scorer with  points, two of those from play, but it was the second half goal of Rachel Murray six minutes into the second half that really turned the tide, as she deflected the sliotar to the net following Niamh McGrath’s long free. The Dublin team did have opportunities but the absence of injured former All-Star Aisling Maher was keenly felt. Sarsfields’ dominance was undoubted however, and Siobhaacuten McGrath was able to enjoy the luxury of opting to take points from two penalties, while siblings Niamh and Orlaith also got on the scoresheet for what was ultimately a comfortable victory.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “Over recent months, we have been reporting street lighting faults on an almost daily basis in every part of my constituency. The response has sadly been that due to budgetary constraints, the Department are only providing a limited street lighting repair service with priority repairs focused on emergency repairs, group outages and all day burners, followed by single light defects.”“This is alarming. Adequate street lighting is imperative to provide safe streets, deter crime and anti-social behaviour and crucially provides elderly residents with security and safety and the assurance that they are not isolated and alone. In some areas a single light can be % of the lighting in a cul-de-sac, so the fact that one light is out makes a real dference.”“Having raised the issue with the Divisional Office, I was advised this was due to budgetary constraints and until additional funds became available, only a limited repair service would be possible. I subsequently sought an intervention from the Permanent Secretary and sought details as to the extent of the problem.”“To my astonishment, the Department have now confirmed that almost , lights are out at present across the North. This is unacceptable and is a direct result of budget cuts. Last year the Street lighting budget was pound.m and it has been slashed by over a third to pound.m. Do people really think that when you strip out vital financial and human resources from a basic service that it will have no impact ”The SDLP Assemblyman added: This needs to be urgently addressed. I will continue to liaise with Departmental officials to press for action.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

January.The event will include contributions from some of Ireland’s leading sus- tainability experts and innovators.The theme of Dr Doherty’s address will be “Rethinking Green Spaces,” an area in which Derry City and Strabane District Council has been leading on with the recent publication of their pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan.Speaking ahead of the event, Dr Doherty noted the local authority had led the way in transforming the way its green spaces are used.“Transforming and valuing our local green spaces to benefit people, our economy and environment is a key priority for Derry City and Strabane District Council, which is outlined in our cutting edge Green Infrastructure Plan,” she said.“We are the first local authority in Northern Ireland to produce a Green Infrastructure Plan and associated action plan which highlights the signicant positive health implications of spending time in green spaces, the critical role ecosystem services play for mitigating against climate change, as well as the potential opportunities they offer for businesses to create jobs locally, for example, through expanding our greenway network.“We are currently in the process of assessing the monetary value of our green spaces through the creation of a Natural Capital Account in partnership with Vivid Economics and The Carnegie Trust.“This pioneering research will show the benefits of living close to a park or green area, which increases the value of property as well as providing a community space for people to socialise and exercise.“The results highlight that green areas provide signicant mental and physical wellbeing value as well as recreational benefits and improvements to the air that we breathe.”The National Sustainability Summit aims to enable visitors to keep up-to-date with the latest trends, innovations, best practice and new technological solutions available.The event will address areas such as optimising water usage, renewable energy, sustainable packaging, waste minimisation and moving towards a circular economy.It will also highlight how the power of data and technology can be harnessed to achieve more transparent supply chains. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking as the first phase of the scheme neared completion Kevin Campbell, development worker with the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team, said: “In the last few years it has become clear that there are increasing numbers of older residents in the Triax area who are experiencing problems maintaining the exterior of their homes or gardens, for whatever reason.” googletag.cmd.push “Recognising this, and working with Awards for All and other groups we have been able to design and fund a pilot programme of home assistance for older residents in three identied areas in the Triax area. This programme is obviously complementary to the ongoing work of the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team and helps us help harder to reach residents.” Mr Campbell continued: “The TNMT are delighted to be able to provide this assistance and in the next few months we will also be in the Iniscarn and Beechwood areas as this scheme rolls out. “As we work towards making the area a cleaner, safer and more welcoming place to live it is crucial we assist those who need assistance to make the dferences that matter to them. The Awards for All funded Home Assistance Programme is helping us to do that.” googletag.cmd.push Oakfield resident, Charles O’Donnell, who has helped roll out the scheme said: “Little did I realise when Kevin contacted me how the scheme would impact on iniduals within the Oakfield area. “After an initial assessment during which a multitude of homes were visited a list of properties which required urgent and essential work was drawn up. During the following two weeks nine of these received a iety of works from basic power washing, removal of large amounts of wasps and, in two particular cases extensive cutting back of hedges, brambles and trees.” “A particular highlight of strength of the scheme was the group of men who carried out the work. Good craic, kind, considerate, welcoming and extremely hard working are just a few words which describe the team.” Mr ODonnell concluded: “The residents and myself will be eternally grateful for their consideration and support. Sincere thanks to Donna, Kevin and the whole TRIAX team.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ldquoghost town.Mr Neal said: ldquoEventhe news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change ndash I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.ldquoWe have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.He said there is a support group for people who may need help and to get masks and some volunteers are going out to make deliveries.Ms Hunt said emailing andtrying to ring the authorities has brought a ldquouseless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go to the area.She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: ldquoAll we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news.ldquoAlthough it is hard us being stuck here, we know that it is the safest possible option for us at the moment. -- --Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Government was ldquolooking at all options to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlt from the city.One academic toldhis ldquobest guess was that , people had been infected with the flu-like virus.Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told the paper: ldquoThere are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now.ldquoUnless the Chinese manage to control this, and Irsquom sceptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.It comes as spectators celebrated Chinese New Year in central London, which marks the start of the Year of the Rat.Authorities in China have cancelled a host of events marking New Year as they expand their measures against the virus.Meanwhile, health officials are continuing to track down around , people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the area of China worst affected by the outbreak. The DoH confirmed it is trying to find ldquoas many passengers as we can who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing.It is understood Border Force officers have been recruited to help speed up the search for passengers as testing for the virus continues in the UK.A public health hub has been set up in Heathrow, staffed by a rotating team of seven clinicians working in shts to support patients on arrival.One British man, who had travelled to Wuhan to visit his girlfriend, is stuck in the city after hisflight on February  was cancelled, and he described trying to get out of the area as ldquoimpossible.The -year-old, who did not want to be named, told the PA news agency: ldquoThere is no news on when the airport will reopen therefore the airlinehave just cancelled the flight. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A performer wears a face mask during Chinese New Year celebrations in central London, which mark the start of the Year of the Rat  --ldquoIrsquove also had no help from the UK Embassy in Beijing who are conveniently closed for the weekend.Prof Whitty said following a meeting of the Governmentrsquos Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday that the virus looked ldquoa lot less dangerous than contracting Ebola, the recent coronavirus, Mers and ldquoprobably less dangerous than Sars virus.But he added: ldquoWhat we donrsquot know is how far itrsquos going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A member of the Chinese community in Manchester wearing a face mask  --ldquoWe all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.ldquoWe think therersquos a fair chance we may get some cases over time.ldquoOf course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: More than  UK coronavirus tests negative as Wuhan Britons urged to leave article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
